## The right hemisphere allows for the recogition of broad and complex patterns

The broader field of attention of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), open to whatever may be, coupled with how [the right hemisphere is able to access and hold larger quantities of information](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20able%20to%20access%20and%20hold%20larger%20quantities%20of%20information.md), is what makes possible the recognition of broad or complex patterns, the perception of the ‚Äòthing as a whole‚Äô, seeing the forest for the trees. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) takes a local short-term view, whereas the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) sees the bigger picture.
