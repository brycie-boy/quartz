## Caring about ethical matters is harmful for capitalist institutions because its not profitable  # 

The [[bourgeoisie]] can't care about the welfare of workers or protecting the environment because those things aren't profitable. [[Capitalism]] doesn't allow for businesses to be driven by ethics or morals or scruples. Because of the [[Capitalist businesses must turn a profit for the owners in order to survive]], only building profits will allow a company to survive. Anything that reduces profitability is inherently harmful to a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] entity.

Sure, sometimes profitability does line up with good causes. Sometimes it's cheaper to be more environmentally sustainable, for instance, or maybe donating to a charity will will result in a big tax break for the capitalists, or maybe it's just good marketing to support a worthy cause. But this is all just incidental. Don't be fooled for a moment into believing that the [[bourgeoisie]] cares about the welfare of society. It's all about the profit.
