## Prefrontal cortex  #🧠

The prefrontal [[cortex]] acts as the chief executive officer of the [[brain]] and plays an important role in [[executive functions]]. It is here that alternatives are weighed and choices considered. It is also here that emotionally driven impulses of the [[limbic system]] are evaluated and either given permission to go ahead or—if necessary—inhibited. It is also in the prefrontal cortex that social behaviors are learned.

Some of the areas (that I know of) that make up the prefrontal cortex include: 

- the [[orbitofrontal cortex]]
- the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]]
- the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]]
