## Prefrontal cortex  #üß†

The prefrontal [cortex]() acts as the chief executive officer of the [brain](Brain.md) and plays an important role in [executive functions](Executive%20functions.md). It is here that alternatives are weighed and choices considered. It is also here that emotionally driven impulses of the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) are evaluated and either given permission to go ahead or‚Äîif necessary‚Äîinhibited. It is also in the prefrontal cortex that social behaviors are learned.

Some of the areas (that I know of) that make up the prefrontal cortex include: 

* the [orbitofrontal cortex](Orbitofrontal%20cortex.md)
* the [ventromedial prefrontal cortex](Ventromedial%20prefrontal%20cortex.md)
* the [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex](Dorsolateral%20prefrontal%20cortex.md)
