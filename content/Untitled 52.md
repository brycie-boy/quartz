## Heading

This is how we come to know things and how activities like riding a bike become second nature. Patterns of thinking and movement that are automatic get stored in the [basal ganglia](Basal%20ganglia.md), [cerebellum](Cerebellum.md), and [brain stem](). Delegating fundamental knowledge and skills to these subconscious areas frees up the rest of the [brain](Brain.md) to continue adapting, and so we would not have to stop and think to process every thought and to remember how to perform every action.
