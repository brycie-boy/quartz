## Hypnotized consciousness  # 

In hypnotized consciousness, our models are considered to be the "real" universe and are projected outside ([[Idolatry]]). In this state, we are modeltheists, [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]], and mechanical; all [[perception]]s are passive mechanical acts rather than gambles ([[each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty]]). We unconsciously edit and select bits of existential experience and admit them to the "real" universe only after they have been processed to accord with the "laws" of the "real" universe ([[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]]). Hypnotized consciousness thus is that of the [[left hemisphere]], since [[the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]. 

Being mechanical and passive, we are also, or we experience ourselves as, dominated by the "real" universe and pushed here and there by its brutal impersonailty ([[The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]]). In this state of consciousness, we are like a person passively sitting in front of a TV, complaining about the rubbish in on the screen but unable to do anything but endure it.
