## Hypnotized consciousness

In hypnotized consciousness, our models are considered to be the "real" universe and are projected outside ([Idolatry](Idolatry.md)). In this state, we are modeltheists, [fundamentalists](Fundamentalism.md), and mechanical; all [perception](Perception.md)s are passive mechanical acts rather than gambles ([each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty](Each%20perception%20that%20we%20make%20is%20best%20considered%20to%20be%20a%20gamble%20rather%20than%20a%20certainty.md)). We unconsciously edit and select bits of existential experience and admit them to the "real" universe only after they have been processed to accord with the "laws" of the "real" universe ([Our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important](Our%20brains%20unconsciously%20focus%20on%20only%20a%20select%20few%20of%20the%20sensory%20signals%20it%20receives%20that%20it%20considers%20important.md)). Hypnotized consciousness thus is that of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), since [the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md). 

Being mechanical and passive, we are also, or we experience ourselves as, dominated by the "real" universe and pushed here and there by its brutal impersonailty ([The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world](The%20more%20certain%20of%20our%20views%20we%20become,%20the%20more%20we%20perceive%20ourselves%20to%20be%20victims%20of%20an%20impersonal%20world.md)). In this state of consciousness, we are like a person passively sitting in front of a TV, complaining about the rubbish in on the screen but unable to do anything but endure it.
