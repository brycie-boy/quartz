## Low-entropy state

* sleep of Albion, fall of man

A low-entropy mental state is way to suppress uncertainty in the human [brain](Brain.md) that is superior to a [high-entropy state](High-entropy%20state.md) that emerged with the evolution of the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), which is absent or undeveloped in lower animals and young children, and the emergence of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md). [Babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left](Babies%20and%20children%20are%20more%20reliant%20on%20the%20right%20hemisphere%20than%20the%20left.md). A low-entropy state involves the process is which [our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important](Our%20brains%20unconsciously%20focus%20on%20only%20a%20select%20few%20of%20the%20sensory%20signals%20it%20receives%20that%20it%20considers%20important.md), and [the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md).

Along with the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) and [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), a coherent sense of self or ‚Äò[ego](Ego.md)‚Äô emerges and, with that, the human capacity for self-reflection and reason. Magical thinking gives way to a more reality-bound style of thinking, governed by the [ego](Ego.md). For [William Blake](), this strengthening of the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), and the emergence of a strong sense of self is what casts us out of Eden, making us separate from the natural world. Growing up, in other words, is the equivalent of the biblical Fall.

This more highly evolved mode of cognition may be called secondary [consciousness](Consciousness.md). Secondary [consciousness](Consciousness.md) pays deference to reality and diligently seeks to represent the world as precisely as possible in order to minimize surprise and uncertainty. However, [if our capacity to impose order onto experience becomes overbearing, it may narrow cognition](If%20our%20capacity%20to%20impose%20order%20onto%20experience%20becomes%20overbearing,%20it%20may%20narrow%20cognition.md). At its extreme, a low-entropy state may lead to narrow or rigid thinking; [Idolatry](Idolatry.md); [addiction](Addiction.md); [obsessive-compulsive disorder](); [depression](Depression.md); anesthesia; and, finally, [coma]().
