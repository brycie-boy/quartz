## Low-entropy state # 

A low-entropy state is way to suppress uncertainty in the human [[brain]] that is superior to a [[high-entropy state]] and which emerged with the evolution of the [[default mode network]] and the [[left hemisphere]]. The [[default mode network]] is absent or undeveloped in lower animals and young children, and [[babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left]]. A low-entropy state involves the processes in which [[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]], and also how [[the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]. Along with the [[default mode network]] and [[left hemisphere]], a coherent sense of self or ‚Äò[[ego]]‚Äô emerges and, with that, the human capacity for self-reflection and reason. Magical thinking gives way to a more reality-bound style of thinking, governed by the [[ego]].

This more highly evolved mode of cognition may also be called secondary [[consciousness]]. Secondary [[consciousness]] pays deference to reality and diligently seeks to represent the world as precisely as possible in order to minimize surprise and uncertainty. However, [[if our capacity to impose order onto experience becomes overbearing, it may narrow cognition]]. At its extreme, a low-entropy state may lead to [[Idolatry]]; [[addiction]]; [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]; [[depression]]; anesthesia; and, finally, [[coma]].
