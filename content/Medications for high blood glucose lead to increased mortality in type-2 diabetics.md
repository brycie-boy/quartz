## Medications for high blood glucose lead to increased mortality in type-2 diabetics

A fasting [blood glucose]() level is the common test for [hyperglycemia]() ordered by your doctor in addition to testing your [cholesterol](Cholesterol.md). This test administered on type 2 [diabetics](Diabetes.md) will reflect high and fluctuating [glucose]() levels. Another blood test for chronically high [blood glucose]() levels is the [diabetes](Diabetes.md) biomarker [hemoglobin A1c](). If you have type 2 [diabetes](Diabetes.md) and run high [blood glucose]() levels, you‚Äôre at increased risk for disease in several [organ]()s, such as [retinopathy]() ([eye]()), [neuropathy]() (peripheral [neuron](Neuron.md)s), and [nephropathy]() ([kidney]()). And when diagnosed, your clinician is likely to prescribe medications such as oral [hypoglycemic]()s (glucose-lowering agents) and injectable [insulin](Insulin.md) to lower [blood glucose]() and [hemoglobin A1c]().

So why do these medications lead to increased mortality? Initially, it looked like these medicines made things better. There was an initial reduction in amputations in dialysis with intensive [blood glucose]() control. But the rates of type 2 [diabetes](Diabetes.md) continue to climb, and the potential side effects of these meds, which can include dizziness, drowsiness, heartburn, gastrointestinal distress, and seizures, continue to accrue. In fact, the side effects of [glucose]()-lowering meds are responsible for 100,000 ER visits in the US per year. Again, [modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it](Modern%20medicine%20tends%20to%20target%20the%20pathology%20of%20an%20illness%20rather%20than%20preventing%20it.md).
