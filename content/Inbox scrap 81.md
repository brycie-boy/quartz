Blake believed that the abstract, rationalising “Gods”   
of human culture were powerful instantiations of this power within   
the human brain, which he also termed “the Holy Reasoning Power”

85

85

Perhaps Blake’s equation of the orthodox God and the “Rational   
Power” may be of some succour to religious traditions that for centuries   
h  
ave had to defend their theism against an opposition which tends to pride itself on being uniquely rational, scientific, and logical. Perhaps   
B  
lake’s depiction of the Urizenic deity as a compelling and compulsive law-making, ordering, abstract God who values obedience, purity, and   
adherence to strict moral codes will make sense—that is to say, will   
seem reasonable. Indeed, such a “Power” may be familiar to both reli-gious and scientific acolytes. On the other hand, by rooting such a God   
so clearly and cogently within the networks and processes of Urizenic   
(left hemisphere) brain activity and values, Blake radically and effec-t  
ively collapses traditional theistic belief onto what would today be termed neurological circuitry. He locates the origin and source of such   
a deity, indeed all deities, within—  
within the human body and brain—and he does this, in my opinion, much more persuasively and precisely   
than many modern atheistic neuroscientists. If this identification of the   
traditional “God” with specific brain activities and functions presents a   
challenge to orthodox theistic belief, however, then even more provoca-tive is Blake’s suggestion that the very “God” worshipped throughout   
much of recorded history is an embodiment—indeed a deification—of   
Reason itself, “your-reason”. Not only is such a God presented as being   
grounded in the human brain but he is also revealed as being a pow-e  
rful instantiation not of divinity as such but of the “Holy Reasoning Power”: the Logos with neurological vengeance.

85

But if Blake’s arguments undermine the basis of popular religion,   
t  
hey also challenge the metaphysical foundations of popular science. Indeed, his arguments are even more damaging to the prevailing sci-entific ideology than to traditional theistic belief. Blake presents the   
materialistic and functionalist programs of contemporary rationality   
as a self-serving and self-reflecting interpretation of reality, one which   
distorts and conceals as much as it explains and reveals. Blake treats   
this aspect of Urizenic interpretation as essentially “religious” precisely   
because of this inability of reason to get beyond its own programs   
o  
r conceptual parameters: it is compelled to see existence in its own graven image, that is to say, according to its own indwelling and inher-ent processes and compulsions. It is self-deifying: the world according

86

to a machine program. Blake draws attention to the Urizenic basis of   
the arguments supposedly used to rationalise and challenge belief in   
religion, and suggests that that such a critique of theistic belief, whilst   
valid, is itself founded on the very same Urizenic (left hemisphere)   
processes and programs and is therefore trapped within its own cir-cularity—it is merely looking at itself, a confabulation or self-reflexive   
ratiocination. Moreover, it fails to apply this critique to itself. What we   
need, as Sheldrake has more recently noted, “is an enlightenment of the   
E  
nlightenment” (Sheldrake, 2012, p. 328). Blake was one of the first to d  
o just this: to apply the Enlightenment critique to mechanistic belief s  
ystem

“The left hemisphere’s world is ultimately narcissistic,” therefore, “in   
the sense that it sees the world ‘out there’ as no more than a reflection   
of itself” (M&E, p. 438). The reference to the myth of Narcissus is appro-priate as an image of left-hemispheric science, enamoured of its own   
reflected processes (although, as Edinger acutely points out, “Narcissus   
yearns to unite with himself just because he is alienated from his own   
being” and as such represents not so much “self-love but rather just the   
opposite, a frustrated state of yearning for a self-possession which does   
not yet exist”—the yearning for “Ahania”, in Blake’s terms; Edinger,   
1972, p. 161). In this way, the left hemisphere constructs not so much an   
“  
objective” world view but rather a world of “objects”: of conceptual, q  
uantifiable “pieces” (usually called “building blocks”), and everything which it encounters it interprets solely in a language of function, use,   
and discrete quantity, reflections of itself. It is impelled to impose these   
categories and imperatives onto whatever it observes, and into what-ever information it processes. This “essentially self-referring nature”   
of the left hemisphere constantly and severely compromises the claims   
to veracity and objectivity that its mode of operation seeks to deliver.   
“There is a reflexivity to the process, as if trapped in a hall of mirrors: it   
only discovers more of what it already knows, and it only does more of   
what it is doing” (M&E,

87

66

87

R  
ationality is, it seems, necessarily and fatally trapped within its own ratios. As Blake similarly noted, “Reason or the ratio of all we have   
already known” is not the same as it will be “when we know more”   
(NNR, p. 2). Rational knowledge works by looking back and by isolat-ing (i.e., altering) systems, and by filtering out. Abstraction is all about   
forgetting things, about leaving things out. As if these cognitive limita-tions weren’t constrictive enough however, reason is not even aware   
of the constrictions. Precisely because it is trapped it does not know   
it is trapped: hence the “hall of mirrors” in which it finds itself, in   
McGilchrist’s analogy.

Note: [[Consciousness seems to pervade all mentality because it is not conscious of what it isn't conscious of]]

87

These features of the dominant rational operating system were noticed   
and recorded by Blake two hundred years ago: “Man by his reason-ing power”, he observed, “can only compare & judge of what he has   
already perceiv’d. From a perception of only 3 senses or 3 elements   
none could deduce a fourth or fifth” (NNR, p. 2). And if all knowledge   
were simply rational, he adds, man would be necessarily and forever   
i  
mprisoned within the ratios of his existing knowledge, like a hamster in a mill. Thus, “if it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the   
P  
hilosophic & Experimental would soon be at the ratio of all things & stand still, unable to do other than repeat the same dull round over   
again” (NNR, p. 3). Like Shelley, Blake realises that imagination actually   
runs the operating system, which is why new knowledge is possible.

87

The “mill”-like aspect of rationality was repeatedly alluded to by   
Blake. As he notes in his poem Milton, in a passage referring to the   
dominance of Urizenic systems of control within the psyche of man,   
“To Mortals thy Mills seem every thing” (Mil   
4:12, p. 98). Blake observes that man by his reasoning power increasingly becomes bound to (and   
locked into) these systems, intended to liberate him, as reason becomes   
increasingly dominant and imperious and severed from imaginative   
reality, denying even the existence of the “Poetic or Prophetic charac-t  
er”, upon which new discoveries depend.I turn my eyes to the Schools & Universities of Europe

Blake draws our attention here to the political and social dimension   
o  
f Newtonian mechanics. These enormous cognitive “wheels without wheels” gradually materialise as literal machinery, the “dark Satanic   
wheels” of industrialism within which Urizen itself becomes increas-i  
ngly fixed and contained, as do of course all the humans compelled to work at these wheels (J 12:44, p. 156). And the same process of increas-ing Urizenic and mechanistic domination of humanity, which happens   
within each human brain, correspondingly happens within each nation

As Damon notes, “the ‘starry wheels’ of Albion’s Sons represent their   
materialistic thought and consequently the mechanical Newtonian uni-v  
erse” (Damon, p. 445): in Blake’s poetry even Urizen complains at his inability to leave these self-generated, self-referential mechanisms. Thus   
for example, in The Four Zoas   
Blake suggests that the “Rational Power” itself ca

mechanistic programming (FZ vi:196, p. 349). Reason recognises that   
the world it has created is not only useful, but also completely joyless.

Indeed, as Blake’s earliest prose pamphlets attempt to set out, reason   
c  
an only work by limiting itself: by establishing a closed, finite system, and then analysing and distinguishing its parts (NNR,  
pp. 2–3). This is, after all, its modus operandi, and part of its hugely successful ana-lytical capacity. Its evolutionary and epistemological basis is built on   
its ability to focus on only a small portion of reality in order to be able   
to retrospectively analyse and then manipulate it. In many ways, this   
“  
limiting” capacity is one of the most valuable and defining aspects of what reason actually is: as Blake remarked, “Energy is the only life and   
is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of   
Energy” (MHH 4, p. 34). This limiting or bounding function, however,   
e  
ntails that its own vision or mode of cognition, its claim to objectivity and veracity, is paradoxically comprised. It sees its mill-like systems,   
i  
ts “many Wheels … wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic/Moving by compulsion each other” everywhere because rationality, not real-ity, is mechanistic (J 15:18–20, p. 159). But through an unfortunate and   
in-built combination of intransigent and profound literalism, and an   
inherent desire to dominate, it wants and is compelled to claim more.   
It claims and aspires to know “reality” itself: whereas in reality it is   
simply confined to imposing and constructing its own mode of know-ing on whatever experience or new data it comes across. The further it   
explores its vision of the world, the more, curiously, it ends up seeing   
itself. As Blake observed, succinctly contrasting the two (the imagina-t  
ive and the rational) modes of attention available to the human brain: “  
He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only” (NNR, p. 3). Interestingly, McGilchrist cites this   
passage from Blake in order to illustrate hemispheric difference, pro-viding a useful neuroscientific interpretation of it in brackets: “He who   
sees the Infinite [looks outward to the ever-becoming with the right   
hemisphere] in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only [looks at   
the self-defined world brought into being by the left hemisphere] sees   
himself only [the left hemisphere is self-reflexive]” (M&E, p. 379). Rea-son discerns and measures the ratios of things: it constructs a virtual,   
s  
elf-enclosed system for itself, and then applies itself to analysing and m  
anipulating this system. In this it can be magnificently useful: it can provide highly complex, valuable fictional models through which we   
can navigate and utilise the world around us. But the reality, as they say,

90

is not the map. In so examining and quantifying the universe the irony   
is that the purely rationalistic left hemisphere ends up measuring itself,   
seeing its own automatic (or unconscious) processes reflected back, and   
ultimately therefore knowing only itself: it only sees the sort of universe   
that it is constructed to see. Reason, like a one-eyed myopic deity, can-not see itself as a way of seeing, only as the 

90

Blake does not deny the reality of Urizenic brain   
processes or their usefulness for certain operations: he was (as we shall   
see in the concluding chapter) not against reason or science at all per se,  
but he profoundly objected to the usurpation by reason as the sole and   
primary mode of attention and knowledge that the human body pos-sesses. This, in his vocabulary, is not science or reason, but “fallen” or   
divided reason (i.e., post-Newtonian science)—reason completely sev-ered from its imaginative and contextual origins, trapped within its   
narcissistic matrix and blithely but blindly unable even to understand   
its own mode of exegesis or operation. For Blake, this is not real sci-ence but “Bad Science” (LJ 94, p. 565). As Damon notes, for Blake “True   
Science is eternal and essential, but it turns bad when it cuts lose from   
Humanity and runs wild, abstracting, generalizing, and domineering”   
(Damon, p. 359). Severed from reality, it is therefore perhaps unsurpris-ing that the mechanistic programs of the Urizenic left brain should pro-duce a “science” which interprets everything according to its pre-set   
functions, and a world that seems to justify its methodology. How else   
could a machine programmed to abstract and divide existence and then   
recombine it into a myriad of artificially separated “parts” and neatly   
ordered linear, logical sequences,—how else could it possibly see the   
universe? Of course it sees it like this. In a hall of mirrors, everything   
looks like a reflection—or, in McGilchrist’s apposite image, “to a man   
with a hammer everything begins to look like a nail” (M&E,

90

Once we are attuned to this feature

91

of the rationalistic program, however, we can become aware of this   
unconscious tendency. Useful markers to spot this program at work are   
references to such concepts and fictions as “building blocks”, “systems”,   
“machines”, and “atoms”—these are the trails of its cognitive conver-sion of reality into its own image. And they permeate scientific dis-course. Most scientists are probably not even aware that the use of a   
“machine” model to describe some specific feature of being, is   
a model: their levels of unconsciousness with respect to their own use of meta-phor often seem to be completely hidden to them. Just as many scien-t  
ists berate earlier peoples for “literally” believing in wood sprites or river nymphs, so those same scientists fail to see the internal combus-tion engine in their own eye.

91

70

91

what Urizen loves to concep-tualise about are “atoms”—fictional, finite “units” of thought, “bits”,   
upon which it can then base its subsequent systems. Indeed, it more   
than “loves” to conceptualise about these: it absolutely needs   
them, and is compelled to deliver them. Without this belief—and, as we shall   
see, it is a belief (or as a scientist would say, it is “only” a belief)—in   
something “substantial” and “rock-like” upon which to construct its   
elaborate rationalistic edifices, the left brain becomes prey to the most   
paranoid and destabilising uncertainty. Without its precious (fictional)   
“building blocks” it feels to the rationalising program that its immense

92

computational and evaluative processes have nothing to stand on,   
therefore no “under-standing”, no “sub-stance” (and therefore no sub-stance), and therefore as if they were immaterial, “base-less”—well,   
y

92

92

There is, of course,   
a way of looking at it, if one wants to impose that way, in which it can   
b  
e said to be “like” a machine, for certain purposes. But, (and this is “really” my point), this is not what these scientists are saying. They are   
trying to convince us that they are describing reality, not describing a   
model. As McGilchrist has acutely argued, “the model we chose to use   
to understand something determines what we find”: “There is always   
a model by which we are understanding, an exemplar with which we   
are comparing, what we see, and where it is not identified it usually

93

means that we have tacitly adopted the model of the machine” (M&E,  
p. 97, p. 29). And as he also notes, this tacit adoption has consequences:   
the model we use actually alters what sort of reality we find, or uncover.   
In “tacitly adopting” the machine model, science and the Urizenic left-brain rationalistic programs upon which it is constructed, deftly employs   
a  
cognitive, self-justifying sleight of hand. This has ramifications for the whole of the post-Newtonian scientific project, as McGilchrist also   
notes. For the modern “scientific” stance is itself, he points out “value-l  
aden”: “It is just one particular way of looking at things, a way which p  
rivileges detachment, a lack of commitment of the viewer to the object v  
iewed. For some purposes this can be undeniably useful. But its use in such cases does not make it truer or more real, closer to the nature of   
things” (M&E, p. 28). One can see the world in a detached and function-alist way, or in an engaged and imaginative way: the detached mode is   
not “truer or more real”. Indeed, it is perhaps not even “scientific”, as   
we have come to understand the word—it is simply “detached”. Such   
s  
cience has a point: it is not so much concerned with understanding the w  
orld as about how to exert power over it. Its mode of attention to the world, its cognitive programs and processes are geared to this agenda,   
to this emotional quest for certainty and control. Science allows us this   
control and power, and has produced many useful and remarkable   
results as a consequence of its “lack of commitment of the viewer to   
t  
he object viewed”. But especially since Newton and Bacon and Locke, i  
t has made additional epistemological claims to “know”, to know how things “really” are. This is perhaps unfortunate as it seems that cogni-tive limitations are built into its very neurological circuits, and what   
allows it to manipulate also prevents it from recognising the walls of   
its own prison. “If we assume a purely mechanical universe and take   
t  
he machine as our model,” McGilchrist concludes, “we will uncover the view that—surprise, surprise—the body, and the brain with it, is   
a  
machine” (ibid., pp. 97–98). The mechanical model of the universe is at best, like religion, simply a useful fiction. It is the default mode of   
o  
peration (or metaphor) of the left brain: a utilitarian way of analysing t  
hi

93

T  
he left-hemispheric way of operating, McGilchrist also notes, is “to s  
tep outside the flow of experience and ‘experience’ our experience in a special way: to re-present the world in a form that is less truthful,

94

but … more useful for manipulation.” “From this world we feel   
detached,” he acknowledges, “but in relation to it we are powerful”   
(M&E, p. 93). Under this rather Medusean stare of modern science, the   
relation (or “betweenness”) between subject and object, is however not   
absent, he adds: “The betweenness is not absent, just denied, and there-fore of a particular—particularly ‘cold’—kind”.  
The relationship implied by the left-hemisphere attention brought   
to bear through the scientific method, with its implied materialism,   
is not no relationship—merely a disengaged relationship, imply-ing, incorrectly, that the observer does not have an impact on the   
observed … When science adopts a view of its object from which   
everything ‘human’ has as far as possible been removed, bringing a   
focussed, but utterly detached attention to bear, it is merely exercis-ing another human faculty, that of standing back from something   
and seeing it in this detached, in some important sense denatured,   
way. There is no reason to see that particular way as privileged,   
except that it enables us to do certain things more easily, to use   
things, to have power over things—the preoccupation of the left   
hemisphere. [M&E,  
p. 166]T  
his is a formidable analysis of the scientific mode of attention. It points out that a detached stance still involves and requires a relationship with   
t  
he subject: it is not “objective”, at least not in the sense that it would like to make itself out to be. And neither is it a “non-human” mode   
of enquiry: rather, it is a peculiarly cold, human mode of enquiry. Its   
great value, and virtue, is use: “it enables us to do certain things more   
easily”. Its great limitation and defect is its unreality. This understanding   
of the nature of left hemisphere cognition is useful for grasping Blake’s   
own critique of these abstracting and rationalising processes within   
the human brain. The peculiarly “cold” nature of Urizenic attention is   
repeatedly emphasised by Blake and is one of Urizen’s most striking   
features. As the divided Spectre of Urizen, rising “like a hoar frost &   
a Mildew” over Albion, pompously declares: “I am God O Sons of Men!   
I  
am your Rational Power!/Am I not Bacon & Newton & Locke who teach Humility [i.e., self-doubt] to Man!”. “So spoke the hard cold con-strictive Spectre” (J   
54:15–25, pp. 203–04). Blake shows Urizen claiming a  
uthority and legitimacy for the whole cognitive understanding of the human brain and therefore human experience. Its “hard cold constric-tive” mode of attention brilliantly captures the detached and peculiarly

95

frosty nature of the left-hemispheric stance, as McGilchrist remarks.   
Coldness and opacity are constantly associated with the Urizenic mode   
and activities. Blake urges man to become aware of these unconscious   
processes within Urizenic reasoning, lest we fall prey or submit to their   
metaphors: “Awake Albion awake! Reclaim thy Reasoning Spectre”   
(Mil 39:10, p. 140). For Reason’s attempt to disengage its own body, to   
sever and mechanise its own humanity, to conceal its own metaphors   
a  
nd its own values, lies for Blake at the heart of contemporary Urizenic d  
ominance. It is a particularly powerful and equally particularly myopic mode of attention, one geared,

95

95

(PubA   
46, p. 575). Blake was writing at the very start of the machine age, and indeed Ackroyd has described   
his work as “one of the most important and perceptive accounts of the   
industrial and commercial systems that were changing the very prac-tice of art in his lifetime” (Ackroyd, 1995, p. 307). In 1809 Blake was   
becoming increasingly marginalised and even considered “mad”—an   
“unfortunate lunatic” according to The Examiner—  
for opposing these processes (ibid., p. 304). It is perhaps fitting in this respect to note that

96

recent neurological research into a variety of pronounced and highly   
disturbed mental conditions are now being linked with forms of dissoci-ated and hyper-rationality itself. As McGilchrist remarks, “‘to lose one’s   
reason’ is the old expression for madness. But an excess of rationality   
is the grounds of another kind of madness, that of schizophrenia.” And   
h  
e makes the additional point that “it is significant that the ‘normal’ scientific materialist view of the body is similar to that found in schizo-phrenia. Schizophrenic subjects routinely see themselves as machines—  
often robots, computers, or cameras—and sometimes declare that parts   
of them have been replaced by metal or electronic components” (M&E,  
p. 332, p. 439). This connection between literalist belief in the mechani-cal mode and seriously disturbed mental states such as schizophrenia   
(and also, as we shall see later, certain forms of psychopathy) is a fas-cinating and disturbing aspect to what is going on within the contem-porary scientific community, and “the ‘normal’ scientific materialistic   
v

96

The phrase which Blake most commonly uses to describe the self-reflective and myopic way of looking at things, so characteristic   
o  
f Urizenic left-brain attention, is “Single vision” (Letter to Butts, 22 November 1802, p. 722).

97

76

97

1  
972, pp. 220–246.) What Blake calls “Single vision” seems to be the only mode of perception available to Urizenic consciousness. It is not   
so much what hyper-rationalising science sees that is the problem—  
though this is a problem—but what it does not see: “In ignorance to   
view a small portion & think that All,/And call it Demonstration”   
(J 

97

B  
eing the mode of attention, or knowledge, of only half of the brain, the dissociated rational mode of enquiry is not only “single” in a lit-eral sense, but also refers in itself to the “literal” nature of rational con-sciousness, perhaps resulting in part from its pronounced detachment   
from context (contextual understanding being a right hemisphere trait)   
as well as from emotional and imaginative frameworks which might   
make it less literalist. These latter concerns are all right-hemispheric   
qualities, qualities that the left-brain reason seeks to detach itself from   
in order to make it more “rational”. As Bolte Taylor observes, “without   
the right hemisphere’s ability to evaluate communication in the context   
of the bigger picture, the left hemisphere tends to interpret everything   
literally.” She illustrates this literalisation (or lateralisation) hazard with   
a  
useful instance of typical left-brain hermeneutics:For example, if I am playing blackjack at a party and I say, “hit me!”   
a person with a damaged right hemisphere may think I am asking   
him to physically strike me rather than understand that I am sim-ply asking for another card. [JBT,  
p. 34]L  
eft-hemispheric science sometimes feels like a whole series of such “hit me!”s. Everything it sees is literal. Everything it sees, it sees literally.   
When confronted with imaginative and poetic texts far more sophisti-cated and complex than itself, such as the Book of Genesis, it interprets   
those literally too. And of course it interprets bodily existence—this   
world—more literally than anything else. As Blakeslee has observed,   
commenting on this intriguing feature of left-brain information   
processing, “removal of the right hemisphere (left brain intact) leaves

98

language basically unimpaired but somewhat computer-like. While   
the precise literal meaning of words is understood perfectly, metaphor,   
inflection, and emotional tone are not. Personality, insight, imagination,   
and initiative also suffer greatly” (Blakeslee, 1980, p. 17).

98

77

98

The focus of modern science can sometimes resemble this form of   
hemispherectomical “single” vision: as we have seen, textbook sci-ence tends to represent the world both literally and mechanically,   
functionally—a world without emotion, nuance, metaphor, inflection,   
personality, insight, or imagination. Or, as science calls it, “objectively”.   
T  
his is the disengaged “Single vision” that Blake noticed and challenged so directly in contemporary rationalistic discourse, and he consistently   
linked it with the mode of enquiry established and developed through   
post-Newtonian science. “May God us keep/From Single vision   
& Newtons sleep” (Letter to Butts, 22 November 1802, p. 722). Left-brain rationality interprets reality this way not because reality is like a   
machine but because the left brain is. As Howard Gardner observes, in   
right hemispherectomies, the (remaining left-brain) patient “resembles   
a  
kind of language machine, a talking computer that decodes literally w  
hat is said, and gives the most immediate (but not necessarily the implicitly called for) response, a rote rejoinder insensitive to the ideas   
b  
ehind the questions, the intentions or implications of the questioner” (cited in Blakeslee, 1980, p. 141). Or indeed of the reality.

98

One of the most striking examples of single vision in our times   
is the work of Richard Dawkins. This, for instance, is how he interprets   
reality: “To a survival machine, another survival machine (which is not   
its own child or another close relative) is a part of its environment, like   
a rock or a river or a lump of food. It is something that gets in the way,   
or 

99

is that of course Dawkins has to see the nature of being (of the body, of   
non-left hemisphere reality) this way: this is what experience looks like   
to an information processor, which is also, of course, how he under-stands his own brain. So again we have the predictable appearance   
of machines, parts, and building blocks, and a purely functionalist or   
manipulative way of interpreting things. As Blake commented two   
hundred years ago, “A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees”:   
“The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the Eyes of others only   
a Green thing that stands in the way. Some See Nature all Ridicule &   
Deformity & by these I shall not regulate my proportions, & Some   
Scarce see Nature at all” (MHH 5, p. 35; Letter to Trusler, 23 August   
1799, p. 702). But actually to see a tree with the eyes of imagination,

99

and to experience that perception as real rather than as subjective,

Note: does this not contradict everything you just said

99

is, he   
noted, “incomprehensible/To the Vegetated Mortal Eye’s perverted &   
single vision” (J 53:10–11, p. 202). Blake railed against this dying of the   
imaginative light because so much of reality was becoming lost in sin-gle vision. And this, as he also saw, has important consequences not   
o  
nly for the development of “bad science”, but for how each individual human life is diminished by such myopia. To see a tree as a functional   
entity, or a survival machine, is to see pitifully little of it.

As McGilchrist more properly notes, the   
mode of attention favoured by science “can be undeniably useful”, but   
this “does not make it truer or more real”. Blake believed that not only   
would science be strengthened by recognising this, it would actually   
be liberated. But in the meantime we are left with the rather one-eyed,   
cyclopean commentators such as Pascal Boyer, Nicholas Humphrey,   
and Richard Dawkins, with their “lumbering robots” and building-block science. The imaginative paucity of this project, as well as its   
i  
ntellectual fatuousness, was famously challenged by Blake in one of h  
is most memorable images:W  
hat it will be Questiond When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innu-m

Contemporary commentators such as Boyer, Humphrey, and Dawkins,   
whilst providing effective critiques of theistic systems of belief, sel-d  
om apply these critiques to their own materialistic systems of belief. Thus, for example, Lewis-Williams and Pearce argue that “religion   
is, ultimately, embedded in neurology, as is pre-scientific cosmology”   
(Lewis-Williams & Pearce, 2005, p. 285). But in what is scientific   
cosmology embedded then, if not also neurology? Similarly Pascal   
Boyer argues that “the explanation for religious beliefs and behaviours   
i  
s to be found in the way all human minds work”, and by “minds” of course he means the brain—“the bits that control body machinery”   
(Boyer, 2001, p. 3). What these commentators never ask though is what   
the neurological basis is of their own belief in materialism. What are   
the neurological foundations of their need to believe in reason and   
mechanical models? As McGilchrist points out in a cogent critique of   
m  
aterialistic faith:Karl Vogt proclaimed that thought, the secretion of the brain, could   
be changed, like other bodily secretions, by diet: ‘since belief is only   
a property of the body’s atoms, a change in beliefs depends only on   
the way in which the atoms of the body are substituted’. He seems   
n  
ot to have noticed that this applies to the belief in materialism, too. [M&E,

Note: thoughts are not made of atoms, they’re made of thought!

103

“He seems not to have noticed that this applies to the belief in mate-rialism, too.” This is a striking and formidable rule to apply to all   
critiques of systems of beliefs. Perhaps Vogt’s belief in materialism,   
like Scrooge’s ghosts, may have been the result of an undigested bit of   
beef or a fragment of an underdone potato. The rather equine argument   
that 

104

ideological construct, involving loaded epistemological terms such as   
“matter”, subject and object, and the employment of a whole raft of met-a  
phors such as those of the machine and the building block: one can put men into space according to any number of such ideological systems.   
There are, moreover—as Sheldrake has recently pointed out—many   
instances where materialism signally does not “work”, or works only in   
very limited contexts (see for example his chapter ‘Is Mechanistic Medi-cine the Only Kind that Really Works’, in Sheldrake, 2012, pp. 260–290).   
I  
n a salient point McGilchrist notes that “one cannot believe in nothing and thus avoid belief altogether, simply because one cannot have n  
o disposition towards the world, that being in itself a disposition. Some   
people choose to believe in materialism; they act “as if” such a philoso-phy were true” (M&E,

By identifying the figure of Urizen with both the rationalistic, law-making programmer of post-Newtonian science and   
the abstracting and ordering deity of orthodox religion, Blake challenges the assumptions   
and metaphysical infrastructure employed by both, apparently   
opposite, systems of thought. He questions the historical and psycho-logical character of the God of state religion, and equally undermines

105

the sacrosanct dogmas of the recently institutionalised and state-spon-sored scientific project. But if both orthodoxies derive from this shared   
Urizenic base, rooted in the neural networks of the left hemisphere   
(“Where Urizen & all his Hosts hang their immortal lamps”) then   
why isn’t this more obvious? Why has there been so much conflict not   
only between religion and science but between different religions, and   
indeed between different scientific approaches and methodologies   
(Catholic versus Protestant, Einstein versus Bohr). And why do reli-g  
ious people tend not to experience their worship as rational? In his o  
wn day Blake used the metaphor of mills and machinery to convey the s  
ystemic, self-enclosed, (self-perpetuating), and rationalising activities of Urizen. Perhaps a more modern analogy would be a computer, and   
i  
n the following chapter I use this model, so endemic to contemporary scientific discourse, to explain this apparent contradiction.

In the following discussion I refer to the earlier, and more apparently   
“religious” operating system of Urizen as “R1” (“Religion”), whilst “R2”   
w  
ill denote the post-Enlightenment or updated version (“Reason”). As we have seen, Blake does not recognise or uphold this popular myth   
of their opposition. In his poem Jerusalem   
he draws our attention to the deep links between the two through Urizen’s remarkable declaration:   
“I am God O Sons of Men! I am your Rational Power!” (J   
54:15, p. 203). Urizen’s emergence and deification amongst many cultures as the pow-erful, ordering, dividing “God” of popular religion is similarly alluded   
t  
o by Blake as “The Net of Religion” which Urizenic consciousness casts over the brains of men (Ur 25:22, p. 82). Thus, according to Blake’s cog-nitive schemata, the God of the orthodox churches (R1) has historically   
been portrayed as an abstract and abstracting figure, imposing order   
o  
nto a supposedly chaotic universe, dividing day and night, good and bad, establishing rigid moral codes, imposing laws (both on “nature”   
and the society), generating the concept of abstract linear time (from the   
creation to the apocalypse), establishing a coherent, ordered universe in   
which, as Blake puts it “the passive who obey Reason” are deemed “reli-gious” and holy and acceptable to this Urizenic model of God. All of   
these ways of thinking about and interpreting the world are, as the first

107

The early “R1” religions (such as the belief structures of Judaic,   
Mithraic, Nordic, Vedic, Druid, neo-Platonic, Apollonian, Egyptian,   
and post-Constantine Christian culture) established a remarkably   
coherent, ordered picture of the cosmos in the evolving human con-s  
ciousness, and have given subsequent generations a formidable and, in many respects, still highly useful framework within which to operate   
a  
nd to understand certain aspects of existence. Most of these systems of thought have deified a powerful, ordering power or principle, one usu-a  
lly linked with “light” (i.e., rational or “enlightened” consciousness), the creator and maintainer of order, laws, and natural equilibrium in the   
cosmos. In other words they have provided the initial mainframe for   
m  
odern consciousness, which can be seen as a later “updated” version, although one which similarly relies on the notions of law, order, coher-ence, binary systems, and linear time. Within R1 itself though there were   
clearly many variants, many different sects and disputes both between   
and amongst religions and creeds (perhaps such as Windows and   
Linux which offer rather different modes of accessing the main operat-ing system), but historically, in terms of the major cultures, established

108

87

108

churches, and religions, there has been a remarkable convergence of   
outlook. Indeed, this convergence, as we have seen, has led many mod-ern commentators such as Lewis-Williams, Dawkins, and Humphrey to   
argue for their common neurological source.

108

But by the seventeenth century a more rigorous, more quantifiable,   
and above all more user-friendly methodology was emerging. Such   
a  
n update was needed not only for the sake of intellectual consistency but also as a result of the requirements of increasingly powerful new   
mercantile, industrial, and financial interests who, as Jacob, Golinski,   
Cohen, and others have shown, were to become the sponsors for this   
new mechanical and functionalist project for science (Cohen, 1980;   
Golinski 1992; Jacob, 1976). Utilisation and the desire for power were to   
b  
e key to the new scientific enterprise. “Knowledge is Power” became the brand slogan for this enterprise, providing a useful trademark   
d  
eclaration for the main aims and marketing strategy of the new R2 enterprise. The saying, widely attributed to Bacon, brilliantly encapsu-lated the left hemisphere’s program for the modern era and succinctly   
set out the agenda for the R2 programmers. In the development of R2   
as the modern successor to R1 perhaps no one encapsulates this shift—  
or the nature of the competition and the distinctions between the rival

Galileo and the Church: Between a rock and a hard place

108

Many people today believe that Galileo was put on trial by the Church   
for suggesting that the earth moves round the sun. But this, as Profes-sor Brian Cox might say, is completely wrong. It is a sign of the reach   
a  
nd potency of the homogenous dogmas of contemporary science that its hagiographic presentation of Galileo as science’s first martyr, suffer-ing for defending the “truth” against a backward Church, is so widely   
accepted and so routinely trundled out. Michael White, a recent biogra-pher of Galileo, captures and extends this canonising trend within mod-ern science in his representation of Galileo as “a symbol of the struggle   
for freedom of thought, the epitome of the enlightened individual fac-ing down institutionalised ignorance, and winning.” According to this   
version of events, Galileo’s is “a story in which our hero was defeated   
by the power of the Church but has been proven right posthumously”   
(White, 2007, pp. xiv–xv). This is certainly a story, but unfortunately it   
is not history.

109

109

It was not the hypothesis that the earth moves round the sun that   
was the problem. Copernicus had suggested this and provided a model,   
seventy-three years before Galileo, to which the Church raised no objec-t  
ion (ibid., p. 153). Galileo was put on trial not for changing the position o  
f the earth but for changing the position of hypotheses. He asserted that the scientific model of the heliocentric universe was not a scien-tific model, but the “literal” truth. As a matter of interest, Galileo also   
affirmed that the sun was the centre not merely of our solar system but   
of the whole universe, a “literal” truth that is today widely thought to   
be incorrect. Similarly he seems to have been mistaken in his belief that   
the tides were caused by the movement of the earth—something else   
he thought was objectively true, rather than just a useful hypothesis.   
As White observes, Galileo was in fact incorrect on several points (ibid.,   
p. 249, p. 251). However, this did not stop him from maintaining that   
the heliocentric model of the universe was not merely a hypothesis but   
actually true, and in this he forged a new position for both literalism   
and science. In his dispute with the Church, Galileo became even more   
dogmatic and literalist in his view of the universe than was his opposi-t

109

In 1632 Pope Urban VIII created a Special Committee of Inquiry to   
investigate the precise nature of Galileo’s work: “we think that Galileo   
may have overstepped his instructions by asserting absolutely the   
Earth’s motion and the Sun’s immobility, thus deviating from hypoth-e  
sis” (cited in White, p. 186). This Special Committee of Inquiry was an extension (or ideological arm) of the Inquisition and provided much   
of the evidence later used against Galileo. Interestingly, this body still   
exists today, although since 1965 it goes by the slightly more user-friendly name of “Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith”   
and was headed by Cardinal Ratzinger until his election to Pope in 2005   
(ibid., pp. xiii–xiv). So was Galileo right to deviate from hypothesis?   
In some respects, four hundred years later, we are still trying to answer   
the question raised by that Committee.

It evidently suits the interests of the architects and proponents of   
the current R2 system to rewrite scientific history in order to portray   
Galileo as a rational martyr at the mercy of an intransigent, backward,   
and they would probably say “stupid” Church. In the Urizenic words   
of Steven Weinberg: “one of the great achievements of science has been,   
if not to make it impossible for intelligent people to be religious, then   
at least to make it possible for them not to be religious” (cited in White,   
2007, p. xv). Such commentators seem blissfully unaware of how they   
resemble their presumed opponents in this. The figure of Galileo might   
more usefully be seen in this context as an effective advertisement for   
the new programming, recasting history in order to sell a product or in   
this case to rebrand science as the home of (Urizenic, left-brain) intel-lectual and moral superiority: with Galileo the heroic Defender of the   
Reason, battling the evil dragon of the Church. But it is hard to see in   
his story a “martyr”. Nor was he anti-religious. His dispute with the   
Church is certainly not one which he would have understood as a clash   
between reason and religion, or logic versus the Church. “I render infi-nite thanks to God,” he declared in 1609, “for being so kind as to make   
m  
e alone the first observer of marvels kept hidden in obscurity for all previous centuries” (cited in Sobel, 1999, p. 6). It is hard to doubt the   
sincerity of this statement, which reveals both his faith in God and his   
own curiously egocentric nature: “to make me alone the first observer”;   
even when ostensibly thanking God he cannot refrain from drawing   
attention to his own role. But what his statement also discloses is the   
nature of his belief in God and the particular sort of God he believed in:   
it was a God of reason, in particular a God of Mathematics. His was a   
r  
ational universe, made by a rational God, and observable by a rational mind. “It is written in mathematical language,” Galileo affirmed, “and   
the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, with-out whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word,   
and without which one wanders in vain in a dark labyrinth” (from Dia-logue,  
1632, cited in White, 2007, p. 182). Mathematics was the rational revelation of this secret language of God. If Galileo’s “rationality”   
coincided with his belief in God—in his “reason”—this also presents   
problems for those later “rationalists” seeking to make some hard dis-tinction between faith and science, R1 and R2. Equally problematic for   
their “martyr” hypothesis is the role of the Church in the dispute with

111

Galileo. It might be a shock for many modern readers to discover that   
the Church had frequently and publicly supported Galileo’s scientific   
researches. As McGilchrist remarks,  
One might think that odd in view of, for example, the received ver-sion of Galileo’s dispute with the Church—a piece of hagiography   
t  
hat suits the dogma of our own age, that Galileo must have been the champion of reason in the face of irrational bigotry on the part   
of the Church. In fact his ideas were certainly not dismissed by   
either the pope or his cardinals, who indeed let him know that they   
admired his work; and, if it had not been for Galileo’s personality,   
he would not have found himself placed under house arrest, which   
led to his canonisation in the chronicles of science. [M&E,

111

M  
cGilchrist’s observation is particularly acute in its use of terminology usually more commonly deployed by scientists and rationalists against   
the Church in order to describe this curious rewriting of history, a sort   
of intellectual precession perhaps. Note for example the subtle and   
effective references to hagiography, dogma, canonisation,—referring   
not to the appearances of religion but to the “received version” of   
today’s purportedly secular and enlightened interpretation. This shift   
towards an increasingly dogmatic and literalist understanding of rea-son and science is key to understanding the shift from R1 to R2 that   
was occurring during this time: not so much a change from religion to   
secular, rational Enlightenment (another hagiographic, self-canonising   
m  
ove by the Holy Reasoning Power of the left brain), but rather a hardening and rewiring of the earlier rationalising processes. Indeed,   
as McGilchrist suggests, both Pope Paul V and his successor, Urban   
VII, had been admirers of Galileo’s work. Galileo had met Pope Paul in   
Rome in 1611, where the Pope had given his blessing to the telescope   
and Galileo’s discoveries. As Galileo excitedly recounted it in a letter   
the next day, “His Holiness would not let me say a word kneeling but   
i  
mmediately commanded me to stand up” (cited in White, 2007, p. 125, p. 124). Paul V’s successor, Urban VIII, famous now for being the Pope   
presiding over Galileo’s trial, had also been both a friend and advocate   
of Galileo. In 1623 Galileo was welcomed to the Vatican, and Galileo was   
immensely flattered by this attention, as of course he would have been,   
writing back proudly that the Pope “bore me the greatest goodwill”,   
something which he clearly felt was intended honourably and sincerely

112

(  
cited in White, p. 169, p. 158). The new pope saw the Copernican theory as “an interesting notion that might lead to some practical benefits” and   
was noticeably less keen than his predecessors to suppress the opinions   
o  
f Copernicus’s supporters. “Urban could claim with honesty that he had never felt comfortable with the enthusiasm with which the Inquisi-t  
ion had muzzled science,” since he had publically objected to the 1616 verdict when he was Cardinal Barberini (ibid., p. 170). Indeed the two   
men shared much in common, both being adherents of a rather dog-matic and literalist interpretation of the universe, with a mutual belief   
in the powerful and ordering, rational God who had made it.

112

91

112

Galileo’s arrest and punishment by the Catholic Church, brutal and   
unnecessary as it was, was not therefore primarily about his defence   
of heliocentrism but rather about a clash of operating systems. And at   
the centre of this dispute was not the status or position of the sun, but   
the status or position of hypotheses. Galileo is a particularly interest-ing figure in this discussion as he both embodies and illustrates the   
s  
hift between R1 and R2. R1 rationality had always maintained that its models and hypotheses concerning the universe were only that: highly   
useful, beautifully constructed maps or models of reality that enabled   
their users to do many extraordinary and practical things. They were   
considered as provisional, useful, and historically embedded. This all   
changed with Galileo, who was perhaps the first scientist to declare that   
his metaphors were literally true.

112

The repercussions of the dispute between the Church and Galileo   
can be felt to this day. In 1990 a declaration by the then Cardinal   
R  
atzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) concluded: “At the time of Galileo the Church remained much more faithful to reason than Galileo him-self. The process against Galileo was reasonable and just” (cited in   
White, p. 246). Whilst anyone who has read the final transcript of the   
I  
nquisition (given in White almost in full, op cit., pp. 218–224) must challenge both the reasonableness and justness of the latter (the process  
was anything but reasonable, unless by reasonable one means authori-tarian, manipulative, and based on the need for power and control),   
Ratzinger does have a point regarding the status of rationality and   
hypotheses. His statement also suggests that the Vatican itself is con-cerned with “reason”—it still sees itself as defender of the Reason, the   
Holy Logic and the Holy Logos. Ratzinger’s statement reveals the fas-c  
inating insight, one that powerfully supports Blake’s contention of the Urizenic nature of both religion and science, that being “faithful to

113

reason”, as Ratzinger so illuminatingly puts it, was—and is—a cardinal   
concern for the Holy Roman Church.

113

the appeal of   
m  
athematics, as Burtt adds, was that its conclusions seemed to such men as Galileo to be “absolutely true and necessary, not at all depend-e  
nt on human judgment” (ibid., p. 75). This is a curious statement, if one decodes it. It sets up as opposites “absolutely true and necessary”   
on the one hand, and “human judgment” on the other. The implication   
is that to be human is to be hopelessly untrue and unnecessary. Blake   
deconstructed the stance of Newtonian science as implying exactly this:   
it is a stance which aspires to the status of machinery, to the non-hu-man. More than that, it covertly wants to erase or sever humanity from   
i  
ts science, just as it wants to turn the body into a machine. Of course t  
his is in some ways a curious want, as mathematics is one of the most artificially contrived systems ever constructed, and therefore in some   
ways the most human. Galileo might claim that the book of Nature “is   
written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles,   
circles, and other geometrical figures” (ibid., p. 75), but this language is   
also one that is always only retrospectively read back into nature. This   
i  
s why Blake constantly emphasises how much this science is based n  
ot on immediate knowledge of the world but rather on “memory”: mathematics for him is a retrospective language, laboriously worked   
out behi

114

a  
t the world. He explicitly contrasted “mathematic form” with “living f  
orm”: “Mathematic Form is Eternal in the Reasoning Memory”, he noted. “Living Form is Eternal Existence”. And to underline the vital   
difference between the rational or Platonic and the spiritual or imagina-tive he added, “Grecian is Mathematic Form. Gothic is Living Form”   
(On Virgil, p. 270). For Galileo though, these ratios of memory were   
the Divine Wisdom. And the less alive something was, the more it resem-bled God. “As to the truth, of which mathematical demonstrations give   
us the knowledge, it is the same which the Divine Wisdom knoweth;   
but … the manner whereby God knoweth the infinite propositions,   
whereof we understand some few, is highly more excellent than ours,   
which proceedeth by ratiocination, and passeth from conclusion to   
conclusion, whereas his is done at a single thought or intuition” (cited   
in Burtt, 1924, p. 82). Note that the “Divine Wisdom” here again points   
to the Logos, the “High Church” end of left-hemispheric worship.

114

93

114

Blake angrily wrote   
in his copy of Reynolds: “God forbid that truth should be Confined to   
Mathematical Demonstration!” (Laoc, p. 274; On Reynolds, p. 659). And   
in his wonderful and atypical prose satire, An Island in the Moon,  
Blake has some fun satirising this sort of figure, spoofing “the Mathemati-cian” as “Obtuse Angle”, who always understands better “when he   
shuts his eyes” (IslM, p. 450).

114

The real clash was not, for Blake, between   
religion and reason, which he regarded as similar systems competing   
for whose God was more internally consistent, abstract, and inhuman   
than the other, but between rationality and imagination.

114

Galileo’s   
mathematical and geometrical studies were not distinct from his   
“religious” beliefs: since geometry was the word (or at least the Platonic   
form) of God, to study the mathematical universe was an inherently

115

religious pursuit, a revelation of the “Divine Wisdom”. Galileo shared   
this view of the nature and underlying programs of the universe with   
t  
he Pope. Indeed Pope Urban VIII encouraged Galileo to write a book on the subject, a work that is known as the Dialogue Concerning the Two   
Chief World Systems.  
These two chief world “systems” in some ways encapsulate the shift from R1 to R2. And this “dialogue” has been going   
on ever since, with Richard Dawkins as perhaps its best-known con-t  
emporary mouthpiece—cast either as Galileo, if one believes him to be a champion of free, critical, and enlightened thinking, or else as the   
Pope, if one regards him as a pontificating and a close-minded adherent   
of only one way of understanding reality.

115

the evidence of the senses is margin-alised and replaced by the purportedly absolute certainties of math-ematics and geometry. This is really at the heart of Blake’s objection to   
t  
he systems of “Rational Philosophy and Mathematic Demonstration” (J 58: 13, p. 207): they remove the human perceiver from perception.   
N  
ot only is the post-Newtonian system based on abstract and invisible p  
rinciples and entities rather than the evidence of the senses, but it is also a system that constantly prioritises repetition and generalisation

[J

Newton’s methodology works in the wrong direction, by claiming   
that the more you remove yourself from actual, real, particular expe-riences—the more you generalise—the truer things are; but also on a

116

psychological level, this drive towards the purity and abstraction of   
“Mathematic Demonstration” is essentially, Blake points out, a bloodless   
and rather sexless drive. Truth, for Blake, comes with and through the   
body, through the interconnections and participation with particular   
living, breathing forms of being. It does not depend on lines of math-ematics and QEDs. It depends on engagement, not on “Virginity”.   
(Perhaps it is no coincidence that Newton himself was apparently a vir-gin, though whether Blake was aware of this is not known). But Blake’s   
p  
oint concerns the fundamentally dehumanising and cold, purifying stance of the Urizenic brain: as we saw in Part I, the left hemisphere is   
profoundly anti body, anti sense. This antipathy towards the body, and   
the reality of the immediate senses, is historically true both of traditional   
religions and of Newtonian and Galilean science. It is these tensions   
between the claims of the body (empiricism) and the claims of the left- hemispheric mind (“pure reason”) that Galileo’s story also highlights.   
The Church’s problem with Galileo lay not only in his presentation of   
the heliocentric universe as a literal—one might say “Gospel”—truth   
r  
ather than a hypothesis, but also with the lack of empirical evidence supporting his hypothesis. This lack of contemporary empirical proof   
for the heliocentric universe has been explored by Burtt, who asks the   
fundamental, and provocative, question: “Why did Copernicus and   
Kepler, in advance of any empirical confirmation of the new hypothesis   
that the earth is a planet revolving on its axis and circling round the sun,   
while the fixed stars remain at rest, believe it to be a true picture of the   
astronomical universe?” (Burtt, 1924, p.36). This question is provoca-t  
ive because the new sciences—the new Reason (R2)—was supposed, retrospectively at least, to have been based on empiricism (rather than   
belief). So, Burtt asks, why did these scientists defend the new hypoth-esis “in advance of any empirical confirmation”? As he points out,   
t  
he existing Ptolemaic method accounted for the phenomena with “as great accuracy” as its new rival: “The motions of the heavenly bodies   
could be charted according to Ptolemy just as correctly as according   
to Copernicus” (ibid., p. 36). Copernicus had reduced the number of   
epicycles from the eighty of the Ptolemaic system to only thirty-four,   
b  
ut this seemed to be the only major advantage of the new theory—not something you would risk being burned at the stake for perhaps.

116

T  
he lack of empirical evidence for the heliocentric universe in Galileo’s day is significant in understanding the reasons for the appeal   
of the theory. In this feature of the dispute we can see again the antith-

117

esis between reason and the body. Reason has always distrusted and   
disliked the senses. In Plato’s day, this was conveyed by portraying the   
b  
ody as a prison (for the rational soul); in Pope Urban VIII’s day by the demonisation of the body as a sinful, lustful, and unholy charnel. And   
today it is shown by the attempt to portray the body as a machine, infor-mation processor, or computer. This assault on the body is particularly   
evident in the story of Galileo. As we have seen, for him the universe is   
not written in the language of the senses, but in “triangles, circles, and   
other geometrical figures.” For him, the evidence of the senses might   
be used, but only selectively, and they are more usually considered to   
be unreliable and deceptive: according to the senses, after all, the sun   
appeared to move around the earth. Indeed this, for Galileo, was one   
o  
f the appeals of the Copernican system: it was, as Burtt notes, “the supreme example of the victory of mathematical reason over the senses.”   
As Galileo himself observed, or, perhaps I should say, reasoned:  
I cannot sufficiently admire the eminence of those men’s wits, that   
have received and held it to be true, and with the sprightliness of   
their judgments offered such violence to their own senses, as that   
they have been able to prefer that which their reason dictated to   
them, to that which sensible experiments represented most mani-festly to the contrary … I cannot find any bounds for my admira-tion, how that reason was able in Aristarchus and Copernicus, to   
commit such a rape on their senses, as in despite thereof to make   
herself mistress of their credulity. [Galileo, Two Great Systems,  
cited i  
n Burtt, 1924, p. 79]“That reason was able … to commit such a rape on their senses”: this is   
very much the Galilean spirit and project, and in this he is clearly and   
demonstrably continuing the historical Urizenic drive of the left hemi-sphere. Galileo’s admiration for scientists’ ability to commit “violence   
t  
o their own senses”, and to upturn and invert “sensible experiments” themselves, shows the appeal that the dogmatic certainties and abstrac-t  
ions of mathematical and geometrical science (the basis of mechanics) h

From R1 to R2: The new scientific priesthood

Galileo Galilei, as one of the architects of the new R2 operating sys-tem of the left brain, introduced a more internally coherent and con-sistent rationality, made it even more literalistic and mathematical in   
nature, changed the status of scientific models from being metaphors   
and useful hypotheses into being statements of absolute “truth”, and   
helped to introduce a new tone into the scientific project: intellectually

120

superior, dogmatic, intolerant of alternative modes of knowledge and   
a  
ttention, and sanctimonious. Many of these innovative applications were unfortunately merely refinements and continuations of the medi-eval Church’s default operating system: dogmatic, literalist, and uncon-s  
ciou

This   
h  
istorical development was to alter the character of both science and religion: science became increasingly more like a religion (dogmatic,   
pontificating, and literalist), and theism became increasingly rational-i  
stic (philosophical and naturalistic) in a rather desperate attempt not to appear too redundant and obsolete. This latter trend culminated in   
the mechanical deism of the eighteenth century, which repelled Blake   
so much. The newly invigorated scientific investigators of the nine-teenth century took all of the absurdly literal, fundamentalist, and   
pedestrian statements and beliefs of the traditional orthodox Church   
at face value—creation in seven literal days, actual virgin births, and so   
on—and declared, unsurprisingly enough, that they could not be taken   
as objectively true. This literalist “critique” of an even more literalist   
Church seemed to many nineteenth-century scientists to be radical.

model, such defenders of the scientific faith as Boyer, Humphrey, and   
Dawkins, take evident glee in exercising this essentially “religious”   
neurological or judgmental and sanctimonious program. As we saw in   
Part I, one of the most recognisable features of Urizenic programming   
is its desperate superiority complex: its compulsive need to feel supe-rior, to gain power, to brook no other ways of seeing or interpreting.   
This drive for moral and intellectual superiority—traditionally a preoc-cupation with priests—became, increasingly, a defining characteristic   
of post-Newtonian science. “There is no point in disputing someone,”   
wrote Galileo, “who is so ignorant that it would require a huge vol-ume to refute his stupidities.” And in a self-admiringly reflective pas-sage he informed Cosimo de’ Medici that “of all the hatreds, none is   
greater than that of ignorance against knowledge” (White, 2007, p. 133,   
p. 156). This is not quite true: the hatred of supposed “illuminated” peo-ple against supposed ignorant people seems to be greater. Like many   
apparently “enlightened” thinkers, Galileo believed that most humans   
were stupid. He thoroughly disliked teaching for similar reasons, as   
White observes: “teaching novices was something he could barely tol-erate and his distaste for the profession increased as he grew older”   
(  
ibid., p. 74). This elitist and self-admiring concept of intelligence was to remain with science. Blake brilliantly satirises this profoundly unem-p  
athic aspect of science (what today might be diagnosed as a rather autistic tendency) in the character of “Obtuse Angle” in A  
n Island in the Moon, who regards every one as a “fool”, especially if they fail to obey   
the most basic and literal rules of logic: “Pray said Aradobo is Chatter-ton a Mathematician. No said Obtuse Angle how <can you> be so fool-ish as to think so. Oh I did not think he was I only askd said Aradobo.   
How could you think he was not, & ask if he was said Obtuse Angle”   
(IslM p. 453).

121

The implicit, although it seems almost entirely unconscious, nature   
of this superiority complex is prevalent within much popular sci-entific discourse. The rational deconstruction of arguments for the

122

existence of God in such modern works as Dawkins’ T  
he God Delusion and Boyer’s Religion Explained—their titles are indicative of the sledge-hammer approach—suggests the adversarial nature of this rivalry   
between competing versions of the same Urizenic program. Typical   
section titles in Boyer’s work are: “How the supernatural can be tested   
in the lab”, “Rituals are indeed meaningless”, and “Religion is less than   
you think” (subtlety was never a very strong point for the left brain).

122

Equally typical is Nicholas Humphrey’s manipulative and rather con-descending mode of analysis in Soul Searching, a book that seeks to   
explain “why so many people still cling, like children seeking reassur-ance, to belief in supernatural forces.” Given his own need to uphold   
the childish certainties of science, this accusation is ultimately again   
rather self-reflexive. He claims that his interpretation of the infantile   
basis of religious faith is not disparaging—he says he does it “certainly   
with no intention to disparage. There is no shame in people having   
childlike needs nor in their seeking familiar childish ways of satis-fying them”, a position, if it is intended sincerely, that is rather hard   
to maintain given his subsequent references to religious beliefs and   
practices as similar to “theatrical farce” and “psychological illusion   
or human deceitfulness”. Or indeed to his comparisons of Jesus and   
Moses as being like Houdini and Uri Geller, or his supposition that   
“Jesus was regularly using deception and trickery in his public per-formances like any common conjuror” (Humphrey, 1995, p.12, p. 73,   
p. 70, p. 62, p. 99).

Boyer’s discussion is different in so far as he accepts that there may   
i  
n fact have been a rational basis for many early systems of belief and religions. Thus in surveying, as he puts it, “the rich tapestry of human   
folly” that is religion, he explores the possible contending grounds for   
belief in God (as if they were features on a car to be sold to the masses)   
a  
nd notes that these claims to belief must in fact be of a specific kind to warrant popular adoption. “The sleep of reason is no explanation for   
religion as it is. There are many possible unsupported claims and only   
a few religious themes.” Not any old unsupported claim will do, appar-ently, even for the religious. For example, one possible criterion for a   
belief in a God, he says, might be the following proposition: “There is   
only one God! He is omnipotent. But He exists only on Wednesdays”   
(Boyer, 2001, p. 2, p. 35, pp. 59–60). This, he notes, has some features   
going for it but as a general proposition it is not immediately compel-l  
ing. Why is this, he asks? This question, I think, is the key one—and also one that Boyer curiously seems to have difficulty answering. He   
admits that some propositions or contenders for belief seem to be, as   
he puts it, “better” or “worse” than others: “They may be bad in dif-ferent ways”, while some “new propositions sound much better”. This   
is still tautological though: why are they better? Well, he conjectures,   
certain propositions seem “strange” or “surprising”, and some might   
be more “workable” than others, and so on (ibid., p. 64). What he really   
means to say, of course, is that these claims and propositions would   
not be rational. That’s the reason why God existing only on Wednes-days is a “bad” proposition. It did not become a widely accepted tenet   
of any religion because it was not rational: there must be reasons to   
believe in God, and these reasons must conform to some degree to   
p  
eople’s experience of life—to evidence, to empiricism—or else to an ideological state apparatus (ISA). Boyer himself seems curiously una-ble or reluctant to see this—for him religion must be an intuitive   
thing (this is perhaps one of the “childlike needs” or assumptions of mod-ern science), so he puts the rational rejection for possible theistic beliefs

124

d  
own to “intuitive feelings” about some claims for God being somehow “better” than others. Boyer however notices that what makes religious   
propositions plausible or not is often to do with things like “ontologi-cal categories” (i.e., concerning classification, ordering, and syllogistic   
reasoning) and “inference systems”. “Our inference systems may be   
there because they provide solutions to problems that were recurrent   
in normal human environments for hundreds of thousands of years”   
(ibid., p. 112, pp. 132–33). Isn’t this a rational thing? To develop infer-ence systems that provide “solutions to problems”? Isn’t this, indeed,   
w

124

REASON   

124

The process of apparently primitive and religious accumu-lated inference, as he also notes, constantly involves reconstitution,   
d  
eduction, and evaluation (ibid., pp. 132–133, 135). This might suggest a  
t least a rational element to these supposedly childlike and intuitive religions. As Nicholas Humphrey has similarly observed, there must   
be an “explanatory principle” in religions, providing “a reasonable   
explanation of the present” (Humphrey, 1995, p. 16). Thus, the puzzling   
l  
ongevity and hold of such “supernatural belief systems”, it turns out, has to do with their “reasonableness”, their “logical connections”, and   
their syllogistic and inferential structures. This seems to be another   
case of the pot calling the kettle the perfect absorber of light. Similarly,   
a tenth of Dawkins’ book, The God Delusion, is taken up with reviewing   
a whole series of apparently rational “Arguments for God’s existence”.   
He examines a priori arguments, a posteriori arguments; he explores   
the ontological, cosmological, and teleological arguments, the argu-ments of Aquinas, Newton, Pascal—without ever seeming to notice the   
accumulated evidence he has just provided for an immense amount   
of rationalising going on within the apparently irrational Church, and   
indeed within western thought throughout the last two thousand years.   
Surely this suggests, if anything, a striking preoccupation in all previ-ous monastic and theological circles with argument, disputation, aca-d  
emic distinctions, laws, divisions, moral codifications—indeed with all of the Urizenic left hemisphere concerns that, as Blake pointed out,   
have formed the basis of the Holy Reasoning Power’s world picture.   
Dawkins points out the limitations of Aquinas’s postulation of an   
U  
nmoved Mover and Uncaused Cause, which the scholastic theologian had advanced in order to try and explain the rational conundrum of   
what caused causation. But all Aquinas had done was to identify a   
problem with the R1 operating system.

The emotional and comforting nature of religion

125

By exposing the Urizenic nature of human thought-construction,   
including both the earlier religious and later scientific systems, Blake   
suggests their common roots within the structure of rationalising   
processes within the human brain. But the history of religion, as of   
reason, is not simply the development of inference systems, logical   
syllogisms, a posteriori arguments, and evaluative deduction. Urizenic   
systems are powerful because they appeal to and draw on other aspects   
of human experience. The modern adherents of R2, such as Dawkins,   
Boyer and Humphrey, point to two particular aspects of R1 which they   
claim clearly distinguishes their own methodology and science from   
the “religious” project of their predecessors.

125

Firstly, they claim that religion has an emotional, comforting aspect to   
it, and that this therefore might help explain its otherwise baffling and   
unlikely longevity, given the far superior operating speeds and func-tional parameters of R2. For Humphrey, the appeal of religion is that   
it offers “reassurance”: that the belief in souls and in God makes one   
feel “less lonely and more cared for” (Humphrey, 1995, p. 62). Indeed   
this has become something of a doctrinal cliché: religion is somehow   
all about beliefs, and things you can’t prove, and feelings, and stands   
for comfort; whereas science is all about being objective, and hard, and   
empirical, and wearing white coats.

126

REASON   

126

As Blake astutely countered, it is actually belief in Reason and “the   
Law” that many people have found so comforting about “religious   
worship”—the passive who obey Reason. Traditional religions offered   
not so much comfort, as certainty and potential security (if one obeyed).   
This deep need for certainty also drove Galileo—as we have seen—and   
many other “left-brain” scientists and philosophers, such as Descartes   
and Locke. According to this view, the real secret of the immensely pow-erful hold of R1 for so long was its cogent and coherent portrayal of a   
highly disciplined, ordered universe, controlled by an unswerving and   
objective set of Laws, usually embodied in some sort of personalised   
or personified Lawmaker. (“I AM GOD, AND KING, AND LAW!”, as   
Shelley summed up this continuing piece of ISA in The Mask of Anarchy,  
Reiman & Powers, 1977, p. 302). It is these laws which stabilise the Urizenic   
operating system, and produce the basis—the “rock”—for its believers:   
the illusion of certainty and solidity that provides the comfort for belief   
both in science and in religion. Thus Urizen declares, in a statement that   
is almost a declaration of the fundamental program of the Urizenic OS   
(ordering, quantifiable, uniform, systematic, and hierarchical):  
L  
o! I unfold my darkness: and onThis rock, place with strong hand the Book  
O  
f eternal brass, written in my solitude ….One command, one joy, one desire,  
One curse, one weight, one measure  
One King, One God, one Law.  
[Ur 

127

This was and is, I believe, the source of its “comfort”: early Urizenic   
religious codes (R1) provided a clear and fairly logical set of rules and   
prescriptions to be followed, and an abstract and invisible Law-maker   
to enforce them. And this is perhaps also the main, if rarely stated,   
p  
sych

127

This brings us to the second response to Humphrey’s point that a key   
difference between religion and science is that only religion provides   
comfort. The search for grand unified theories, supersymmetry, under-lying mathematical harmony, and, above all, order,  
still drives much of contemporary physics. This is not merely an intellectual preoccupation   
or an aesthetic imperative, as Einstein famously intimated; it is a pro-foundly emotional and deep-seated psychological need within scien-t  
ists (as the later discussion on autistic ways of thinking also suggests). And R2 excels in this area: it offers its certainties, its belief in an even   
more rigorously controlled and deterministic universe than R1—its   
absolute “laws” which not even God can alter—its utter predictability,   
its rather simplistic materialistic credo (as articulated, as we have seen,   
by Dawkins, Humphrey, Boyer et al.). And it has even removed the fear   
of the afterlife from its picture. Its users are offered the reassurance that   
w  
hatever they do in this lifetime will have no consequence in the next. If anything is comforting, it is surely this.

127

The second critique of “religion” by the modern scientific proponents   
of R2 is that not only is it supposed to be a reassuring credo but it is   
a  
lso a system based on the supernatural, the intuitive, and the irrational rather than on the hard-nosed logical, empirical, and demonstrable   
methodology of reason. But this again fails to understand the nature   
of Urizenic reasoning. Reason may be rational, but the belief in reason   
is not. And it is a belief: and beliefs are not rational. It is this aspect of   
reason-worship that has been so misunderstood and enlarged upon by   
the “religious”, and so vilified by their more literalist R2 opponents.   
A  
s McGilchrist has noted:There is one problem that attacks the very root of logos.  
Although constitutive for science and much of philosophy, because of its   
being based on argumentation and the provision of proof, it cannot   
constitute—cannot ground—itself according to its own principles

of proof and argumentation. The value of rationality, as well as   
whatever premises it may start from, has to be intuited: neither   
can be derived from rationality itself. All rationality can do is to   
provide internal consistency once the system is up and running.   
[M&E,  
p. 330]R2, like all rational programs, provides a useful operating system once   
it is “up and running”, but it cannot look beneath its own feet. It can-n  
ot do this—will not do this—because it has nothing to stand upon. Archimedean scientists have been looking for a place to stand since the   
scientific world began, and the further they look, the more the ground   
itself seems to be involved in how they are looking at it. In fact it requires   
f  
aith to believe in anything, as we shall see later in a discussion on the ontological status of fiction and belief. If one regards “God” as Reason,
