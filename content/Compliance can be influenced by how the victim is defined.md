## Compliance can be influenced by how the victim is defined

[Compliance can be influence to the degree that the victim is abstract](Compliance%20can%20be%20influence%20to%20the%20degree%20that%20the%20victim%20is%20abstract.md), and predictably, [compliance]() is also decreased when the victim is individuated. However, don’t let the authority individuate victims for you. In one classic Milgram-esque study, the scientists would “accidentally” allow a teacher to overhear their opinion of the learner. “Seems like a nice guy” versus “This guy seems like an animal.” Guess who’d get more shocks?

Authorities rarely ask us to administer shocks to those whom they label as nice guys. It’s always to the animals. Implicit in the latter categorization’s evoking more compliance is our having ceded power to the authorities or to the group to create the narrative. One of the greatest wellsprings of resistance is to seize back the narrative. From “children of exceptionalities” to the Paralympics, from gay-pride marches to “never again,” from Hispanic Heritage Month to James Brown singing, “Say It Out Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud,” a major step toward victims’ resistance is to gain the power to define themselves.
