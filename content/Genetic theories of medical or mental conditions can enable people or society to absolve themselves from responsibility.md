## Genetic theories of medical or mental conditions can enable people or society to absolve themselves from responsibility # 

But If [[gene expression is highly contingent on the environment]], then why are narrow [[gene]]tic assumptions so widely accepted and, in particular, so enthusiastically embraced by the media? Well, [[the more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]], so absolute [[gene]]tic laws would absolve us of responsibility and guilt. If [[gene]]tics ruled our fate, we would not need to blame ourselves or anyone else. [[Gene]]tic explanations get us off the hook. The possibility does not occur to us that we can accept or assign responsibility without taking on the useless baggage of guilt or blame. 

More daunting for those who hope for scientific and social progress, the [[gene]]tic argument is easily used to justify all kinds of inequalities and injustices that are otherwise hard to defend. It serves a deeply conservative function: if stuff like [[addiction]] or mental illness is determined mostly by biological heredity, we are spared from having to look at how our social environment supports, or does not support, the parents of young children and at how social attitudes, prejudices, and policies burden, stress, and exclude certain segments of the population and thereby increase their propensity for mental illness and [[addiction]]. It is thus an example, i believe, of how [[The left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]]. I also see a devitalization of the [[right hemisphere]], as [[the right hemisphere sees things in their context]], and as a result [[the right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes]].

[[Gene]]s are an explanation for the way things are that does not threaten the current order of society. Why should someone feel unhappy or engage in antisocial behavior when that person is living in the freest and most prosperous nation on earth? It can‚Äôt be the system! There must be a flaw in the wiring somewhere. Succumbing to the common human urge to absolve ourselves of responsibility, our culture has too avidly embraced [[gene]]tic [[fundamentalism]]. That leaves us far less empowered to deal either actively or proactively with mental illness, [[addiction]], and disease. We ignore the good news that nothing is irrevocably dictated by our [[gene]]s and that, therefore, there is much we can do.
