## Basal ganglia # 

![[Pasted image 20231201124435.png|400]]

The basal ganglia are a group of [[subcortical nuclei]] situated at the base of the [[forebrain]] and top of the [[midbrain]]. Basal ganglia are strongly interconnected with the [[cerebral cortex]], [[thalamus]], and [[brainstem]], as well as several other [[brain]] areas. The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of functions, including control of voluntary motor movements, [[procedural learning]], [[habit formation]], [[conditioning]], and others. 

The main components of the basal ganglia‚Äîas defined functionally‚Äîare the [[dorsal stratum]] ([[caudate nucleus]] and [[putamen]])and the [[ventral striatum]] ([[nucleus accumbens]] and [[olfactory tubercle]]) [[globus pallidus]], [[ventral pallidum]], [[substantia nigra]], and the [[subthalamic nucleus]]. Each of these components has a complex internal anatomical and neurochemical organization. The largest component, the striatum (dorsal and ventral), receives input from many brain areas beyond the basal ganglia, but only sends output to other components of the basal ganglia. The globus pallidus receives input from the striatum, and sends inhibitory output to a number of motor-related areas. The [[substantia nigra]] is the source of the striatal input of the¬†[[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]], which plays an important role in basal ganglia function. The [[subthalamic nucleus]] receives input mainly from the striatum and [[cerebral cortex]] and projects to the [[globus pallidus]].

Popular theories implicate the basal ganglia primarily in action selection‚Äîin helping to decide which of several possible behaviors to execute at any given time. In more specific terms, the basal ganglia's primary function is likely to control and regulate activities of the motor and premotor cortical areas so that voluntary movements can be performed smoothly. It also plays a role in attention, acting as a sort of automatic transmission, subconsciously shifting attentional resources as the [[cortex]] demands. Experimental studies show that the basal ganglia exert an inhibitory influence on a number of motor systems, and that a release of this inhibition permits a motor system to become active. The "behavior switching" that takes place within the basal ganglia is influenced by signals from many parts of the brain, including the [[prefrontal cortex]].1 It has also been hypothesized that the basal ganglia are not only responsible for motor action selection, but also for the selection of more cognitive actions. This is because [[thinking is the evolutionary internalization of physical movement]].

The basal ganglia have a [[Limbic system|limbic]] sector which includes the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[ventral pallidum]], and [[ventral tegmental area]]. There is considerable evidence that this limbic part plays a central role in [[operant conditioning]] as well as cognition and [[frontal lobe]] functioning, via the [[mesolimbic pathway]] from the [[ventral tegmental area]] to the [[nucleus accumbens]] that uses the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]]. A number of highly addictive drugs, including [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], and [[nicotine]], are thought to work by increasing the efficacy of this [[dopamine]] signal.

When faced with a tiger suddenly springing from the bushes, what should you do? Stand still, run to climb a tree, or make a dash for the river and hope the tiger can‚Äôt swim? The movement program chosen at this point might determine whether you get to pass your [[gene]]s along to any offspring. Since movements are most effective when well learned or [[habit]]ual, the basal ganglia are also very involved in [[habit formation]]. It is possible that this is mostly the case for the left basal ganglia, as [[novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]]. Certain [[habit]]s appear to be formed through the interplay between two distinct basal ganglia pathways. One of these pathways is¬†_associative_. It consciously collects information needed for reaching goals such as staying warm, finding food, finding a mate, and expressing oneself artistically. A second pathway is more¬†_automatic_. This route takes those lessons learned from the first pathway and includes them in a repertoire of stored [[habit]]s. These [[habit]]s are then available to be called upon, when [[operant conditioning|cued]] by a given situation.

[[Habits develop to help the brain conserve energy]]. Being involved in [[habits]], the basal ganglia also assists in energy conservation in regards to learned behaviors. As we learn a behavior, our mental activity decreases. As the behavior becomes more and more automatic, we start thinking less and less. When we first started learning the behavior, our [[brain]] had to work at full power to make sense of all the new information. After a few days of performing the same behavior, we no longer have to think about it, and so the [[prefrontal cortex]] and the [[task-positive network]] go quiet.  When a behavior is first learned, it requires a major dose of concentration. Eventually we can perform that task with hardly any thought. The routine occurs by [[habit]]. Once that [[habit]] starts unfolding, our [[default mode network]] is free to mindwander. We can perform [[habit]]s even while the rest of the [[brain]] goes to sleep.
