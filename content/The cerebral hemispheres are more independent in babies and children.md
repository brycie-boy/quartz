## The cerebral hemispheres are more independent in babies and children  #🧠 

Independent functioning of the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s is one of the achievements of maturity: children are, relatively speaking, split-[[brain]] subjects, with less interhemispheric independence. Babies and young children are less reliant on the [[corpus callosum]]: callosal [[myelin]]ation does not even begin until the end of the first year of life, and progresses only slowly thereafter. Pre-adolescent children find it relatively difficult to use their hemispheres separately, which is still further evidence of the inhibitory role played by the [[corpus callosum]] in adults. Interhemispheric connectivity grows during childhood and adolescence, with the result that the hemispheres become more independent.
