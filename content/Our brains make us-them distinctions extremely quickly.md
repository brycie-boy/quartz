## Our brains make us-them distinctions extremely quickly

Our [brain](Brain.md)s form [In-group and out-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) dichotomies with stunning speed. Fifty-millisecond exposure to the face of someone of another race activates the [amygdala](Amygdala.md), while failing to activate the fusiform face area as much as same-race faces do—all within a few hundred milliseconds. Similarly, the [brain](Brain.md) groups faces by gender or social status at roughly the same speed.

Rapid, automatic biases against a [out-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) can be demonstrated with the fiendishly clever Implicit Association Test. Suppose you are unconsciously prejudiced against trolls. To simplify the IAT enormously: A computer screen flashes either pictures of humans or trolls or words with positive connotations (e.g., “honest”) or negative ones (“deceitful”). Sometimes the rule is “If you see a human or a positive term, press the red button; if it’s a troll or a negative term, press the blue button.” And sometimes it’s “Human or negative term, press red; troll or positive term, press blue.” Because of your anti-troll bias, pairing a troll with a positive term, or a human with a negative, is discordant and slightly distracting. Thus you pause for a few milliseconds before pressing a button.
