## The Flow can help prevent the cognitive burden of starting a writing project with a blank page

A naive writing process begins with a rough inkling about what one wants to write and a blank page. Progress from this point requires an enormous amount of activation energy and cognitive effort: there’s nothing external, so you must juggle all of the piece-to-be in your head. This is in stark contrast with [non-forcing](Non-forcing.md) and thus incompatible with [☯️ The Flow](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Flow.md). By contrast, if you’ve already written lots of concept-oriented [☀️ Main-Sequence Note](Main-Sequence%20Note)s around the topic (as you would using [☯️ The Flow](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Flow.md)), your task is more like editing than composition. You can make an outline by shuffling the note titles, write notes on any missing material, and edit them together into a narrative. 

In fact, because you can [create speculative outlines while writing notes](Create%20speculative%20outlines%20while%20writing%20notes.md), you might find that the first of these steps are already accomplished, too. And writing each note is not hard: [Main-Sequence Notes permit a smooth incremental progress in writing](Main-Sequence%20Notes%20permit%20a%20smooth%20incremental%20progress%20in%20writing.md). Instead of having a task like “write an outline of the first chapter,” you have a task like “find notes which seem relevant.” Each step feels doable.
