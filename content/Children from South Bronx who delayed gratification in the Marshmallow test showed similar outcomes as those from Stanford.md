## Children from South Bronx who delayed gratification in the Marshmallow test showed similar outcomes as those from Stanford # 

[[Preschoolers who previously delayed gratification in the marshmallow test showed better outcomes in delaying gratification and in life|Preschoolers]] and [[adults who could delay gratification in the marshmallow test as children showed better outcomes in delaying gratification and in life]]. But perhaps these findings were a fluke, limited to what had been happening at Stanford, in the 1960s and early 1970s in California, at the height of the counterculture and the Vietnam War. In order to test this, [[Walter Mischel]] and his students launched a number of other studies with very different cohorts‚Äînot from the privileged Stanford campus community, but from very different populations and eras, including the public schools of the South Bronx in New York City decades after the Stanford studies had begun. And we found that things played out in similar ways with children living in extremely different settings and circumstances
