## People cling to their beliefs to avoid having to deal with doubt and uncertainty

[The finite models of the universe that we cling to lead us to discard the infinity of existential reality](The%20finite%20models%20of%20the%20universe%20that%20we%20cling%20to%20lead%20us%20to%20discard%20the%20infinity%20of%20existential%20reality.md). The reason why it is usually so easy for human beings to become hypnotized by their [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md)s is because we have a tendency to drift into certainty and dogma rather than having to deal with doubt or [cognitive dissonance](Cognitive%20dissonance.md). Coping with the nuances of contradictory ideas or experiences is mentally stressful. It requires energy and effort to sit with all the seemingly opposite things that all seem true. We slip into such certainties all the time, but especially when existential concerns are stressful: [we only rush to certitude when time pressure or prejudice is involved](We%20only%20rush%20to%20certitude%20when%20time%20pressure%20or%20prejudice%20is%20involved.md). Every "real" universe is easy to understand because it is much simpler than the existential continuum. Being hypnotized by our [emic reality](Emic%20Reality.md), we become more and more detached from the existential continuum, and are annoyed when it interferes with us. "Real" universes make us puny, however, because they are governed by absolute laws and we‚Äôre small compared to them. [The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world](The%20more%20certain%20of%20our%20views%20we%20become,%20the%20more%20we%20perceive%20ourselves%20to%20be%20victims%20of%20an%20impersonal%20world.md).
