## In evolution, entropy increases in non-living systems, and negentropy increases in living-systems

Evolution is always a matter of at least two [stochastic process](Stochastic%20process.md)es, each one acting as “selector” of the other(s). That is, in non-living systems, where no such “selection” is involved, [entropy](Entropy.md) steadily increases, as stated in the famous Second Law of Thermodynamics. In living systems, due to stochastic co-selection, [negentropy](Negentropy.md) steadily increases. In [Schrodinger]()’s phrase, “Life feeds on negative entropy.” Life is an ordering, selecting, coherence-making process. This process accelerates because it is [logarithmic](Logarithm.md).
