## In evolution, entropy increases in non-living systems, and negentropy increases in living-systems   # 

Evolution is always a matter of at least two [[stochastic process]]es, each one acting as “selector” of the other(s). That is, in non-living systems, where no such “selection” is involved, [[entropy]] steadily increases, as stated in the famous Second Law of Thermodynamics. In living systems, due to stochastic co-selection, [[negentropy]] steadily increases. In [[Erwin Schrodinger|Schrodinger]]’s phrase, “Life feeds on negative entropy.” Life is an ordering, selecting, coherence-making process. This process accelerates because it is [[Logarithm|logarithmic]].
