Suppose that I become dissatisfied with my habitual self, or feel that there are areas of experience or self-understanding which IÂ cannot reach. One way of exploring these is to remove myself fromÂ present surroundings and see what emerges. This is not without itsÂ dangers. Any form of new organization or integration within the mindÂ has to be preceded by some degree of disorganization. No one canÂ tell, until he has experienced it, whether or not this necessaryÂ disruption of former patterns will be succeeded by something better.
