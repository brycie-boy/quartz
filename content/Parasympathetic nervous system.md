## Parasympathetic nervous system

The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)is a wing of the [autonomic nervous system](Autonomic%20nervous%20system.md) which conserves energy in thr body and is responsible for ongoing, steady-state activity. It produces a feeling of relaxation, often with a sense of contentment—this is why it’s sometimes called the “rest-and-digest” system, in contrast to the “fight-or-flight” [sympathetic nervous system](Sympathetic%20nervous%20system.md). Parasympathetic activation is the normal resting state of your body and brain. These two wings of the ANS are connected like a seesaw: when one goes up, the other one goes down. Exhalation has also been shown to activate the parasympathetic nervous system.
