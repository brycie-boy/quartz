## The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world

[If our capacity to impose order onto experience becomes overbearing, it may narrow cognition](If%20our%20capacity%20to%20impose%20order%20onto%20experience%20becomes%20overbearing,%20it%20may%20narrow%20cognition.md). The acceleration of violent, inexplicable, and seemingly "pointless" crimes committed by [Right Men](The%20Right%20Man.md) in this century‚Äîand their hideous magnification into mass murders and war crimes by [Right Men](The%20Right%20Man.md) in governments‚Äîindicates the prevalence of the self-hypnosis in our [Emic Reality](Emic%20Reality.md)s and what [Alfred van Vogt]() calls the "inner horror" that accompanies it. This "inner horror" is a sense of total helplessness combined with a certainty of always being right. It seems paradoxical, but the more totally right a person becomes, the more helpless they also become. 

This is because being right means "knowing" and "knowing" means completely understanding the "real" universe. Since the "real" universe is, by definition, "objective" and "outside of us" and not our creation (contra [The reality that we observe is being co-created by our minds](The%20reality%20that%20we%20observe%20is%20being%20co-created%20by%20our%20minds.md)), we are made puny by it. We cannot act, but only re-act. As the "real" universe pushes us, we push back. But it is bigger, so we will lose eventually. Our only defense, then, is in being right and fighting as dirty as possible. Where [Fundamentalism](Fundamentalism.md) reigns, and where the "real" universe, this shadow of violence and horror follows its wake.
