## Excessive cortisol release has been shown to down-regulate serotonin-1a receptors #üß†

[Cortisol spikes are accompanied by increased dopamine levels in the brain](Cortisol%20spikes%20are%20accompanied%20by%20increased%20dopamine%20levels%20in%20the%20brain.md). [Dopamine](Dopamine.md) nerve terminals reside in the [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md) and are ideally kept in check. But [stress causes the HPA axis to quite the prefrontal cortex by flooding it with dopamine and cortisol](Stress%20causes%20the%20HPA%20axis%20to%20quite%20the%20prefrontal%20cortex%20by%20flooding%20it%20with%20dopamine%20and%20cortisol.md), which increases risky and impulsive behavior, and keeping your [cortisol](Cortisol.md) elevated. As you might expect, [cortisol](Cortisol.md) is the anti-contentment hormone. Contentment means all is well and it‚Äôs OK to chill. If the [adrenal gland]()s are releasing [cortisol](Cortisol.md), something must be wrong: Female monkeys, like humans, form social hierarchies. Some are pretty impervious to stress, so no big surprise that they are at the top of the social totem pole. Those who are more subordinate, who have to scramble for food and status, have a more stressful life. And their [serotonin](Serotonin.md) gets shot down too. They have fewer serotonin-1a receptors in the [dorsal raphe nucleus](). Indeed, stress and [cortisol](Cortisol.md) are the mortal enemies of the [serotonin-1a receptor](Serotonin-1a%20receptor.md), and cause down-regulation throughout most species.
