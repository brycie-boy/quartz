## Excessive cortisol release has been shown to down-regulate serotonin-1a receptors #üß† 

[[Dopamine]] nerve terminals reside in the [[prefrontal cortex]] and are ideally kept in check. But [[stress causes the amygdala and HPA axis to quite the prefrontal cortex by flooding it with dopamine and cortisol]], which increases risky and impulsive behavior, and keeps your [[cortisol]] elevated. As you might expect, [[cortisol]] is the anti-contentment hormone. Contentment means all is well and it‚Äôs OK to chill. If the [[adrenal gland]]s are releasing [[cortisol]], something must be wrong: Stress and [[cortisol]] are the mortal enemies of the [[serotonin-1a receptor]], and cause down-regulation throughout most species.
