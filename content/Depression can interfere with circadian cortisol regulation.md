## Depression can interfere with circadian cortisol regulation # 

[[Depression|Depressed]] people have problems with circadian [[cortisol]] regulation. Normally, [[cortisol]] goes up in the morning before you wake up to help you mobilize [[glucose]], raise your [[blood pressure]], and get ready for the day. By the time nighttime arrives, [[cortisol]] levels are in the sewer. This [[circadian rhythm]] of [[cortisol]] is missing in [[Depression|depressed]] subjects: their [[cortisol]] is always up and you can‚Äôt even suppress it with medications.
