## Politicians can use surveillence data to discriminate as away to sell canidates for political decisions # 

Unique harms can arise from the use of surveillence data in politics. Election politics is very much a kind of marketing, and poltiticians are starting to utilize the capabilities of the fact that [[data mining and personalized algorithms create an online experience that is increasingly tailored to our interests]] to dicriminate as away to track voting patterns and better sell a canidate for political decision. Canidates can create ads and fund-raising appeals targeted to patilcular categories: people who earn a certain income, gun owners, people who have read knews articles on one side of a paticular issue, unemployed veterans, etc. They can target outraged ads to one group of people, and thoughtful policy based ads to another. They can also fine-tune their get-out-the-vote campaigns on Election day, and more effectively gerrymander disctrics between elections.
