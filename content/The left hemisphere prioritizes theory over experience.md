## The left hemisphere prioritizes theory over experience # 

[[The left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]]. Because its thinking is decontextualized, the [[left hemisphere]] tends towards a slavish following of the internal logic of the situation, even if it runs completely contrary of everything experience tells us. This can be a strength, for example in philosophy, when it gets us beyond intuition, although it could also be seen as the disease for which philosophy itself must be the cure; but it is a weakness when it permits too ready a capitulation to theory. [[The experienced world transcends the deterministic views of the fundamentalist]].
