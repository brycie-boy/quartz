## Ketone

Ketones are energy molecules produced through the breakdown of [fat]() in the [liver](). Ketones are produced do to the fact that while most of our body can run on [fat]() for fuel, the [brain](Brain.md) cannot. However, the [liver]() does not possess the necessary enzymes to use ketones for fuel, so they are shuttled out of the [liver]() and into the blood, where they are able to travel to [cell]()s and [tissue]()s and be taken in and used for energy. Many [cell]()s in the body will skip using ketones for fuel and use [fat]() instead, allowing the ketones in the bloodstream to be taken in and used by the [brain](Brain.md).
