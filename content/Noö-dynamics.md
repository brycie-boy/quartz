## Noö-dynamics

[Mental health is based on a tension between what one is now and what one should become](Mental%20health%20is%20based%20on%20a%20tension%20between%20what%20one%20is%20now%20and%20what%20one%20should%20become.md). Noö-dynamics is the term [Frankl]() used to refer to as the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it.
