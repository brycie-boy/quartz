## Attention to the great elements  #⏳ 

Attention to [[the great elements]], a meditation subject of the [[contemplation of body]], is expllained below per the Buddha:

> a monk reviews this same body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this body there are [[the earth element]], [[the water element]], [[the fire element]], and [[the air element]].’ ... Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces; so too, a monk reviews this same body.
