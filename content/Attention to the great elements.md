## Attention to the great elements  #⏳

Attention to [the great elements](The%20great%20elements.md), a meditation subject of the [contemplation of body](Contemplation%20of%20body.md), is expllained below per the Buddha:

 > 
 > a monk reviews this same body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this body there are [the earth element](The%20earth%20element.md), [the water element](The%20water%20element.md), [the fire element](The%20fire%20element.md), and [the air element](The%20air%20element.md).’ ... Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads with it cut up into pieces; so too, a monk reviews this same body.
