## Around the 1960s, cognitive psychologists became dissatisfied with behaviorism for understanding learning and started focusing more on thought

By the 1960s, many psychologists were frustrated with the limits of [behaviorism](). It seemed like an overly simplistic way to understand complex human beings. Along came people like [\[Jean Piaget]() and [Lev Vygotsky](), who were interested in how people thought, not just how they behaved. [Behaviorism]() argues that humans learn in response to environmental stimuli; cognitive psychologists acknowledged that, in between the environment and behavior, there was a thinking human being.
