## Deductive reasoning

Deductive [reason](Reason.md)ing is the mental process of drawing deductive [inference](Inference.md)s. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its [premise](Premise.md)s, i.e. it is impossible for the [premise](Premise.md)s to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises "all men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man" to the conclusion "Socrates is mortal." is deductively valid.
