## Addiction only occurs in people who already have a predisposition for it

if drugs by themselves could cause [addiction](Addiction.md), we would not be safe offering narcotics to anyone. Medical evidence has repeatedly shown that [opioid]()s prescribed for [cancer]() pain, even for long periods of time, do not lead to [addiction](Addiction.md) except in a minority of susceptible people.

An article in the Canadian Journal of Medicine in 2006 reviewed international research covering over six thousand people who had received [narcotic]()s for chronic pain that was not [cancer]()ous in origin. There was no significant risk of [addiction](Addiction.md), a finding common to all studies that examine the relationship between [addiction](Addiction.md) and the use of [narcotic]()s for pain relief. "Doubts or concerns about [opioid]() efficacy, toxicity, tolerance, and abuse or [addiction](Addiction.md) should no longer be used to justify withholding [opioid]()s," concluded a large study of patients with chronic pain due to rheumatic disease.

We can never understand [addiction](Addiction.md) if we look for its sources exclusively in the actions of chemicals, no matter how powerful they are. [Addiction](Addiction.md) is a human problem that resides in people, not in the drug or in the drug‚Äôs capacity to produce physical effects. It is true that some people will become hooked on substances after only a few times of using, with potentially tragic consequences, but to understand why, we have to know what about those individuals makes them vulnerable to [addiction](Addiction.md). Mere exposure to a [stimulant]() or [narcotic]() or to any other mood-altering chemical does not make a person susceptible. If they become an addict, it‚Äôs because they're already at risk.
