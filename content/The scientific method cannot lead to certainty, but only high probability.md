## The scientific method cannot lead to certainty, but only high probability #🧠 

While the [[scientific method]] is powerfully effective for establishing truth, and seems to most of us the best method yet devised by mankind, it is made up of two elements that are fallible. The [[scientific method]] is a mixture of sense data with the old Greek [[pure reason]]. However, [[because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential]], and [[things that philosophers thought they knew through pure reason often ended up being wrong]]. Scientific generalizations which have lasted a long time have _high probability_, perhaps the highest probability of any generalizations, but it is only [[Idolatry]] which claims none of them will ever again have to be revised or rejected.
