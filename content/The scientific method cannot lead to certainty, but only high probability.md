## The scientific method cannot lead to certainty, but only high probability #üß†

While the [scientific method](Scientific%20method.md) is powerfully effective for establishing truth, and seems to most of us the best method yet devised by mankind, it is made up of two elements that are fallible. The [scientific method](Scientific%20method.md) is a mixture of sense data with the old Greek [pure reason](Pure%20Reason.md). However, [because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential](Because%20perception%20is%20not%20absolute,%20all%20of%20our%20ideas%20are%20somewhat%20conjectural%20and%20inferential.md), and [things that philosophers thought they knew through pure reason often ended up being wrong](Things%20that%20philosophers%20thought%20they%20knew%20through%20pure%20reason%20often%20ended%20up%20being%20wrong.md). Scientific generalizations which have lasted a long time have *high probability*, perhaps the highest probability of any generalizations, but it is only [Idolatry](Idolatry.md) which claims none of them will ever again have to be revised or rejected.
