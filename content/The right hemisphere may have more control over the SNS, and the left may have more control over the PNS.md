## The right hemisphere may have more control over the SNS, and the left may have more control over the PNS  # 

There is some evidence that, whereas control of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] is more influenced by the [[right hemisphere]], control of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] is more under [[left hemisphere]] control. Of the two, the [[sympathetic nervous system]] is more important for modulating heart rate and blood pressure in response to emotion. It is also more involved with response to the new, the uncertain, and the emotionally demanding, the special domains of the vigilant [[right hemisphere]], whereas the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] produces relaxation of autonomic function, appropriate to the familiar, the known and the emotionally more neutral, the special domains of the [[left hemisphere]]. But release of the [[left hemisphere]] can certainly increase activity inappropriately, and will be associated with sympathetic activity. Perhaps the safest conclusion is that this area remains unclear.
