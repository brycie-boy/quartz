## The second stage of perception #🧠 

The second stage of perception (see [[the first stage of perception]]) involves the activity of the sense organ after being impressed by part of the energy that reaches said organ. Note that not all of the energy is absorbed by the sense organ even in extreme cases, like when we are hit by a hammer, we still do not absorb all of the energy of the hammer. Even at this stage—even if nothing was required for further perception—we would still be dealing with part, not all; we would be dealing with abstraction, uncertainty, and fallibility. The transition from stage two to [[The third stage of perception|stage three]] involves part of what happens after the sense organ is stimulated by part of the energy flowing to us from the space-time event. This period consists of very, very many signals traveling to many parts of our organism.
