## Conceptual understanding  #‚è≥ 

Conceptual understanding is the correct understanding of a concept arrived by study and examination of that concept in depth. Such understanding is by no means dry and sterile. When rooted in a faith in the worth of the concept and a strong determination to understand it, it serves the germ from which [[experiential understanding]] evolves. Conceptual understanding is the understanding of the [[left hemisphere ]], as [[The left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]] and [[the left hemisphere prioritizes theory over experience]].
