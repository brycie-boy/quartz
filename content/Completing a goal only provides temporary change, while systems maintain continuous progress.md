## Completing a goal only provides temporary change, while systems maintain continuous progress  # 

One reason to [[focus on systems instead of goals]] is that achieving a goal is only a momentary change. Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room‚Äîfor now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat [[habit]]s that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you‚Äôll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You‚Äôre left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That‚Äôs the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
