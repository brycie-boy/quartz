## Internal-External Locus of Control Scale

The standard measure of sense of control is a questionnaire called the Internal-External [Locus of Control](Locus%20of%20control.md) Scale, developed by psychologist [Julien Rotter]() in the late 1950s. The questionnaire consists of twenty-three pairs of statements. One statement in each pair represents belief in an internal [locus of control](Locus%20of%20control.md) (control by the person) and the other represents belief in an external [locus of control](Locus%20of%20control.md) (control by circumstances outside of the person). For each pair, the person taking the test must decide which of the two statements is truer. One pair, for example, is the following: (a) I have found that what is going to happen will happen. (b) Trusting to fate has never turned out as well for me as making a decision to take a definite course of action. In this case, choice (a) represents an external [locus of control](Locus%20of%20control.md) and (b) represents an internal [locus of control](Locus%20of%20control.md).
