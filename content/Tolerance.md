## Tolerance  #üß†

To protect itself from [excitotoxicity](Excitotoxicity.md), [cell]()s have developed a plan B that is semi-protective. [Ligands]() almost uniformly down-regulate their own [receptor](Receptor.md)s when overstimulated, all over the body. In other words, the locks can be rekeyed or even shut down. But it also means that the response of the [cell]() won‚Äôt be as robust the next time around. You will therefor need more stimulation of your [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s to get less reward. This down-regulation of [receptor](Receptor.md)s is a phenomenon called tolerance; the receiving [neuron](Neuron.md) is becoming tolerant to the excessive stimulus. This is both good and bad. It‚Äôs good because it means your [neuron](Neuron.md)s aren‚Äôt dead. It‚Äôs bad in that the next time you go [pleasure](Pleasure.md) seeking, you‚Äôre going to need more stimulation in order to get the same level of reward.
