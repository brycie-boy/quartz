## Tolerance  #🧠 

Tolerance refers to the process in which cells down-regulate their [[receptor]]s when they’re overstimulated. It is a mechanism developed by [[cell]]s in order to protect themselves against [[excitotoxicity]]. It also means, however, that the response of the [[cell]] won’t be as strong the next time around, and you will therefor need more stimulation to get the same effect.
