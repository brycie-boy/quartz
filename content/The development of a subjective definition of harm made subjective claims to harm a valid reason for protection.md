## The development of a subjective definition of harm made subjective claims to harm a valid reason for protection # 

[[By the 2000s, the concept of trauma in psychiatry had expanded to include subjective harm]]. At that point, It was not for anyone else to decide what counted as trauma, bullying, or abuse; if it felt like that to you, trust your feelings. If a person reported that an event was traumatic (or bullying or abusive), their subjective assessment was increasingly taken as sufficient evidence. And if a rapidly growing number of students have been diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]], then there is a rapidly growing need for the campus community to protect them.
