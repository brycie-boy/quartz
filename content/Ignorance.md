## Ignorance  #‚è≥

* I believe this is probably "blindess" and "deafness" that is being cured by Jesus in the Bible

In Buddhism, Ignorance indicates an unawareness of [the four nobel truths](The%20four%20nobel%20truths.md). Sentient beings wander through [Samsara](Samsara.md) becuase they have not understood and penetrated [the four nobel truths](The%20four%20nobel%20truths.md). As [the twelve links of Dependent Origination](The%20twelve%20links%20of%20Dependent%20Origination.md) show, what lies at the base of the causal genesis of dissatisfaction is ignorance. Those who fail to understand [the four nobel truths](The%20four%20nobel%20truths.md) generate [volitional formation](Volitional%20formation.md)s which lead to future [rebirth](Rebirth.md). The antidote to ignorance is wisdom, which is accordingly defined as knowledge of [the four nobel truths](The%20four%20nobel%20truths.md).
