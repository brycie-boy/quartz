##  Ignorance  #⏳ 

-  I believe this is probably "blindess" and "deafness" that is being cured by Jesus in the Bible

In Buddhism, Ignorance indicates an unawareness of [[the four nobel truths]]. Sentient beings wander through [[Samsara]] becuase they have not understood and penetrated [[the four nobel truths]]. As [[the twelve links of Dependent Origination]] show, what lies at the base of the causal genesis of dissatisfaction is ignorance. Those who fail to understand [[the four nobel truths]] generate [[volitional formation]]s which lead to future [[rebirth]]. The antidote to ignorance is wisdom, which is accordingly defined as knowledge of [[the four nobel truths]].
