## BDNF is necessary for LTP to be able to occur

[BDNF](BDNF.md) Is important not merely for the survival of [neuron](Neuron.md)s but also for their growth (sprouting new [dendrite](Dendrite.md) branches) and thus for learning. [Eero Castr√©n](), as well as [Susan Patterson]() from Kandel‚Äôs lab at Columbia, found that if you stimulate [LTP](LTP.md) in mice by making them learn, [BDNF](BDNF.md) levels increase. Looking inside their [brain](Brain.md)s, researchers determined that mice without [BDNF](BDNF.md) lose their capacity for [LTP](LTP.md); conversely, injecting [BDNF](BDNF.md) directly into the brains of rats encouraged [LTP](LTP.md). Then one of [Carl Cotman]()‚Äôs former postdoctoral students, neurosurgeon [Fernando Gomez-Pinilla](), showed that if you neutralize [BDNF](BDNF.md) in mice, they are slow to find their way out of a pool having a hidden platform. 

in a 2007 study of humans, German researchers found that people learn vocabulary words 20 percent faster following exercise than they did before exercise. [exercise has been shown to raise levels of BDNF](Exercise%20has%20been%20shown%20to%20raise%20levels%20of%20BDNF.md), and that the rate of learning correlated directly with levels of [BDNF](BDNF.md). Along with that, people with a [gene]() variation that robs them of [BDNF](BDNF.md) are more likely to have learning deficiencies.
