## BDNF is necessary for LTP to be able to occur  # 

[[BDNF]] Is important not merely for the survival of [[neuron]]s but also for their growth (sprouting new [[dendrite]] branches) and thus for learning. [[Eero Castr√©n]], as well as [[Susan Patterson]] from Kandel‚Äôs lab at Columbia, found that if you stimulate [[LTP]] in mice by making them learn, [[BDNF]] levels increase. Looking inside their [[brain]]s, researchers determined that mice without [[BDNF]] lose their capacity for [[LTP]]; conversely, injecting [[BDNF]] directly into the brains of rats encouraged [[LTP]]. Then one of [[Carl Cotman]]‚Äôs former postdoctoral students, neurosurgeon [[Fernando Gomez-Pinilla]], showed that if you neutralize [[BDNF]] in mice, they are slow to find their way out of a pool having a hidden platform. 

in a 2007 study of humans, German researchers found that people learn vocabulary words 20 percent faster following exercise than they did before exercise. [[exercise has been shown to raise levels of BDNF]], and that the rate of learning correlated directly with levels of [[BDNF]]. Along with that, people with a [[gene]] variation that robs them of [[BDNF]] are more likely to have learning deficiencies.
