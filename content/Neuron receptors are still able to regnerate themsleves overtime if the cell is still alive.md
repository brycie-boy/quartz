## Neuron receptors are still able to regnerate themsleves overtime if the cell is still alive

If you stop the overstimulation of the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) before your [neuron](Neuron.md)s go through [apoptosis](Apoptosis.md) ([The overstimulation of dopamine receptors may lead to cell damage or death in the nucleus accumbens](The%20overstimulation%20of%20dopamine%20receptors%20may%20lead%20to%20cell%20damage%20or%20death%20in%20the%20nucleus%20accumbens.md)), you still have a fighting chance of pulling out. If the postsynaptic [neuron](Neuron.md)s are only damaged but still alive, your [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s can regenerate over time. You can restore your [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) and start over, although [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s aren‚Äôt back to normal for 12 to 14 months of complete abstination.
