## Social role  # 

A social role is a set of connected behaviors, rights, obligations, and [[social norms]] as conceptualized by people in a social situation. Social role theory posits the following about social behavior: 

- the division of labor in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions, we call roles.
- Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behavior and actions that recur in a group, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behavior in these roles, which further explains the place of a person in the society.
- Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called actors.
- When individuals approve of a social role, they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms. 
- The anticipation of [[operant conditioning|rewards and punishments]] as well as the satisfaction of behaving pro-socially, account for why agents conform to role requirements.
