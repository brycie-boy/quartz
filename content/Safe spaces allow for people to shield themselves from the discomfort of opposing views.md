## Safe spaces allow for people to shield themselves from the discomfort of opposing views

[Some leftists try to silence apposing ideas or form safe spaces from them because they believe it may harm those who's own subjective experience is invalidated](Some%20leftists%20try%20to%20silence%20apposing%20ideas%20or%20form%20safe%20spaces%20from%20them%20because%20they%20believe%20it%20may%20harm%20those%20who's%20own%20subjective%20experience%20is%20invalidated.md). However, the threat isn't just the reactivation of painful personal memories; it is also the a threat to peoples beliefs. One college student who sought out a safe space put it rather bluntly: “I was feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that really go against my dearly and closely held beliefs.” [Every fundamentalism perpetuates itself by repetition and group reinforcement](Every%20fundamentalism%20perpetuates%20itself%20by%20repetition%20and%20group%20reinforcement.md). These safe spaces allow [fundamentalists](Fundamentalism.md) to isolate themselves into an [echo chamber](Echo%20chamber.md) in order to be shielded from views which may bring them the discomfort of [cognitive dissonance](Cognitive%20dissonance.md), which they define as "harm," since [going into the twenty-first the concept of safety had expanded from physical safety to include emotional safety](Going%20into%20the%20twenty-first%20the%20concept%20of%20safety%20had%20expanded%20from%20physical%20safety%20to%20include%20emotional%20safety.md).
