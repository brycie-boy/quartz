## Safe spaces allow for people to shield themselves from the discomfort of opposing views # 

[[Some leftists try to silence apposing ideas or form safe spaces from them because they believe it may harm those who's own subjective experience is invalidated]]. However, the threat isn't just the reactivation of painful personal memories; it is also the a threat to peoples beliefs. One college student who sought out a safe space put it rather bluntly: “I was feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that really go against my dearly and closely held beliefs.” [[Every fundamentalism perpetuates itself by repetition and group reinforcement]]. These safe spaces allow [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] to isolate themselves into an [[echo chamber]] in order to be shielded from views which may bring them the discomfort of [[cognitive dissonance]], which they define as "harm," since [[going into the twenty-first the concept of safety had expanded from physical safety to include emotional safety]].
