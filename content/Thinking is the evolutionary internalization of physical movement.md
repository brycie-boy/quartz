## Thinking is the evolutionary internalization of physical movement  # 

As our species has evolved, our physical skills have developed into abstract abilities to predict, sequence, estimate, plan, rehearse, observe ourselves, judge, correct mistakes, shift tactics, and then remember everything we did in order to survive. The [[brain]] circuits that our ancient ancestors used to start a fire are the same ones we use today to learn new words.

Starting with evidence that the trunk of [[neuron]]s connecting the [[cerebellum]] to the [[prefrontal cortex]] are proportionally thicker in humans than in monkeys, it now appears that this [[motor cortex]] also coordinates thoughts, attention, emotions, and even social skills. When we exercise, particularly if the exercise requires complex motor movement, we‚Äôre also exercising the areas of the [[brain]] involved in the full suite of cognitive functions. We‚Äôre causing the [[brain]] to fire signals along the same network of [[neuron]]s, which solidifies their connections.
