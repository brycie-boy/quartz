## The brains of abused or neglected children show reductions of the size of several brain structures # 

The [[brain]]s of mistreated children have been shown to be smaller than normal by 7 or 8 percent, with below-average volumes in multiple [[brain]] areas, including the [[prefrontal cortex]]; the [[corpus callosum]], and several structures of the [[limbic system]], whose dysfunctions greatly increase vulnerability to [[addiction]]. In a study of [[depression|depressed]] women who had been abused in childhood, the [[hippocampus]] was found to be 15 percent smaller than normal. The key factor was abuse, not [[depression]], since the same [[brain]] area was unaffected in [[depression|depressed]] women who had not been abused.
