## Right hemisphere

The right [brain hemisphere]() is responsible for broad, vigilant [lantern consciousness](Lantern%20consciousness.md), the purpose of which appears to be awareness of signals from the surroundings, especially of other creatures, who are potential predators or potential mates, foes or friends; and it is involved in bonding in social animals. Animals must be capable of open attention, as wide as possible, to guard against a possible predator. The right hemisphere seeing things whole, and in their context. The right hemisphere in birds, as in humans, is associated with detailed discrimination and with topography. The right hemisphere relies more on a ‘global’ strategy, taking account of the thing as a whole and comparing it with an ideal exemplar. The capacities that help us form bonds with others, such as empathy, emotional understanding, are the responsibility of the right hemisphere. The [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) that the right hemisphere is more reliant on is [norepinephrine](Norepinephrine.md).
