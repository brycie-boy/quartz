C  
HAPTER 1Microaggression and the Culture   
of Victimhood

27

The term microaggression has become popular only recently, and this   
was the first we had heard of it. As sociologists of morality we were imme-diately intrigued. We thought of Emile Durkheim, the nineteenth-century   
French sociologist, who famously asked his readers to imagine what would   
happen in a “society of saints.” The answer is that there would still be sin-ners because “faults which appear venial to the layman” would there create   
scandal (Durkheim 1982:100). And it did seem that people were most   
concerned about rooting out racism and bigotry in the very places where   
there was the least of it. These so-called microaggressions, many of which   
outsiders would see as no more than venial faults, were causing great scan-dal in our universities.

28

Even as campus activists and many others have embraced the concept of   
microaggression, much of the broader public has fiercely resisted it. The   
opposition arises because microaggression complaints violate many long-standing social norms, such as those encouraging people to have thick   
skin, brush off slights, and charitably interpret the intentions of others.

28

Derald Wing Sue is probably more responsible   
for the success of the microaggression program than anyone else. Sue,   
who has been called the godfather of the concept of microaggression   
(Schwartz 2016), defines microaggressions as “the brief and common-place daily verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities, whether   
intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or   
negative racial, gender, and sexual orientation, and religious slights and   
insults to the target person or group” (Sue 2010:

29

:  
275). Sue does not claim the flight attendant was lying. In fact Sue and his colleagues say the power of microaggressions “lies in their invisi-bility to the perpetrator” (Sue et al. 2007:275). “In some respects,” they   
go on to say, “people of color may find an overt and obvious racist act   
easier to handle than microaggressions that seem vague or disguised” (Sue   
et al. 2007:

30

But remember that microaggressions can be unintentional, even invis-ib

30

it does not refer to any clearly defined behavior (compare Lilienfeld 2017)  
. If it did, it would make sense to ask whether any of the alleged microag-gressions mentioned above were really microaggressions. It would also be   
possible for people to sincerely but wrongly claim to have experienced a   
microaggression or to wrongly accuse others of microaggressing. In that   
case Derald Wing Sue’s perception might be wrong and the flight atten-dant might be innocent. But Sue and others define the term in a way that   
n

31

no intent is required. Nothing determines whether the behavior—asking   
two passengers to move—is a microaggression other than Sue’s reaction.   
Sociologically, a microaggression is not a kind of statement someone   
m  
akes or a kind of behavior someone engages in; it is a label that someone else attaches to a statement or behavior. The labeling of something as a   
microaggression is thus a moralistic behavior, an act of defining right and   
wrong,

Critics of the Microaggression Program

31

P  
sychologist Kenneth Thomas concludes that Sue’s characterization of the incident “may speak more about Sue’s personal need to feel special or   
privileged than about any prejudice on the part of the flight attendant.”

32

What the critics are objecting to is that someone’s interpretation of   
another person’s action matters more than the intentions of the actor.   
Some of the statements included in the UC document might be criticized   
on these grounds as well. It is a microaggression, according to the docu-ment, to say “Where are you from?” or “Where were you born” to an   
Asian American or Latino American, “Why are you so quiet?” to an Asian,   
Latino, or Native American, or “Why do you have to be so loud/ani-mated?” to an African American. Note that what is required of people is   
not that they treat minorities or women as they would anyone else. “Why   
are you so quiet” might be asked of any quiet person of whatever race or   
ethnicity, but asking it of an Asian, Latino, or Native American is a micro-aggression, according to the document, because it conveys “the notion   
that the values and communication styles of the dominant/White culture   
are ideal/‘normal’” (University of California 2014). Whether the person   
asking the question actually means this or is even aware of any such cul-tural differences between the “dominant/White culture” and others seems   
to have no bearing on whether the question is a microaggression. Similarly,   
“Where are you from?” is a staple of small talk anywhere people do not   
know one another well, but it becomes a microaggression when asked of   
an Asian American or Latino American, according to the UC document,   
because it conveys the message “You are not a true American.”

32

That this question might be asked of anyone was illustrated recently   
during a panel discussion on microaggressions at the University of   
California, Irvine. Members of the panel had already discussed various   
examples of microaggressions when the moderator, radio talk show host   
Larry Mantle, invited questions from the audience. After calling on the   
first questioner, Mantle asked, “Where are you from?” The audience   
laughed, and though Mantle did not realize why at first, the questioner   
explained: “People are laughing because of the question. I don’t need to   
take offense at that because I’m part of the privileged majority who don’t   
constantly have to put up with questions of where I’m from” (quoted in   
Barbash 2015)  
. But she had been asked just that. The question is c

Furedi points out that for the microaggres-sion complainant, “neither the content of the words nor the intention   
behind them is important,” and he urges readers to ignore such com-plaints. “We all should be free to decide the meanings of our words,” he   
concludes.

34

One final issue in the microaggression debate stems from the fact that   
most slights and insults, whether real or imagined, are never labeled   
microaggressions. Recognizing only some of them as such privileges some   
victims over others. Opponents of affirmative action might be as offended   
as its supporters upon hearing someone disagree with them, but it is “I   
b  
elieve the most qualified person should get the job” and not “I believe e  
mployers should make ethnic diversity a goal in hiring decisions” that the University of California (2014) calls a microaggression. Likewise the   
e  
xamples suggest that only women or various minorities, such as blacks, Asians, Latinos, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) per-sons, can be victims of microaggression, though it is surely possible for   
m  
en to experience slights based on their sex or for whites to experience slights based on their ethnicity. Even some minority groups, such as   
Mormons or evangelical Christians, are notably absent from the lists of   
p

Returning to Derald Wing Sue’s example, he was clearly angry, but so   
was the flight attendant. If we are simply talking about perceived insults,   
why is the flight attendant’s behavior a microaggression but Sue’s behav-ior toward her is not? Surely suddenly having to deal with angry passen-g  
ers berating her and accusing her of racism might have been as unpleasant a  
n experience for the flight attendant as being asked to change seats to redistribute the weight on the plane was for the two professors. It also   
likely would not have happened if she were not white. And the perceived   
slights and snubs of day-to-day life are unpleasant even when they clearly   
have nothing to do with one’s group identities. According to those pro-moting the concept, though, these are not microaggressions. “There was   
a white, male elementary school teacher doing a workshop,” Sue says,   
“talking about microaggression he experienced as a white male elementary   
teacher. That’s a misapplication of the concept” (quoted in Hampson   
2016). Whether an act is a microaggression depends not only on how it is   
perceived, but also on who perceives themselves as being wronged by   
w

35

Many of the critics have noted this. “Deciding who is eligible to com-plain about microaggressions,” according to blogger and journalist Megan   
McArdle, “is itself an act by which the majority imposes its will” (McArdle   
2015). And the linguist and political commentator John McWhorter says   
that the way those calling attention to racial microaggressions tend to   
e  
mploy the concept “seems fixed so that whites can’t do anything right.” He says this creates “endless conflict, under an idea that basically being   
white is, in itself, a microaggression.” He sees this as a kind of “bullying   
disguised as progressive thought” (McWhorter 2014)

35

Critics like McWhorter see the bullying behavior more closely tied to   
the concept itself. The recent term crybully, an amalgam of crybaby   
and bully,  
points

36

Kimball, a longtime critic of the campus left, says crybullies are “a new   
academic phenomenon, at once tender and vicious,” that arises from rhet-oric about microaggressions (Kimball 2015)  
. The English writer Julie Burchill describes crybullies as “a hideous hybrid of victim and victor,   
weeper and walloper.” She says the crybully “always explains to the point   
of demanding that one agree with them and always complains to the point   
of insisting that one is persecuting them” (Burchill 2015). Lukianoff and   
Haidt’s (2015) concept of vindictive protectiveness   
is similar in that it points not only to the protectiveness of the microaggression program, as   
it seeks to shield people “from words and ideas that make some uncom-fortable,” but also to the vindictiveness, as it “seeks to punish anyone who   
interferes with that aim, even accidentally.”

Microaggression and Moral Polarization

36

The two sides of the debate over microaggressions seem to share little   
common ground. One side argues that microaggressions are “the new face   
of racism,” that they “lead to macroaggressions,” or that they harm “stu-dent performance, mental health, and worker productivity” (Watanabe   
and Song 2015)

36

Microaggression complaints arise from a culture   
of victimhood in which individuals and groups display a high sensitivity to   
slight, have a tendency to handle conflicts through complaints to authori-ties and other third parties, and seek to cultivate an image of being victims   
who deserve assistance.

A Culture of Dignity

39

Honor has not disappeared. It is still prevalent throughout the Arab world,   
a  
nd enclaves of honor exist in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western nations, including among street gangs and other groups   
of poor young men. Still, the prevailing culture in the modern West is one   
whose moral code is nearly the exact opposite of that of an honor culture.   
Rather than honor, a status based primarily on public opinion, people are   
said to have dignity, a kind of inherent worth that cannot be alienated by   
others (Berger 1970; Leung and Cohen 2011; Rosen 2012)  
. Dignity exists independently of what others think, so a culture of dignity is one in   
which public reputation is less important. Insults might provoke offense,   
b  
ut they no longer have the same impact as a way of establishing or destroying a reputation for bravery. People from dignity culture are less   
touchy (Cohen et al. 1996)  
. It is even commendable to have thick skin that allows one to shrug off slights and insults, and in a dignity-based   
society parents might teach children some version of “sticks and stones   
may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”—an idea that would   
be alien in a culture of honor (Leung and Cohen 2011:509). People are   
t  
o avoid insulting others, too, whether intentionally or not, and in general an ethic of self-restraint prevails (Elias 1982:230–286; see, e.g., Vidich   
and Bensman 1958:38–39, 45–46).5

A Culture of Victimhood

P 15

40

The ideals of dignity are no longer settled morality. The microaggression   
program rejects one of dignity culture’s main injunctions—to ignore   
i  
nsults and slights—and instead encourages at least some people to take notice of them and take action against them. The idea is that such offenses   
do cause harm, just like violence. Law professor Catharine Wells says,   
“The time has come to recognize the harm that microaggressions cause to   
women and people of color. There is an old saying about sticks and stones   
and words that never hurt, but these words are hurtful” (2013:  
337). She sees the physical pain and injury from “sticks and stones” as equivalent to   
the emotional hurt said to result from microaggressions.

41

In rejecting dignity culture’s distinction between violent offenses and   
merely verbal ones, victimhood culture resembles honor culture.   
Honorable people are sensitive to insult, so they might understand how   
microaggressions could be severe offenses demanding a serious response.   
But honor cultures value unilateral aggression and disparage appeals for   
help. Public complaints that advertise or even exaggerate one’s own vic-t  
imization and need for sympathy would be anathema to a person of honor, tantamount to showing that one had no honor at all.6   
Complaints about microaggressions combine the sensitivity to slight that we see in   
honor cultures with the willingness to appeal to authorities and other third   
parties that we see in dignity cultures. And victimhood culture differs from   
both honor and dignity cultures in highlighting rather than downplaying   
t

Remember that in a victimhood culture, along with the sensitivity to   
slight goes a tendency to handle conflicts through appeals to third parties.   
Sometimes appeals to third parties may simply be a matter of seeking sup-port and validation from one’s social media network and other distant   
s  
ympathizers, but for campus activists the focus is often on compelling authoritative action from administrators. At the University of Missouri,   
the president and chancellor both resigned in the face of student protests

43

43

accusing them of not taking sufficient action when African American stu-dents reported being the targets of racial slurs (Gaude 2015; Severn   
2015). Among the protesters’ demands were that the president “acknowl-edge his white male privilege,” and as a result of the uproar, campus police   
now urge students to call them in cases where someone uses racial slurs   
(S. Nelson 2015b; Severn 2015). For the protesters, failing to take drastic   
action in response to verbal offenses made campus officials oppressors in   
t  
heir own right, and the students appealed to still higher authorities and public opinion at large to pressure the authorities out of their jobs.   
Notably, one protester resorted to a hunger strike, a method of winning   
a  
ttention and sympathy by victimizing oneself. And win attention and sympathy it did, as the conflict drew the attention of the governor of   
Missouri and sparked protests at colleges across the United States   
(Hartocollis and Bidgood 2015). It may have even inspired a student at   
Claremont McKenna College in California to threaten a hunger strike   
when offended by an email written by the school’s dean, who quickly   
offered her resignation when accused of verbally victimizing the school’s   
Latina population (Margolis 2015)

43

Professors Erika and Nicholas Christakis of Yale University became the   
targets of protests when students accused them of creating an unsafe space   
for questioning whether the university should be involved in regulating   
potentially offensive Halloween costumes. The protesters were unsatisfied   
when Nicholas Christakis responded by offering an apology in which he   
said he had “disappointed” the students who took offense when he   
attempted to engage them in dialogue about the issue (Stanley-Becker   
2015; Worland 2015). Eventually the Christakises resigned their positions   
as the headmasters of one of Yale’s residential colleges, and Erika Christakis   
left Yale entirely.

43

The targets of such complaints often apologize in some manner, as   
Nicholas Christakis did; others fully capitulate and may even endorse fur-ther regulation from above. One University of Chicago student who was   
s  
anctioned for wearing a culturally insensitive Halloween costume, for example, stated that he agreed the university should do more to regulate   
what costumes students wear (Coyne 2015)

43

The Christakises’ comments about the debates over Halloween cos-tumes were narrowly focused and fairly nuanced. Others have been more   
sweeping in their criticisms of various manifestations of victimhood cul-ture and have likewise elicited strong reactions from campus activists.   
When individualist feminist Wendy McElroy appeared at Brown University

to debate the merits of the term rape culture, some students set up a s  
afe space for people who needed to escape from or recuperate from McElroy’s   
arguments. This was a room with “cookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play- Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as   
well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma” (Shulevitz   
2015). Student Emma Hall tells of attending part of the talk but retreat-ing to the safe space after “feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that   
really go against my dearly and closely held beliefs” (quoted in Shulevitz   
2015)

The emerging vic-timhood culture appears to share dignity’s disdain for risk, but it condones   
c  
alling attention to oneself as long as one is calling attention to one’s own hardships—to weaknesses rather than strengths and to exploitation rather   
than exploits. For example, students writing personal statements as part of   
t  
heir applications for colleges and graduate schools often write not of t  
heir academic achievements but instead—with the encouragement of the universities—about overcoming adversity such as a parent’s job loss or having   
to shop at thrift stores (Lieber 2014).9 And in a setting where people   
increasingly eschew toleration and publicly air complaints to compel offi-cial action, personal discomfort looms large in official policy. Consider   
recent calls for trigger warnings   
in college classes or on course syllabuses to forewarn students that they are about to be exposed to topics that   
might cause them distress, such as when a guide for faculty at Oberlin   
C  
ollege (later withdrawn after faculty complaints) suggested that the novel Things Fall Apart, which takes place in colonial Nigeria, could “trig-ger students who have experienced racism, colonialism, religious persecu-tion, violence, suicide, and more” (quoted in Medina 2014). Similarly, at   
Rutgers University an article in the student newspaper suggested that an

, in an essay critical of this phenomenon, complains that “too many of my students insist on writing essays that I can only describe as   
‘narratives of suffering.’” As he puts it, possibly exaggerating in describing the logic of the   
students’ letters, “If your parents are immigrants, mention it. If one of your parents drinks,   
or is in prison, don’t hide it—wallow in it! If you moved around a lot, if you grew up sur-rounded by drugs or violence—share, share, share!” (Schwyzer 2006)

would notify students that it depicted suicide, domestic abuse, and graphic violence (Wythe

victimhood is a kind of moral status,

47

Moral Status and Victimhood

47

When we think of differences in social status, inequalities of wealth or   
authority come readily to mind. The rich are higher in status than the   
poor, and bosses are higher in status than their subordinates. Perhaps it is   
less obvious that morality engenders a form of inequality. It does so in part   
because people adhere to moral codes to different degrees, and others   
punish or reward them accordingly. Engaging in deviant acts lowers one’s   
moral status, as does being punished, fairly or not, for such behavior.   
Conversely, engaging in praiseworthy acts or being rewarded for doing so   
raises one’s moral status (Black 1976:111–112; Cooney 2009:  
110–111). Whether and to what extent various kinds of conduct are deviant or praise-worthy varies, though, so we can identify different types of moral status.

47

various kinds of moral status normally increase or   
decrease as a result of deviant or praiseworthy behavior. Sometimes,   
though, being the victim of an offense might elevate one’s status regard-less of whether one has done anything praiseworthy. It is easy to see how   
this could come to be. Holding the victim of an offense in higher regard   
can be a way of reversing the harmful effects of the offense, and even a way   
of punishing the offender, since one is rewarding the person the offender   
wanted to harm or punish. This is victimhood, a kind of moral status based   
on suffering and neediness. And if victimhood is a virtue, privilege is a vice.

48

2

48

It has the same relationship to victimhood that cowardice does to honor,   
and admonitions to “check your privilege” are analogous to the shaming   
of cowards that we see in honor cultures.

48

Victimhood exists in a variety of contexts, but like honor and dignity it   
plays a greater role in some than in others. Those enmeshed in a culture of   
victimhood might also value dignity and perhaps even elements of honor,   
but to a greater degree than elsewhere they emphasize the moral worth of   
v  
ictims and their allies, while condemning the vice of privilege and the evil of oppression.

48

Now picture the opposite extreme: a setting where there is a   
high level of deference to and concern for those who have been hurt,   
oppressed, or in any way disadvantaged. Surely any offense against them   
would seem especially odious, as would any failure to fully take their side.   
If we came to view certain ethnicities and other groups of people as espe-c  
ially vulnerable, we might condemn any banter that might make them uncomfortable as a kind of microaggression. We would worry that expo-sure to any reminders of their oppression would trigger their trauma. We   
certainly would not minimize their victimhood or contest their definition   
of the situation by telling them to develop thick skin, to ignore slights, and   
to interpret others’ actions in the best possible light. We might instead   
demand that authorities do something to protect them from all these   
threats and remedy their situation, perhaps by creating safe spaces.  
And those who see themselves as oppressed might agree, urging others to be   
conscious of their privilege and circumspect in their words.

48

Calling it this highlights our con-cept of victimhood as moral status,

48

It does not imply anything about the motives or psychol-ogy of those who claim to have been hurt by others.

Note: perhaps that’s where neitzsche can come into play

49

It is likewise difficult to admit that privilege can ever be a liability.   
Earlier we discussed Lukianoff and Haidt’s concept of vindictive

AND THE

protectiveness, which involves the tendency to punish offenders in the   
name of guarding the feelings of those thought to be weak and disadvan-taged. They say this “creates a culture in which everyone must think twice   
before they speak up, lest they face charges of insensitivity, aggression, or   
worse” (Lukianoff and Haidt 2015). The term crybully points to the same   
t  
hing. But the advocates of this type of morality seldom acknowledge they are harming, much less bullying, anyone. Not everyone can be recognized   
as a victim, though, and designating one group as protected implicitly   
designates others as unprotected. While some advocates justify this   
inequality as serving the purpose of counterbalancing other systemic ineq-uities, such as the continuing effects of historic oppression, it seems that   
others have difficulty recognizing that the distinction creates any inequal-i

That it does so is an inevitable consequence of the culture, but it is   
such a challenge to the culture’s core ideals that victimhood adherents   
have developed a specialized vocabulary defining offenses in a way that   
prevents speaking of members of dominant groups as victims.

50

They   
might define racism so that blacks by definition cannot ever be racists or   
whites victims of racism (Neff 2015), sexism so that women cannot be   
sexist or men victims of sexism (Davoran 2015), and even censorship so   
that “the oppressed by definition cannot censor their oppressor”   
(Dean- Johnson et al. 2015).

Note: to me this seems like an attempt to reverse the power dynamics from a place of resentment

First of all, they involve the   
p  
ublic airing of grievances—complaining to outsiders. In this way microaggression complaints belong to a larger class of conflict tactics in   
which people who have grievances appeal to third parties. Second, micro-aggression complaints are attempts to demonstrate a pattern of injustice,   
a  
nd in this way they belong to a class of tactics by which people persuade reluctant third parties that their cause is just and they badly need help.   
And third, microaggression complaints are complaints about the domina-tion and oppression of cultural minorities.

66

Much of the social control that occurs in day-to-day life involves only   
the aggrieved and the offender.1 Microaggression complaints are usually   
different, however. When people post accounts of microaggressions on   
websites, or when they report them to campus administrators, they are   
publicly airing their grievances to people who might otherwise be unaware   
of them. In doing so they recruit other people to join the conflict. And   
they sometimes do so with the stated purpose of compelling further   
a  
ction—motivating either the general public or the authorities to take action against wrongdoing. Like gossipers, protesters, litigants, and so   
many others, they seek to attract the attention, sympathy, or intervention   
of third parties.

When law is weak or absent, how do people handle wrongdoing? How   
do they respond to theft, assault, and other offenses? In times and places   
where people cannot count on the legal system to protect their persons   
and property, they often rely on violent aggression to defend themselves   
and punish offenders. Students of law and social control refer to this kind   
of aggression as self-help because the aggrieved parties take matters into   
their own hands rather than relying on a legal system (Black 1998:74).5  
O  
ne of the most dramatic manifestations of self-help is vengeance killing, which may spark a cycle of retaliatory killings in the form of a blood feud—  
two different kinship groups exchanging killings over time, a life for a life

(Black 2004). Stateless societies have a great deal of vengeance and other

Resorting to police and courts is only a special case of relying on a third   
party to handle the conflict (Black and Baumgartner 1983). As noted   
a  
bove people bring their complaints to other kinds of authorities, such as children complaining to parents or employees reporting misconduct to   
their supervisor (Baumgartner 1984; Black 1998:85–88). All these behav-iors share a major social condition: The people involved in the dispute   
have access to a higher-status third party. The third party might be some-o  
ne only slightly higher in status, such as people in a tribal village bringing their dispute before a respected elder, or the third party might have the   
p  
ower and authority of the state. And just as law can discourage people from handling conflicts on their own, so too can other kinds of authori-ties. Whether these authorities actively suppress other ways of handling   
conflict or merely provide an easy and appealing alternative, their presence   
can lead to a kind of moral dependency.

71

We can observe this on college and university campuses, where adminis-trators often handle conflicts among students and faculty. Educational insti-tutions not only police such academic misconduct as cheating and plagiarism,   
but also increasingly enact codes forbidding interpersonal offenses, such as   
Fordham University’s ban on using email to insult another person, or New   
York University’s prohibition of mocking others (Lukianoff 2014:41). When   
two students at Dartmouth College were insulted by a third student who   
“verbally harassed them by speaking gibberish that was perceived to be mock   
Chinese,” they reacted not by confronting the offender but instead by   
reporting the incident to the College’s Office of Pluralism and Leadership,   
leading both the school’s Department of Safety and Security and its Bias   
Incident Response Team to launch an investigation into the identity of the   
offender (Owens 2013). In other social settings the same offense might have   
met with a direct response, whether a complaint to the offender, a retaliatory   
insult, or physical violence. But in a setting where a powerful organization   
metes out justice, the aggrieved relied on complaint rather than action.

71

In sum, the presence of people of higher social status—especially those   
such as legal officials or private administrators who are part of an organi-zational hierarchy—is conducive to reliance on third parties. But remem-ber that relying on third parties can involve more than complaining to   
authorities. People might also bring their grievances to the attention of the

72

72

general public. This can be a powerful sanction in and of itself, possibly   
shaming an offender, but it can also be a tool for motivating the authori-ties to intervene. Politicians and campus administrators might be reluctant   
to act unless public opinion demands it.7 The core of much modern activ-ism seems to be to draw attention to grievances and so convince either the   
public or authorities to remedy the situation.

72

Why   
do they use the term aggression to refer to remarks or behaviors that might   
otherwise be described as merely rude, awkward, or ignorant? The term   
h  
as the connotation of intentional attack, something generally viewed as more severe than the often inadvertent slights condemned as microaggres-sions. Calling them aggressions is a way of pointing out that they are part   
of a pattern of systematic oppression. But why do microaggression com-plainants conceptualize and present the offenses this way, as part of a pat-tern rather than as isolated offenses? It is a way of campaigning for support.   
Remember that the second major feature of microaggression complaints is   
that they are attempts to convince third parties that the offenses are actu-ally severe enough to concern them. But why do they need convincing?

72

those who started the first websites dedicated to   
documenting microaggressions stated that their aim was to call attention to   
numerous offenses in order to demonstrate the existence of a larger pattern   
of inequality. The concept of microaggression gained currency as part of a   
movement seeking to make the case that, collectively, these offenses were   
more severe than any individual incident. Those who publicize microag-gressions hope to draw support for a moral crusade by showing that the   
injustices are more severe than observers might realize—that people

73

73

complaining about microaggressions are not, as some critics charge, merely   
being oversensitive, given that, as one microaggression website puts it, the   
“slow accumulation” of such offenses “during a childhood and over a life-time is in part what defines a marginalized experience” (Microaggressions   
P roject 2014). In this view the offenses in question contribute to the mar-ginalization of entire groups of people. Either side in a conflict might cre-ate a reality tailored to portraying its adversary in the worst possible light,   
and itself in the best, with the aim of convincing others to take sides. Thus   
the movement to document microaggressions resembles other campaigns   
to convince reluctant third parties to take sides and take action, from the   
propaganda of political parties to the evidence presented in courts of law   
(Feeley 1979:168–74; Cooney 1994; Pizzi 1999:

Partisanship is taking sides in a conflict, and like any other conflict behav-ior we can explain it with the social features of the conflict. Black’s theory   
of partisanship identifies two conditions that make support from third

74

74

parties more likely. First, third parties are more likely to act as partisans   
when they are socially closer to one side of the conflict than to the other,   
as they take the side of the socially closer disputant (Black 1998:  
126). They may be relationally closer to, or more intimate with, one side, or they   
may be culturally closer, meaning they share social characteristics such as   
religion, ethnicity, or language. All else equal, any social tie or social simi-larity a third party shares with one disputant but not the other increases   
the chance of partisanship. For example, among the Arusha of Tanzania,   
people are “readily able to determine their allegiance, or their exclusion   
from allegiance, in a situation of conflict and dispute” based on member-ship in patrilineal kin groups and genealogical segments within those   
groups (Gulliver 1963:118, quoted in Black 1998:  
128). The Bedouins of Arabia express this sociological law of partisanship in the proverb “myself   
against my brother, my brother and I against my cousin, my cousin, my   
brother, and I against the stranger” (Murphy and Kasdan 1959:

74

Tribal and traditional societies are typically organized around kinship,   
and kinship groups often have a level of intimacy and solidarity difficult for   
people in more individualistic societies to imagine, leading to extremes of   
partisanship when kin are wronged by outsiders. As Jared Diamond   
observes, it can be difficult for modern people to understand how these   
dense networks of lifelong ties affect the handling of conflict: “To us   
Westerners, it seems absurd that the damaging of a garden of a member of   
o  
ne clan by a pig belonging to a member of another clan could trigger a w  
ar between the two clans; to New Guinea Highlanders, that outcome is unsurprising” (Diamond 2013:90). The quasi-religious intensity of kin-ship ties helps explain why conflicts between people from groups with no   
common connection are prone to escalate into collective violence (Cooney   
1998:79; Senechal de la Roche 2001). Members of modern street gangs   
also tend to have unusually close bonds and uphold partisanship toward   
fellow gang members against outsiders as a “sacred duty” (Decker and Van   
Winkle 1996:180, quoted in Cooney 1998:79). But note that the stron-gest partisanship requires a combination of closeness and distance. When   
third parties are equally close to or distant from both sides, they tend   
toward neutrality (Black 1998, see also Cooney 1998:Chapter 4).8

75

5

75

Second, third parties are more likely to act as partisans when one side   
of a conflict is higher in status than the other, as they take the side of the   
higher-status disputant (Black 1998:126). Social elites throughout history   
have been able to count on the support of their subordinates: “In ancient   
Rome, upper-class men … could rally a ‘gang’ of followers to resist their   
legal opponents and enemies. In medieval England, where servants were   
widespread (even among wealthier peasants), masters had similar advan-tages” (Black 1998:127, citations omitted). In modern societies those   
with wealth and fame also attract more support in their conflicts, including   
people willing to testify on their behalf in court (Cooney 2009:  
92). A poor and disreputable person, such as a street-level drug dealer or home-l  
ess vagrant, is unlikely to attract such spontaneous help, especially when facing wealthy and powerful opponents.

75

This is not to say that no one ever expresses greater sympathy toward   
or tries to help the weaker party in a conflict. The entire basis of claims of   
victimhood is to generate exactly this kind of sympathy. But such sympa-thy for the underdog is likely only under particular conditions, and the   
more general pattern is for low-status people to attract less support against   
high-status people than vice versa. Someone who lacks wealth and educa-tion, who has a bad reputation or criminal record, and who belongs to a   
cultural minority will find it extremely hard if not impossible to attract   
strong and uncompromising support against an adversary who is very   
wealthy and educated, reputable, and part of the cultural majority.

75

We propose that active campaigns to convince third parties to give their   
support are most likely to arise under conditions conducive to slow and   
weak partisanship. In other words, efforts to produce and shape evidence

76

5

76

operate most frequently and effectively where third parties might be will-ing to take a side but are not certain to do so.

76

Campaigns will tend to be aimed at those who are not so close to the   
aggrieved or distant from the adversary that their support is automatic,   
but also not so distant from the aggrieved and close to the adversary that   
it is unthinkable. Campaigns will be most frequent in social settings where   
many third parties occupy a neutral zone and usually either do not get   
involved at all or else just express a weak preference for one side or the   
other. Again, quick, strong, certain partisanship occurs most frequently in   
settings where people are divided up into groups that are internally solidary   
b  
ut mutually alien—like feuding clans in tribal societies. The opposite condition—social atomization, where people act as autonomous individu-als with little involvement in stable and solidary groups—leads to a decline   
in strong partisanship (Senechal de la Roche 2001)

76

Social atomization is typically greater in present-day industrial societies   
than in past societies. Large, dense populations and a market economy   
require constant dealings with non-kin. Wealth and technology result in   
high levels of geographic and social mobility. Formal schooling displaces   
parental socialization, and insurance companies and state welfare agencies   
reduce the need to rely on family in hard times. The breakdown of strong   
communal bonds began long ago in the West, and in modern America and   
elsewhere this social atomization has continued throughout the twentieth   
century. In his book Bowling Alone, political scientist Robert Putnam doc-uments the decline of a variety of voluntary organizations that were once   
a part of the fabric of American communities, including religious congre-gations, social clubs, fraternal organizations like the Masons or Elks, and   
parent–teacher associations (Putnam 2000)  
. Even bowling leagues have s  
een their memberships plummet, and as the title of Putnam’s book hints, it is not because fewer people bowl; it is because they are less likely to do   
so as part of an enduring and formally organized group.9

77

5

77

The decline of dense networks of strong, enduring, and overlapping   
bonds has two major results. The first is to render an increasing amount of   
conflict private.10 Marital arguments, family quarrels, and tensions between   
friends and neighbors increasingly occur behind closed doors and without   
the involvement of anyone else at all.11   
The second is that when people do seek the support of third parties, they are less likely to rely on a core group   
of die-hard supporters and more likely to find themselves campaigning to   
attract the attention and sympathy of distant acquaintances and total   
s

77

Consider also the role of social status. Here too we expect to see cam-paigns for support flourishing when the conditions are conducive to weak   
or hesitant partisanship rather than automatic support or automatic oppo-sition. Thus campaigns for support should be more likely when a person   
or group has grievances against someone of higher status, but not when   
the status differences between the two are at their most extreme.   
Microaggression complaints have just that kind of structure. They are   
typically complaints on behalf of cultural minorities or other social groups   
that have lower aggregate status, such as lower levels of wealth, education,   
and authority. Many are concerned with discrimination by white Americans   
against black Americans, who as a group were historically dominated by   
whites and who continue to have drastically lower levels of aggregate   
wealth and education (see, e.g., Conley 1999). Microaggression com-p  
laints also commonly have to do with slights against gays and lesbians, who have often been treated as deviant or disreputable. But note that   
while microaggression complaints tend to be upward—minority against

78

5

78

majority, stigmatized against socially accepted—neither the complaints   
nor the campaigns to publicize them come from the lowest reaches of   
society. The concept of microaggression did not first proliferate among   
the chronically poor, such as among the unemployed coal miners of   
Eastern Kentucky or among the impoverished African Americans of   
Baltimore or New Orleans. It first proliferated among college and univer-sity students, a relatively affluent, educated, and respectable population.   
And the microaggression program seems to have developed most quickly   
at elite institutions, such as private liberal arts colleges and Ivy League   
universities. A minority student at Oberlin College or Harvard University   
may indeed be from a lower-status background than the average Oberlin   
or Harvard student, but compared to the US population as a whole, or   
even to students at other colleges and universities, students at elite educa-tional institutions are not particularly lowly.

78

The socially down and out are unlikely to campaign for public support,   
just as they are unlikely to receive it. To what potentially sympathetic pub-lic could a slave turn to for support against an unusually brutal master?   
Slaves in the antebellum South might run away, or they might express   
grievances in various covert ways, but they did not post lists of accumu-lated grievances in the local newspaper.12 Campaigns for support emerge   
not where the structure of partisanship favors only strong allies or strong   
enemies, but somewhere in between, where third parties offer only weak   
or potential support.

83

83

the third notable feature of microaggres-sion complaints: that the grievances focus on inequality and oppression—  
especially inequality and oppression based on cultural characteristics such

84

5

84

as ethnicity or gender. Microaggressions are offensive to those aggrieved   
by them because they believe they perpetuate or increase the domination   
of some persons and groups by others.

84

those who promulgate microaggression com-plaints would surely view criticism of minorities as the very kind of   
oppression they seek to expose and eradicate. The phenomenon thus illus-trates a particular type of morality that is especially concerned with equal-ity and diversity and sees any act that perpetuates inequality or decreases

Settings with little diversity are likely to develop a morality that values   
cultural purity and is hostile to differences (Black 2011:144). In such set-tings, virtue means adhering to the accepted beliefs and rituals or family,   
n

microaggression complainants collect and publicize accounts of   
minor intercollective offenses, making the case that they are part of a larger   
pattern of injustice and that those who suffer them are socially marginal-ized and deserving of sympathy. The phenomenon is sociologically similar   
to other forms of social control that involve airing grievances to authorities   
or to the public as a whole, that actively manage social information in a   
campaign to convince others to intervene in some way, and that emphasize   
the dominance of the adversary and the victimization of the aggrieved.

87

Under these conditions individuals are likely to   
express grievances about oppression, and aggrieved individuals are likely   
to depend on the aid of third parties, to cast a wide net in their attempt to   
find supporters, and to campaign for support by emphasizing their own   
need against a bullying adversary.

88

6

88

Social atomization has increased, undermining the tight-knit networks that   
once encouraged confrontational modes of social control and provided indi-viduals with strong partisans, while at the same time modern technology has   
allowed for mass communication to a virtual sea of weak partisans.

88

This last trend has been especially dramatic during the past decade, with   
the result that aggrieved individuals can potentially appeal to millions of   
third parties. In our experience with media services such as Twitter and   
Facebook, we have noticed that many use these forums to publicly vent   
grievances and to solicit sympathetic responses not only from friends but   
also from distant acquaintances and total strangers.

88

Such Twitter   
campaigns—sometimes referred to as hashtag activism—are effectively epi-sodes of mass gossip in which hundreds, thousands, or perhaps millions of   
third parties discuss deviant behavior and express support for one side   
against another. Like gossip in the small town or village, such public com-plaining may be the sole way of handling the conflict, or it might eventually   
lead to further action against the deviant, such as dismissal by supervisors or   
investigation by legal authorities. As social media becomes ever more ubiq-uitous, the ready availability of the court of public opinion may make public   
disclosure of offenses an increasingly likely course of action.

89

89

We have discussed how microaggression complaints illustrate a   
morality that values diversity and is highly sensitive to intolerance of dif-ferences. But some manifestations of victimhood culture also display a   
kind of intolerance to difference and disagreement. The same progressive   
activists who campaign against microaggressions might also call for the   
banning of conservative speakers, for the forbidding of displays of support   
for certain political candidates, and for the creation of safe spaces where   
progressive ideas can go unchallenged by opposing views. They might also   
express extreme vitriol toward those holding views that are considered   
fairly moderate elsewhere in society. So in addition to the morality of tol-erance, in which differences are celebrated, there also appears to be a   
morality of purity, in which differences are offensive.

Note: they’re not just hostile towards viewpoints from anyone right to them on the political spectrum, they’re hostile towards *any* criticism even from there own side. The problem isn’t that there isn’t enough conservatives, it’s the demand for ideological uniformity 

89

The morality of tolerance and the morality of purity are opposites, and   
they arise from opposite conditions: Diversity breeds tolerance, and homo-geneity breeds purity. How then is it possible for both to arise in the same   
setting? It is possible because there are multiple dimensions of diversity. A   
social setting might have a lot of racial diversity, but not religious diversity,   
a lot of political diversity, but no linguistic diversity, and so on. Because   
different dimensions of diversity can vary independently, a social setting   
might engender tolerance of one kind of diversity, such as ethnic diversity,   
and intolerance of another, such as political diversity.

89

This appears to be the situation on many campuses. Only 12 percent   
of US university faculty identify as politically conservative, and the   
proportion is even smaller in the social sciences and humanities, where   
many scholars openly identify as leftwing activists seeking to advance their   
political views through scholarship and teaching (Haidt et al. n.d.). Yet   
political and social conservatives are not a small minority in the larger   
society, and they are not a historically disadvantaged group that attracts   
sympathy and support in an egalitarian culture. Indeed, conservatives   
often oppose the preferred policies of campus activists and are openly   
critical of their views. The result is they are often treated not only as   
political adversaries, but as heretics who pollute the ideological purity   
of  politically homogeneous environments. Microaggression complaints   
do  not deal with slights against these ideological minorities, and the   
champions of victimhood culture on college campuses freely demonize

the enemies in their midst. Yet even as they do so, they do so in terms of   
the framework of victimhood culture: Those who disagree are racist,   
misogynist, ableist, homophobic, Islamophobic, transphobic, and so   
forth. They are bullies who attack those who are disadvantaged and dif-ferent. Blind to their power and privilege, they victimize entire classes of   
vulnerable and sympathetic people. Their offense is severe, and must be

Any individual person can be classified in terms of multiple socially   
meaningful categories. A person might be black or white, male or   
female, gay or straight, Christian or Muslim, and so forth. This means   
that many people will have memberships in some more disadvantaged   
categories but also in some more advantaged ones. And those who com-bine many victim identities will claim and be accorded greater moral

status than those with only a few. The result is that not even members   
of marginalized groups are safe from accusations of being privileged and   
insensitive to the suffering of the less fortunate. A gay man who cri-tiques heteronormativity, homophobia, and straightsplaining may in   
turn be criticized for being a man (and thus more privileged than a   
woman, especially a lesbian) as well as for identifying with his biological   
sex (making him less oppressed than a transgender person).

192

For exam-ple, in 2016 the UK’s National Union of Students’ LGBT Campaign   
passed a motion for campus LGBT groups to exclude gay men because   
they “don’t face oppression” (Duffy 2016). The author of an essay in   
Jezebel begins with, “I am a white, cisgender gay guy … the queer   
equivalent of ‘The Man’ … parties become less diverse when I walk in”   
before asking, “Can a nontrans, white gay man ever truly leave the com-forts of his own identity without having to make frequent and loud   
apologies for the crimes of his ilk?” (Rosen 2011, cited in Bovy   
2017:35). In 2017 three Jewish participants in an annual Chicago   
LGBT event called the “Dyke March” were asked to leave because they   
carried a rainbow colored flag emblazoned with the Star of David, a   
symbol of Judaism. They were told the flag, a symbol of LGBT Jewish   
identity, “made people feel unsafe” because the Star of David is also on   
the Israeli flag, and the march was “pro-Palestinian” and “anti-Zionist”   
(Haaretz 2017). That same year, the black director of the Claremont   
colleges’ LGBT center tweeted his preference to keep his distance from   
“white gays and well- meaning white women” (Dordick 2017)

192

Such infighting between activists and victim groups is sometimes   
referred to as a purity spiral.  
The idea is that members of ideological and religious movements might strive to outdo one another in displays of   
zealotry, condemning and expelling members of their own movement for   
smaller and smaller deviations from its core virtues. Perhaps only a minor-ity of the most aggressive members take the lead in this, but because fail-ing to condemn deviants opens one up to charges of being deviant oneself,   
others tend to either join in or passively acquiesce.14 The result is an ever- increasing demand for moral purity, and ever-greater effort to meet the   
standards of the group.

192

14 For this reason people may even condemn others for failing to adhere to norms they   
themselves privately reject (Willer et al. 2009).

193

193

In a victimhood culture, purity spirals revolve around claims of vic-timhood, privilege, and oppression. They are led by those with the great-est victimhood status and those who have the greatest sensitivity to   
slight. And their primary targets are not those fully outside of the cul-ture, and thus less sensitive to the opinions of its members. Instead it is   
ideological sympathizers and allies who most fear being shamed. Writing   
in The National Post, Jonathan Kay argues that aggressive leftist Twitter   
users act as a “crowdsourced ideological autocracy” whose shaming tac-tics primarily victimize “public figures who … are creatures of the left …   
since these are the same figures whose legitimacy as politicians, activists   
and writers depends” on appeasing those who shame them.15 He notes   
that “elected politicians and established mainstream media figures” are   
especially likely to attract social media shaming because “the more actual   
power one is perceived as having in a society suffused with sexism, het-eronormativity, white supremacism etc., the less moral capital is ascribed   
to you” (Kay 2017). But even rank and file activists may live in fear of   
being shunned. “There is an underlying current of fear in my activist   
communities,” writes graduate student Frances Lee. “It is the fear of   
appearing impure. Social death follows when being labeled a ‘bad’ activ-ist or simply ‘problematic’ enough times” (Lee 2017). Lee goes on to   
e  
laborate:I self-police what I say in activist spaces. I stopped commenting on social   
m  
edia with questions or pushback on leftist opinions for fear of being called out. I am always ready to apologize for anything I do that a community   
member deems wrong, oppressive, or inappropriate—no questions asked.   
The amount of energy I spend demonstrating purity in order to stay in the   
good graces of a fast-moving activist community is enormous…. At times, I   
have found myself performing activism more than doing activism. I’m   
exhausted, and I’m not even doing the real work I am committed to do.   
(Lee 2017)

Given the activists’ goals, such attempts to vie for superior moral status   
and purify their own ranks are likely counterproductive. Social move-ments succeed by growing and expanding their numbers and by winning   
the support and patronage of the powerful and influential. Expelling   
those who are insufficiently righteous hampers the growth of any reli-gious or ideological movement and may present a special challenge for a   
movement that condemns privilege. Writing in The Guardian, Zoe   
Williams argues, “If only the truly marginalised can speak as feminists,   
that depletes our numbers…. And if people ‘with a platform’ are disquali-fied for being part of the power structure, that leaves us without a plat-form” (Williams 2013, quoted in Bovy 2017:174). Thus, among those   
who have adopted victimhood culture, competitive victimhood can   
simultaneously lead to an intensification of their morality as well as sow-ing divisions that slow its spread.

Nicholas and Erika Christakis at Yale could likewise say that the activ-ists hounding them did not even pretend the professors had injured them   
in any way. But again, the students of both periods have a higher sensitivity

victimhood rather than the culture of honor that is causing tumult on

Across societies and across history, few moral cultures have valued free   
speech much. Even societies that do value it still restrict some kinds of   
speech. And voluntary associations of all kinds tend to restrict speech for-mally or informally.

240

For several reasons, though, victimhood culture is   
particularly hostile to free speech. It shares with honor culture a tendency   
to perceive and to react to slights and a tendency to blur the distinction   
between speech and violence. And even more so than honor culture its   
strictures are potentially all encompassing. Small talk and course lectures,   
jokes and hobbies, books and tweets, artistic expressions, and scientific   
theories—just about anything might cause offense, with offended parties   
demanding offenders be silenced, fired, assaulted, banished, or reedu-cated.

240

Surely not all speech is of equal value. Why should we tolerate speech that   
is boring, impertinent, hateful, or wrong? If ideas have consequences, why   
should we allow people to spread ideas that will corrupt minds and disrupt   
the social order?

240

Are we really supposed to tolerate error? Free speech   
advocates say yes. Nineteenth-century English philosopher John Stuart   
Mill put it this way: “If all mankind minus one were of an opinion, man-kind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he   
had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind” (2005:  
42). In this view other people, no matter how numerous or powerful, simply have   
no right to prevent you from thinking freely and expressing your thoughts.

241

241

Mill went further. Silencing speech is an offense against those who are   
prevented from speaking, but also against those prevented from hearing   
them. On this point nineteenth-century abolitionist and former slave   
Frederick Douglas was in agreement. “To suppress free speech is a double   
wrong,” said Douglas. “It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those   
of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to hear and   
speak as it would be to rob him of his money” (quoted in Smith 2017)  
. Mill likened speech suppression to robbery as well: “The peculiar evil of   
silencing an expression of opinion,” he said, “is that it is robbing the   
human race, posterity as well as the existing generation—those who dis-sent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is   
right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth;   
if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception   
and livelier impression of truth produced by its collision with error” (Mill   
2005:42). In other words, whatever speech we would wish to silence   
might be correct, or partly correct. And calling “any proposition certain,   
while there is anyone who would deny its certainty if permitted, but who   
is not permitted, is to assume that we ourselves, and those who agree with   
us, are the judges of certainty, and judges without hearing the other side”   
(Mill 2005:47–48). But suppose we do know for certain an idea is wrong.   
Even so, it benefits us to be exposed to wrong ideas. Otherwise we become   
unable to defend and ultimately unable to understand the correct ideas we   
hold. We come to hold them “in the manner of a prejudice,” and their   
meaning is “in danger of becoming lost, or enfeebled” (Mill 2005:  
83). “  
He who knows only his own side of the case,” Mill said, “knows little of that” (2005:

241

Where the culture is generally hospita-ble to free speech, those restrictions tend to be narrow. Most groups do   
not expect conformity on all matters, and in any case there is plenty of   
interaction with outsiders and exposure to other views. But if tolerance for

242

2  
1

242

diverse ideas is not the norm, and if informal speech restrictions become   
so extreme and commonplace that people are reluctant to express themselves   
and rarely come into contact with unconventional ideas, then the dominant   
beliefs will go untested. A society where expressing unpopular ideas means   
you will be fired from any job, exposed in the media, and shunned by the   
community is not the kind of free speech society Mill described, even if you   
will not be burned at the stake. Still, government repression—burning her-etics, sending dissidents to the Gulag—has historically been a major obstacle   
to free speech, and drawing from Enlightenment ideals, liberal democracies   
have typically allowed government regulation of speech only within strict   
limits. This has been especially true of the United States.

242

Still, the US Supreme Court has allowed for a number of exceptions—  
that is, expression the government may restrict. Generally, what are known   
as content-neutral “time, place, and manner” restrictions on expression   
are more acceptable than content-based restrictions. Banning loudspeakers   
i  
n a neighborhood after 10:00 p.m. would be content neutral, while banning speech about abortion would be content based (Weinstein   
2009:82). Acceptable content-based restrictions fall into a number of spe-cific categories—for example, obscenity, child pornography, indecency,   
defamation, harassment, fighting words, true threats, incitement, copy-right and trademark violations, speech that endangers national security,   
and the disclosure of certain kinds of personal information (Melkonian   
2012:8; Silvergate et  al. 2012; Weinstein 2009:82). Governments can   
regulate some of these and other exceptions only minimally, while they

243

2  
1

243

can ban others completely, but they can almost never regulate expression   
based on the opinion that it conveys. This is known as viewpoint discrimi-nation, which the twentieth- century Supreme Court Justice William   
Brennan once called “censorship in its purest form” (quoted in Silvergate   
et  al. 2012:83). Thus, unlike in many liberal democracies, there is no   
exception for what is sometimes called hate speech. A number of other lib-eral democracies do have hate speech bans, but as James Weinstein points   
out, this is an example of a “speech regulation that would be summarily   
invalidated under contemporary American free speech jurisprudence”   
(2009:84). In general, whereas other countries “tend to employ soft, flex-ible standards that balance the free speech interest at issue in a particular   
case against the government’s interest in suppressing the speech, American   
doctrine is determined by hard-edged, determinative rules” (Weinstein   
2009:90). This is deliberate. The idea is that clear rules should protect free   
speech by constraining the discretion of governments, and they should   
enable people to know “with adequate certainty what they can safely say”   
(Weinstein 2009:

243

The Court has defined each free speech exception very narrowly so that   
governments cannot simply prohibit unpopular speech by labeling it   
obscenity, incitement, harassment, defamation, or whatever. Consider def-amation. Legal scholar Harry Melkonian describes “the right to reputa-tion protected by privacy and defamation laws” as “one of the countervailing   
values to freedom of expression” (2012:xxvii).

243

Sociologist Peter Berger pointed out that in American   
l  
aw “insult itself is not actionable,” and the fact that it is not, he said, is an indicator of “the obsolescence of the concept of honor” (1970:  
339). Defamation is not mere insult; it usually must involve material damage or   
at least psychic harm, “a far cry from a notion of offence against honor”   
(Berger 1970:339). It also must be false, so true statements or opinions   
cannot be defamation no matter how much they harm someone’s reputa-tion. Defamation law means free speech is not absolute, but its narrowness   
points to the weight that dignity cultures give to free speech over other   
ideals, particularly in the United States, where “the preference for free-dom of speech found in modern U.S. Supreme Court interpretations of

244

2

244

the First Amendment” contrasts sharply with, say, “the extremely strict   
common law libel regime in Australia” (Melkonian 2012:

247

When people talk about universities pursuing truth, what they usually have in   
mind, Williams notes, is “not a search for an ultimate truth for all time, but a   
contestable truth … \[to\] be countered and superseded when new and better   
knowledge” comes along (2016:15).

247

Campus activists, though, may believe   
they possess the full truth already. Unlike others they are aware, conscious, or   
in the know—or to use a more recent term, woke (Hess 2016). Or they may   
see all truth claims as exercises of power. In any case, for them the university’s   
mission is social justice rather than truth. The university is not to be a place   
where people hash out ideas and where even error is tolerated because others   
are free to contest it. It is to be set apart from the larger society not as a haven   
of free expression, but instead as a safe space where students are protected   
from oppression. As they see it, those defending the permissibility of speech   
that causes harm are defending oppression. Some activists even mock free   
speech advocates as defenders of what they call freeze peach (Lee 2013).3

247

Obviously censorship is not new, but the rationale for it now tends to   
arise from the ideals of victimhood culture. Political scientist April Kelly- Woessner (2015) finds that today’s young people are actually less politically

248

2

248

tolerant than the previous generation, a reversal of a 60-year-old trend.   
And among the younger generation (those under 40), those who are most   
concerned about social justice are the most intolerant.

248

campus activists have come   
to believe they may “limit the rights of their political opponents, so long as   
they frame their intolerance in terms of protecting others from hate”   
(Kelly-Woessner 2015)

248

The offensiveness of speech is often less about what people say than about   
wh

248

A speaker’s social position matters in other kinds of status systems,   
too, such as in the Jim Crow South, where blacks could not say certain   
things to or about whites. Free speech thrives more easily in a culture of   
dignity because the egalitarian idea of everyone’s equal worth leads to the   
i

248

Victimhood culture again makes social identity central to the moral   
analysis of speech. The speech of the oppressed is different from that of   
the oppressors and the privileged. This is why some people are told to   
check their privilege when speaking about certain topics (e.g., Dang   
2017). This is why, as we saw in Chap. 1, Derald Wing Sue says a white   
male elementary school teacher cannot be the victim of microaggressions   
(Hampson 2016). It is why, as we also saw previously, some activists   
argue that censorship on behalf of the oppressed should not even be   
called censorship (“The oppressed by definition cannot censor their   
oppressor”) (Dean-Johnson et al. 2015). It is why, according to journal-ism professor Jelani Cobb, “the arguments about the freedom of speech   
become most tone deaf” when they fail to take into account that “the

249

2  
2

249

freedom to offend the powerful is not equivalent to the freedom to bully   
the relatively disempowered” (2015). And it is why Ulrich Baer, Vice   
Provost for Faculty, Arts, Humanity, and Diversity at New York University,   
says, “Some topics, such as claims that some human beings are by defini-tion inferior to others, or illegal or unworthy of legal standing, are not   
open to debate because such people cannot debate them on their own   
terms.” An “absolute notion of free speech” thus places “under severe   
attack” the legal and cultural rights “of minorities to participate in public   
discourse” (Baer 2017)

249

If people experience speech differently based on their victimhood status,   
censorship of the speech of the powerful might be needed to protect the   
powerless. Some campus activists have even begun to argue that speech   
that harms the powerless is actually violence, or something akin to it, and   
that if administrators and other authorities will not protect students from   
this violence, the students have the right to protect themselves.

249

For exam-ple, after rioters at UC Berkeley forced the cancellation of an event featur-ing right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, the student run newspaper   
The Daily Californian published “Violence as Self Defense,” a collection   
of articles defending “the use of violence in protests” (Senju 2017)  
. The contributors view Yiannopoulos’s presence as an act of violence against the   
campus community, which means the protesters were only defending   
themselves when they used violence to prevent him from speaking. In this   
view the defenders of free speech who wanted the talk to go on were as   
complicit in the “violence” as Yiannopoulos and the student group that   
was hosting him. According to Berkeley alumna Nisa Dang, “asking peo-p  
le to maintain peaceful dialogue with those who literally do not think their lives matter is a violent act.” And to Yiannopoulos she has this to say:   
“Here’s a big fuck you from the descendants of people who survived   
genocides by killing Nazis and people just like them” (Dang 2017)  
. B  
erkeley student Juan Prieto chides the university for not being “bold e  
nough to stand against hate and cancel the speech,” and he praises those who used violence to do so: “A peaceful protest was not going to cancel   
that event, just like numerous letters from staff, faculty, Free Speech   
Movement veterans and even donors did not cancel the event. Only the   
destruction of glass and shooting of fireworks did that…. Everything else   
w

place on our campus” (Prieto 2017). Neil Lawrence, himself one of the   
masked protesters, has a similar argument for those who think the tactics   
were too extreme: “I understand…. But when you consider everything   
that activists already tried—when mass call-ins, faculty and student objec-tions, letter writing campaigns, numerous op-eds (including mine), union   
g  
rievances and peaceful demonstrations don’t work, when the nonviolent tactics have been exhausted—what is left?” He says the acts of violence   
were actually “acts of self defense” and ends with a warning to Yiannopoulos   
and those who invited him: “Our shields are raised against you. No one   
will protect us? We will protect ourselves” (Lawrence 2017). Another pro-tester, Desmond Meagley, writes, “I put my safety and freedom on the line   
because letting Yiannopoulos speak was more terrifying to me than poten-tial injury or arrest.” To anyone who condemns “the actions that shut   
down Yiannopoulos’ literal hate speech,” he says, “you condone his pres-ence, his actions and his ideas; you care more about broken windows than   
broken bodies” (Meagley 2017)

250

The idea of speech as violence might seem like a fringe view, but soci-ologist Laura Beth Nielsen (2017), writing in the Los Angeles Times   
in favor of hate speech restrictions, makes a similar argument. She says that if   
we think of speech restrictions as efforts to avoid hurt feelings, we will   
rightly prefer to have free speech. But the idea that we are only talking   
about hurt feelings, she says, “demonstrates a profound misunderstanding   
of how hate speech affects its targets.” Racist hate speech is much more   
like violence in the harm it does, given that research has linked it to “ciga-rette smoking, high blood pressure, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic   
stress disorder.” Nielsen does not call such speech violence, exactly, but   
she says it is not “just speech” because it results in “tangible harms that are   
serious in and of themselves and that collectively amount to the harm of   
subordination” (Nielsen 2017)

Note: if such stress comes from bring offended, then it’s self imposed harm

250

Psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett (2017) is another prominent propo-nent of this view. She writes in the New York Times   
that speech can have powerful and negative physical effects, including illness and aging. It can   
do so by causing stress, but merely offensive speech that causes only short   
bouts of stress is not harmful and can even be beneficial. Abusive   
speech, however, causes “long stretches of simmering stress.” Barrett says this dis-tinction can guide us deciding whether or not to ban speakers from cam-pus. In her view students at Middlebury College were wrong to try to   
prevent political scientist Charles Murray from speaking there. She says   
that Murray’s arguments about racial differences in IQ scores—the impe-

251

2  
2

251

tus behind the desire to ban him—might be offensive but are not abusive.   
She says Milo Yiannopoulos should be banned from campuses, though,   
because he engages in abusive speech. Speech like Yiannopoulos’s “bullies   
and torments” people, and “from the perspective of our brain cells … is   
literally a form of violence” (Barrett 2017)

30 free speech to as small a space as possible” (2014:  
Chapter 3). Another decades-old threat is the speech codes on many campuses that prevent   
students from using racial epithets and other kinds of slurs.  
For as long as these speech restrictions have been around, they have   
been subject to criticism, legal challenges, and mockery. As we noted in   
Chap. 5, critics in the 1980s and 1990s began describing efforts to reform   
and police language as political correctness. Examples include efforts to   
classify as offensive previously unoffensive words like “fireman” (to be   
replaced with “firefighter”) or “wife” (to be replaced with “partner”).   
Political correctness might also refer to efforts to classify as racial slurs   
words that had never had any racial connotation. One notorious case of   
this occurred in 1993 when the University of Pennsylvania charged a   
Jewish student with racial harassment for yelling, “Shut up, you water buf-falo!” out of his window when his study was disturbed by noise from   
members of a black sorority. The idea behind the charge was that w  
ater buffalo was an anti-black slur no one had heard before. It was in fact a   
translation of a Hebrew colloquialism applied to rowdy or thoughtless   
p  
eople, and the negative media attention eventually led the university to drop its case against the student (Lukianoff 2014:  
Chapter 2). In another case, this one from the late 1990s, a supporter of the University of   
Wisconsin’s speech code attempted to provide an example of why it was   
needed by reporting to the Faculty Senate that a professor had used the   
word niggardly while teaching about Chaucer (who used the word in his   
work). Niggardly means miserly, and it has no relation to the racial epithet   
nigger,  
but the student described herself as “in tears, shaking” even after the professor explained it. “It’s not up to the rest of the class to decide   
whether my feelings are valid,” she said (quoted in Kors 1999)  
. This complaint ended up turning opinion against the speech code—the oppo-site of what the complainant intended. An editorial in the Wisconsin State   
Journal even thanked the complainant “for clarifying precisely why the   
UW-Madison does not need an academic speech code” (quoted in Kors   
1999)

254

Then as now, most speech restrictions were attempts to protect mem-bers of historically disadvantaged groups. Still, despite excesses like these,   
speech restrictions were supposed to be about intentional racial and ethnic   
slurs and the like. More recently, though, with the ascendance of a full- blown campus victimhood culture, activists and administrators have   
dropped the pretense that they only want to interfere with the most offen-sive speech. The entire microaggression program is rooted in the notion

255

2  
3

255

that when members of victim groups interact with outgroups they are   
constantly wounded by inadvertent slights. This is not just a matter of   
activists trying to raise awareness about microaggressions, either. We have   
seen that universities themselves address microaggressions in documents   
and training programs, with the University of California and universities   
throughout the country encouraging faculty to avoid microaggressions   
like “Why are you so quiet?” and “America is a melting pot.” Remember   
too that the lists of microaggressions are not exhaustive; anything could   
be a microaggression, including, presumably, saying water buffalo or nig-gardly, since the microaggressor’s intentions do not matter. The Wisconsin   
student’s insistence that it was not up to others to decide whether her   
feelings were valid is now in line with many universities’ official policies.   
Universities trying to involve themselves in preventing or punishing   
microaggressions are claiming jurisdiction over every word spoken on   
campus, over every glance or expression. Under any conception of free   
speech the exceptions are rare while most speech is protected, but this is   
far from that. The logic of victimhood culture means no speech is clearly   
protected.

255

In Chap. 1 we discussed the many efforts (sometimes successful) to prevent   
Milo Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro from speaking on campuses whenever   
a university student group invites one of them. DePaul University has   
banned them both, and at public universities, which are not free to engage   
in viewpoint discrimination, activist students and faculty mobilize against   
their presence. At Berkeley university officials cancelled a Yiannopoulos   
event out of safety concerns after a riot by students and others opposed to   
the event resulted in $100,000 worth of damage to the university. Ann   
Coulter is another conservative speaker who attracts controversy, and not   
long after the anti-Yiannopoulos riots, two student groups who were spon-soring a talk Coulter was to give at Berkeley cancelled it due to threats of   
violence (Peters and Fuller 2017)

257

In early 2017 Murray was to   
give a talk based on this book at Middlebury College, but some students   
wanted to prevent this based in part on their belief that Murray was a   
white supremacist.

257

Charles Murray is a libertarian political scientist with   
the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank,

258

Yet when it came time for Murray to speak at Middlebury, dozens of   
students stood up and turned their backs to him while chanting things like   
“Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Charles Murray go away!” (quoted in Seelye   
2017).5 As this went on, Middlebury professor Allison Stanger, a liberal   
who had been invited to debate Murray after his talk, implored, “Can you   
just listen for one minute,” noting that she had spent time preparing dif-ficult questions. “No,” the students replied (quoted in Beinart 2017)  
. With Murray unable to give the talk, the organizers moved the partici-pants to a secret location where it would be broadcast for those who   
wanted to hear it. The protesters discovered the location, though, and   
when the talk was finished surrounded the participants as they tried to   
leave. They assaulted Stanger, who later went to the hospital and received   
a neck brace, and when Murray, Stanger, and others got into a car, the   
protesters jumped on the hood and made the car rock back and forth.   
Once Murray and Stanger got away, they ended up leaving town after   
learning the students also planned to disrupt their planned dinner at a   
local restaurant (Beinart 2017; Seelye 2017)

258

Similar treatment awaited another conservative scholar when she came   
to speak at Claremont McKenna College. Heather Mac Donald, who is   
affiliated with the Manhattan Institute think tank, is a critic of the Black   
L  
ives

258

A number of students at Claremont McKenna and the other nearby   
Claremont colleges, though, did not believe Mac Donald’s arguments   
were worth reckoning with. They characterized her views as denying that   
blacks have a right to exist, and they called her a “fascist, a white suprema-c  
ist, a warhawk, a transphobe, a queerphobe, \[and\] a classist … \[who is\] ignorant of interlocking systems of domination” (quoted in Friedersdorf

259

2  
3

259

2017).6 When it came time for her talk, 250 protesters blocked the   
entrance of the building where she was supposed to speak. Out of safety   
concerns she then spoke in a secret location to small number of people   
while the talk was live-streamed to a larger audience. Protesters found the   
new location and were waiting outside, but as Mac Donald explains, “An   
escape plan through the kitchen into an unmarked police van was devised.   
I was surrounded by about four cops. Protesters were sitting on the stoop   
outside the door … but we had taken them by surprise and we got through   
them” (quoted in Blume 2017)

259

A  
t this point it might still be tempting to think this kind of thing only affects certain kinds of speech or certain kinds of people. If it is not just   
right-wing provocateurs, maybe it is just conservatives, or just invited   
speakers, who are the targets. But remember from previous chapters that   
Yale students vilified Erika and Nicholas Christakis over an email Erika   
sent about Halloween costume policies. The Christakises were neither   
outsiders nor conservatives. Neither was Evergreen State College biology   
professor Bret Weinstein. Since the 1970s Evergreen had observed a tradi-tion called the “Day of Absence,” where nonwhite faculty and students   
would leave the campus and meet elsewhere as a symbolic act to show how   
valuable nonwhites are in the life of the college. In 2017, though, the   
organizers reversed this and asked white faculty and students to leave   
instead. Weinstein objected. “There is a huge difference,” he wrote,   
“between a group or coalition deciding to voluntarily absent themselves   
from a shared space to highlight their vital and under-appreciated roles   
and a group or coalition encouraging another group to go away.” The lat-ter, he said, “is an act of oppression in and of itself” (quoted in Weiss   
2017). About 50 student protesters confronted him and demanded he   
“stop supporting white supremacy” (quoted in Weiss 2017)  
, that he “stop telling people of color they’re fucking useless,” and that he “get the fuck   
out of here” (quoted in Dreher 2017b). When students asked Weinstein

260

for an explanation of his remarks, he asked, “May I answer that question,”   
only to receive an emphatic “No!” from the crowd (quoted in Dreher   
2017b). Weinstein left campus and held class elsewhere when police told   
him they could not ensure his safety, and the activists then put “Fire Bret”   
graffiti around campus and put the names and pictures of his students   
online (Weiss 2017). Shortly after all of that, Evergreen’s president,   
George Bridges, held a town hall meeting where he said he was “grateful   
to the courageous students who expressed their concerns” and for “this   
catalyst to expedite the work to which we are jointly committed” (quoted   
in Haller 2017; Weiss 2017).7

260

Note that what seems most dangerous is criticism of any of the mani-festations of victimhood culture or challenges to its core ideology.

260

This is   
perhaps the only thing Milo Yiannopoulos, Brett Weinstein, and the oth-ers we have talked about have in common with each other. It is also what   
they have in common with theologian Paul Griffiths of Duke Divinity   
School. When Professor Anathea Portier-Young sent out an email on   
behalf of the Faculty Diversity and Inclusion Standing Committee encour-aging faculty to attend the Racial Equity Institute Phase I Training, which   
she described as a first step in ensuring that Duke Divinity School becomes   
“an institution that is both equitable and anti-racist in its practices and   
culture,” Griffiths responded, describing the training as “a waste” and   
encouraging others not to attend: “It’ll be, I predict with confidence,   
intellectually flaccid: there’ll be bromides, clichés, and amen corner   
rah- rahs in plenty. When (if) it gets beyond that, its illiberal roots and   
totalitarian tendencies will show.” Griffiths encouraged faculty to focus   
instead on their mission as faculty of the Divinity School: “to think, read,   
write, and teach about the triune Lord of Christian confession” (quoted in   
Dreher 2017a)

260

Elaine Heath, Dean of the Duke Divinity School, responded with a   
mass email chastising Griffiths for making “disparaging statements—  
including arguments ad hominem—in order to humiliate or undermine   
individual colleagues or groups of colleagues” he disagreed with. “The use   
of mass emails,” she added, “to express racism, sexism, or other forms of

261

2  
3

261

bigotry is offensive and unacceptable, especially in a Christian institution.”   
Another professor responded to defend Griffiths, noting that Griffiths was   
only saying publicly what others were saying privately and disputing   
Heath’s claim that Griffiths had expressed “racism, sexism, or other forms   
of bigotry.” “To suggest anything of the sort,” he said, “strikes me as   
either gravely imperceptive or as intellectually dishonest” (quoted in   
Dreher 2017a). Heath did not retract her claims, though, and instead   
summoned Griffiths to a meeting so that she could talk with him about   
professional conduct. When they were unable to agree on the terms of the   
meeting, Heath banned Griffiths from faculty meetings and from access to   
travel funds (Dreher 2017a). Meanwhile Portier-Young, the professor   
w  
ho had sent out the email about the training session, filed a complaint against Griffiths with the university’s Office of Institutional Equity on the   
basis that he had engaged in racist and sexist speech that created a hostile   
work environment. Soon afterward Griffiths resigned from his position   
with Duke (Beyer 2017)

261

T  
hough speech that challenges the ideals and practices of victimhood culture provokes activists the most, they may punish professors for other   
kinds of speech as well. Even those who identify with the activists are not   
immune. Certainly Mary Spellman, Dean of Students at Claremont   
McKenna, had no idea she would cause offense when she wrote to thank   
a student for sharing her article. The student, Lissette Espinosa, had writ-ten an op-ed about her struggles as a working-class Mexican–American   
s  
tudent. When Espinosa emailed the op-ed to Spellman, Spellman responded by asking if Espinosa would like to meet with her some time.   
“We have a lot to do as a college and a community,” Spellman wrote, add-ing that the issues the student raised were important to her and to her   
staff, and that they were “working on how we can better serve students,   
especially those who do not fit our CMC \[Claremont McKenna College\]   
mold” (quoted in Shire 2015). That she was agreeing with Espinosa was   
clear, but student activists treated the part about fitting the mold not as   
clumsy phrasing but as if Spellman were declaring Espinosa did not belong   
at the college. Soon there were protests and hunger strikes, and Dean   
Spellman eventually resigned.

Some students had   
begun writing the latter phrase on each other’s white boards, and the resi-dential advisors warned, “Any negative remarks regarding ‘Harambe’ will   
be seen as a direct attack to our campus’s African American community.”   
They went on to say that phrases or hashtags that “encourage the exposi-tion of body parts runs the risk of being reported as a Title IX incident”   
(quoted in Soave 2016). One reason for their concern was that Harambe,  
a Swahili word, was also the name of the university’s African and African–  
American residential community, but Harambe jokes also worried admin-istrators at Clemson University, where this was not a factor. There an   
administrator sent a message to resident advisors saying, “Due to an inci-dent that happened earlier this week, we are no longer allowing any refer-ence to Harambe … to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or   
windows.”

Note: literally racist. You’re the only one’s here comparing black people to monkeys lol

That nothing is ever safe does not mean that everything results in pun-i  
shment. It should be clear by now that a defining characteristic of campus censorship is its arbitrariness.

Note: ah yes allow Cora select few authority figures to decide what is and isn’t hate speech. That surely won’t be abused

universities are making it   
easier for students to report not just their professors, but also their fellow   
students whenever they say anything that offends them.

Note: take this is to account with injustice collecting

In addition to the   
Title IX bureaucracy, which as we discussed in Chap. 4, is partly a response   
to guidance from the US government, universities have begun setting up   
various kinds of bias response teams. More than 200 colleges and universi-t  
ies now have them, and usually they allow anyone on campus to make a report about anyone else (FIRE 2017). At the University of California,   
Santa Cruz, for example, a single poster advertising a “mafia” game was   
removed after a student filed a bias incident claim. The student said the   
poster was offensive to her as an Italian American and “could result in the   
h  
arassment of Italian American students on campus.” At the University of Michigan, someone reported a “phallic snow object” (quoted in Snyder   
and Khalid 2016). At Colby College the bias response team investigated a   
c  
omplaint about someone having a luau, and another about someone who used the phrase “on the other hand,” which the complainant character-ized as “ableist” (Owens 2017). At the University of Oregon the bias   
response team received complaints about a newspaper not giving enough   
c  
overage to ethnic minorities and transgender students, about students “expressing anger about oppression,” about a faculty member giving   
“relationship advice that was sexist and heterosexist,” about a professor   
belittling a student’s request for trigger warnings, and about an email mar-keting “a program by praising Columbus and Lewis & Clark as role   
models” (quoted in Steinbaugh 2016).

Note: this is what happens when you rely on subjective criteria for censorship. It always devolves into some censorship frenzy

264

And at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville someone reported three students for dressing up as the Three   
Blind Mice, since people might have thought the costumes were mocking   
people with disabilities (FIRE 2017)

Note: key word *thought* as in interpret

Most of the bias incidents are the usual fare: complaints about words and   
behaviors seen by the complainant as offensive in some way to one or more   
victim groups. These arise from the victimhood culture embraced by campus   
radicals, but some complaints come from the right. These are complaints

that the campus activists are the ones who are offensive. At Cornell University   
someone reported a professor for comparing police to terrorists, and some-one else reported the student government for its attempts to make Cornell   
a sanctuary campus. At Appalachian State University someone reported a   
student activist for, among other offenses, hating white men and for express-ing disregard for the lives of police officers. And at John Carroll University   
someone reported the African American Alliance because their protest made   
white students uncomfortable (FIRE 2017)

The more serious threats from the right, though, come from outside   
the university. Jonathan Haidt describes the basic pattern. First, a “left- wing professor says something provocative (and sometimes truly inflam-matory),” then “right-wing media sites … pick up the story and report it   
in a way designed to cause maximum outrage,” then many readers and   
viewers “demand the university fire the professor,” with some of them   
writing “racist and sexist social media posts” or even “rape threats and   
death threats,” and then the university’s administration, “paralyzed by the   
public relations crisis,” condemns the professor, and if the professor is not   
tenured, puts “him or her ‘on leave’ in order to begin the termination   
process” (Haidt 2017). Thus, when Katherine Dettwyler, an anthropology   
lecturer at the University of Delaware, gained attention after writing that   
American college student Otto Warmbier, who had recently died from his   
imprisonment and abuse by the North Korean government, “got exactly   
what he deserved,” the university put out a statement saying her opinions   
did not reflect their values and that she would not be teaching there in the   
future (Quintana 2017; Spada 2017). And when Johnny Eric Williams, a   
sociology professor at Trinity College, shared an article called “Let Them   
Fucking Die,” which argued that the white congressmen injured by a   
shooter in June 2017 should have been left to die, and followed it up with   
Facebook posts saying things such as, “The time is now to confront these   
inhuman assholes and end this now,” Trinity’s president quickly announced   
that Williams would be put on leave (Gockowski 2017; Quintana 2017).   
Here the statements drawing public ire and university censorship are state-ments that campus activists would certainly call hate speech if they were   
directed toward members of victim groups. Campus victimhood culture   
accepts such speech when directed at oppressors, and sometimes praises it,

I  
n the spring of 2016 the appearance of messages in chalk on the sidewalks of Emory University caused alarm. Emory’s president met with a group of   
concerned students and emailed the university community about it after-ward. He assured the students he would review security footage to deter-mine the identity of the chalkers, and “if they’re students,” he said, “they   
will go through the conduct violation process.” He also said that because   
of the chalkings the university would refine its “bias incident and response   
process.” And what were the chalked messages that led to all of this?   
“Trump” and “Trump 2016” (Snyder and Khalid 2016)  
. The attention the Emory incident received then led conservative students throughout   
the country to put pro-Trump messages in chalk on their campuses. They   
called it The Chalkening (LaChance 2016). The response was as expected.   
The Hate Response Team at the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse, for   
example, called the messages “discriminatory” and “hostile” (quoted in   
Owens 2017)

Most people   
have wanted to ban speech that offends them and allow speech that does   
not. This is what the adherents of victimhood culture want, and increas-ingly, it may be what many of their opponents want too. The attacks on   
speech emanating from campus victimhood culture might increasingly be   
met with counterattacks from ideological enemies rather than defenders of   
free speech. Here again, opposition leads to imitation. We have seen that   
conservative students make reports of their own to the bias response teams   
and that members of the public often demand the firing of left-wing pro-fessors over offensive comments.

266

Outside of the univer-sity we have seen Trump supporters behaving much like the anti- Yiannapolous rioters in storming the stage during a performance of the   
Shakespeare play Julius Caesar that depicted a Trump-like Caesar being   
assassinated (Jenkins 2017).

The only opponents of victimhood in   
the larger society may end up being right-wingers who eschew dignity and   
are just as thin skinned and intolerant as the campus left.
