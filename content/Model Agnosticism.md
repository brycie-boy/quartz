## Model Agnosticism  #üß†

Model Agnosticism refers to an attitude of mind which applies the agnostic principle not just to the "God" concept but to ideas of all sorts in all areas of thought and ideology. The agnostic principle refuses total belief or total denial and regards models as tools to be used where appropriate and replaced by other models where not appropriate. It does not regard any models as more "profound" than any other models, but asks only how a model serves, or fails to serve, those who use it. The agnostic principle is intended here in a broad existential or humanistic sense, and is not intended to be narrowly technical or philosophical only.
