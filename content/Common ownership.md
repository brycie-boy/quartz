## Common ownership

Common ownership refers to holding the assets of an organization, enterprise or community indivisibly rather than in the names of the individual members or groups of members as common property. Common ownership of the [means of production](Means%20of%20production.md) is a central goal of [communism](Communism.md). I believe it to stem from [the three wholesome roots](The%20three%20wholesome%20roots.md) and non-[clinging](Clinging.md).
