## Cognitive dissonance  #🧠 

Cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort experienced when one confronts information which is at variance with their personal [[reality tunnel]]. [[People become hypnotized by their views to avoid having to deal with doubt and uncertainty]]. The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein the individual tries to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.

They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance ([[rationalization]]) or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance ([[confirmation bias]]).
