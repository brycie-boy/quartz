## Cognitive dissonance  #üß†

Cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort experienced when one confronts information which is at variance with their personal [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md). [People become hypnotized by their views to avoid having to deal with doubt and uncertainty](People%20become%20hypnotized%20by%20their%20views%20to%20avoid%20having%20to%20deal%20with%20doubt%20and%20uncertainty.md). The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein the individual tries to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.

They tend to make changes to¬†justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance ([rationalization](Rationalization.md)) or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance ([confirmation bias](Confirmation%20bias.md)).
