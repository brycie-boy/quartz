## Environmental enrichment

Environmental enrichment is the stimulation of the [brain](Brain.md) by its physical and social surroundings. It was formalized as a way to test use-dependent plasticity: [Synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened through life experiences and frequency of use](Synaptic%20connections%20are%20strengthened%20or%20weakened%20through%20life%20experiences%20and%20frequency%20of%20use.md).
