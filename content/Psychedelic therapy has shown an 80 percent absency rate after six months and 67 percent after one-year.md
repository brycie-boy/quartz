## Psychedelic therapy has shown an 80 percent absency rate after six months and 67 percent after one-year

Several volunteers have confirmed that [psychedelics capacity to help people entertain new ideas may allow them create new stories of who they are](Psychedelics%20capacity%20to%20help%20people%20entertain%20new%20ideas%20may%20allow%20them%20create%20new%20stories%20of%20who%20they%20are.md) and have described achieving a new distance on their own lives, a vantage from which matters that had once seemed daunting now seemed smaller and more manageable, including their [addiction](Addiction.md)s. It sounded as though the [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md) experience had given many of them an overview effect on the scenes of their own lives, making possible a shift in worldview and priorities that allowed them to let go of old [habit](Habit.md)s, sometimes with remarkable ease. 

A smoking cessation pilot study involving [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s was directed by [Matthew Johnson](), a prot√©g√© of [Roland Griffith]()s‚Äôs at [Johns Hopkins](), where the study took place. Johnson is a psychologist in his early forties who, like Griffiths, trained as a behaviorist, studying [operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md). Johnson worked on the lab‚Äôs early [psilocybin]() studies, serving as a guide for several dozen sessions and helping to crunch the data, before launching a study of his own in 2009. The smoking study gave fifteen volunteer smokers who were trying to quit several sessions of [cognitive behavioral therapy](Cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy.md) followed by two or three doses of [psilocybin](). A so-called open-label study, there was no placebo, so they all knew they were getting the drug. The study was tiny and not randomized, but the results were nevertheless striking, especially when you consider that smoking is one of the most difficult [addiction](Addiction.md)s to break. Six months after their psychedelic sessions, 80 percent of the volunteers were confirmed as abstinent; at the one-year mark, that figure had fallen to 67 percent, which is still a better rate of success than the best treatment now available.
