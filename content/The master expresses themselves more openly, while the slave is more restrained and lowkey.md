## The master expresses themselves more openly, while the slave is more restrained and lowkey # 

While the [[Master morality|noble]] live in trust and openness with themselves, the [[Slave Morality|slave]] is not honest or straightforward with themselves. The [[Slave Morality|slave]] tends to stay lowkey. They understand how to keep silent, how not to forget, how to wait, and how to be provisionally self-deprecating and humble. It is inevitable that these people of [[resentment]] will eventually become more clever than any noble people. They cannot conquer immediately, so they develop [[resentment]] can only plot and scheme. They will also have far more honor for cleverness. 

Wheres with [[Master morality|noble people]] cleverness can easily acquire a subtle flavor of luxury and subtlety—for here it is far less essential than the perfect functioning of the regulating unconscious instincts or even than a certain imprudence, perhaps a bold recklessness whether in the face of danger or of the enemy, or that enthusiastic impulsiveness in anger, love, reverence, gratitude, and revenge by which [[Master morality|noble people]] have at all times recognized one another. If [[Resentment]] were to appear in the [[Master morality|noble]], then it would be expressed immediately, and therefore does not slowly poison: on the other hand, it may fail to appear at all in weak and impotent.
