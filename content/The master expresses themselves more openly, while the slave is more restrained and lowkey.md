## The master expresses themselves more openly, while the slave is more restrained and lowkey

While the [noble](Master%20morality.md) live in trust and openness with themselves, the [slave](Slave%20Morality.md) is not honest or straightforward with themselves. The [slave](Slave%20Morality.md) tends to stay lowkey. They understand how to keep silent, how not to forget, how to wait, and how to be provisionally self-deprecating and humble. It is inevitable that these people of [resentment](Resentment.md) will eventually become more clever than any noble people. They cannot conquer immediately, so they develop [resentment](Resentment.md) can only plot and scheme. They will also have far more honor for cleverness. 

Wheres with [noble people](Master%20morality.md) cleverness can easily acquire a subtle flavor of luxury and subtlety—for here it is far less essential than the perfect functioning of the regulating unconscious instincts or even than a certain imprudence, perhaps a bold recklessness whether in the face of danger or of the enemy, or that enthusiastic impulsiveness in anger, love, reverence, gratitude, and revenge by which [noble people](Master%20morality.md) have at all times recognized one another. If [Resentment](Resentment.md) were to appear in the [noble](Master%20morality.md), then it would be expressed immediately, and therefore does not slowly poison: on the other hand, it may fail to appear at all in weak and impotent.
