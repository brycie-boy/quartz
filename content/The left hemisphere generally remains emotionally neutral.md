## The left hemisphere generally remains emotionally neutral

[The right hemisphere is responsible for emotional expression](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20emotional%20expression.md), and [the right hemisphere is capable of identifying emotional expression](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20capable%20of%20identifying%20emotional%20expression.md). But as for the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), though it is involved with emotion, it is by comparison with the [right](Right%20hemisphere.md), relatively emotionally neutral, something which is evidenced by its affinity for ‚Äònon-emotional‚Äô, abstract paintings. Emotional stimuli are not incorporated into mood‚Äînot adopted personally‚Äîwhen offered to the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) rather than the [right](Right%20hemisphere.md). The whole business seems more conscious, more willed, more deliberate, and that is in keeping with the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)'s need to influence and manipulate, as well as its role in re-presenting experience ([The left hemisphere filters and represents experience according to its preconfigured system of classification, and the right attends to everything outside of this process without preconceptions](The%20left%20hemisphere%20filters%20and%20represents%20experience%20according%20to%20its%20preconfigured%20system%20of%20classification,%20and%20the%20right%20attends%20to%20everything%20outside%20of%20this%20process%20without%20preconceptions.md)). In [alexithymia](), a condition of lack of awareness or capacity to express emotional arousal in words, the problem arises from an inability of the emotionally aware [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), which can be shown to be experiencing emotional arousal, to communicate it to the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md).
