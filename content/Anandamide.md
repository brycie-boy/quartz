## Anandamide

Anandamide is a [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) that binds to the [endocannabinoid]() [CB1 receptor]()s, the same [receptor](Receptor.md)s that the psychoactive compound [THC]() in [cannabis]() acts on. It seems to play a role in the identification of positive and negative interpretation of environment and setting and plays a role in the interpretation of stimulus; specifically, optimism and pessimism in the presence of an ambiguous cue. Amamdamide is injected directly into the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) enhances the pleasurable responses of rats to a rewarding sucrose taste, and enhances food intake as well.
