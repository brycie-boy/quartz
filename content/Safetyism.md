## Safetyism # 

Safetyism is a term coined by psychologists [[Greg Lukianoff]] and [[Jonathan Haidt]] that refers to a culture or belief system in which safety has become a sacred value, which means that people engage in [[groupthink]]  and become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. “Safety” trumps everything else, no matter how unlikely or trivial the potential danger. [[Going into the twenty-first the concept of safety had expanded from physical safety to include emotional safety]]. However, [[we must expose ourselves to trauma in order to overcome our aversion toward it]]. A culture that allows the concept of “safety” to [[Concept creep|creep]] so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experiences embedded in daily life that they need in order to become strong and healthy.
