## Right hemisphere deficits result in difficulty with perceiving irregular smoothly curved surfaces

[The right hemisphere allows for the sense of spatial depth, whereas the left understands depth categorically, i.e. above, below](The%20right%20hemisphere%20allows%20for%20the%20sense%20of%20spatial%20depth,%20whereas%20the%20left%20understands%20depth%20categorically,%20i.e.%20above,%20below.md). [Right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) deficits cause difficulty in dealing with irregular smoothly curved surfaces, such as are characteristic of living things, in three dimensions, even though the capacity to deal with a predictable rectilinear 3D object like a cube is spared. It has been suggested that this problem in dealing with curved volumes may underlie [prosopagnosia](), and it might be a contributing factor. One of the features Bodamer's ‚ÄòPatient S‚Äô described was, after all, the lack of depth, the reduction of the face to a ‚Äòwhite oval plate‚Äô.
