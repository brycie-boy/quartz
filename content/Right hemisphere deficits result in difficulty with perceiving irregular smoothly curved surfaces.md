## Right hemisphere deficits result in difficulty with perceiving irregular smoothly curved surfaces  # 

[[The right hemisphere allows for the sense of spatial depth, whereas the left understands depth categorically, i.e. above, below]]. [[Right hemisphere]] deficits cause difficulty in dealing with irregular smoothly curved surfaces, such as are characteristic of living things, in three dimensions, even though the capacity to deal with a predictable rectilinear 3D object like a cube is spared. It has been suggested that this problem in dealing with curved volumes may underlie [[prosopagnosia]], and it might be a contributing factor. One of the features Bodamer's ‘Patient S’ described was, after all, the lack of depth, the reduction of the face to a ‘white oval plate’.
