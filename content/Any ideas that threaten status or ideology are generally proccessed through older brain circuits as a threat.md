## Any ideas that threaten status or ideology are generally proccessed through older brain circuits as a threat # 

The [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] circuit also contains the pack’s status programs or pecking order. Working in tandem with [[Limbic system]] survival anxieties, it is always able to pervert the functioning of the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]]. Whatever threatens loss of status, and whatever invades one’s “space” (including one’s ideological “head space”), is a threat to the average domesticated primate. Thus, if a poor man has one status prop in his life—“I’m a white man, not a goddam nigger” or “I’m normal, not a goddam faggot” or whatever—any attempt to preach tolerance, common humanity, relativism, etc. is not processed through the semantic circuit but through the [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]], and is rejected as an attack on status (ego, social role).
