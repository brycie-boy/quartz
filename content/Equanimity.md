## Equanimity

Equanimity is decribed a balanced reaction to joy and misery which protects one from agitation. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. [The¬†Buddha]()¬†described a mind filled with equanimity as "abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will." Thus equanimity prevents [unwholesome kamma](Unwholesome%20kamma.md).

Equanimity can also be cultivated through [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) practice. [Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) trains people to face all extreme states of mind or whatever arises at the present moment without [clinging](Clinging.md).
