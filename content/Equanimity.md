## Equanimity  # 

Equanimity is decribed a balanced reaction to [[pleasure]] and pain which protects one from agitation. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. [[The Buddha]] described a mind filled with equanimity as "abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will," thus equanimity helps prevent [[unwholesome kamma]].

Equanimity can also be cultivated through [[mindfulness]] practice. [[Mindfulness]] trains people to face all extreme states of mind or whatever arises at the present moment without [[clinging]].
