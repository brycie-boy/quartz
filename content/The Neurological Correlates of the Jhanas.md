### Annotations

- It will be very helpful if you read this article on [Wanting and Liking](https://web.archive.org/web/20210116035202/http://leighb.com/Seeking__How_the_brain_hard_wires_us_to_love_Google__Twitter__and_texting__And_why_that_s_dangerous.htm) by Emily Yoffe at Slate Magazine before studying the chart below

-   There are two mesolimbic dopamine systems: the [substantia nigra](https://web.archive.org/web/20210116035202/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantia_nigra) (wanting) system and the [ventral tegmental](https://web.archive.org/web/20210116035202/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventral_tegmental_area) (liking) system.

-   sense desire = _kamachanda_ = activation of the dopamine-based wanting system

-   rapture = _piti_ = activation of the dopamine-based liking system (housed in the Nucleus Accumbens) which generates norepinephrine which gives rise to the "symptoms" of piti

-   happiness = _sukha_ = activation of the opioid-based liking system (also housed in the Nucleus Accumbens)
