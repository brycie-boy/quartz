## Magick # 

Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will. To take an example from [[Aleister Crowley]]:

> "It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my knowledge. I therefore take "magical weapons," pen, ink, and paper; I write "incantations"-these sentences-in the "magical language" i.e., that which is understood by people I wish to instruct. I call forth "spirits" such as printers, publishers, booksellers, and so forth, and constrain them to convey my message to those people. The composition and distribution is thus an act of-MAGICK-by which I cause Changes to take place in conformity with my Will."

Any required Change may be effected by application of the proper kind and degree of Force in the proper manner through the proper medium to the proper object. Per Crowley: 

> "I wish to prepare an ounce of Chloride of Gold. I must take the right kind of acid, nitre-hydrochloric and no other, in sufficient quantity and of adequate strength, and place it, in a vessel which will not break, leak or corrode, in such a manner as will not produce undesirable results, with the necessary quantity of Gold, and so forth. Every Change has its own conditions. In the present state of our knowledge and power some changes are not possible in practice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance, or transform lead into tin, or create men from mushrooms. But it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature; and the conditions are covered by the above postulate"

Every intentional act is a Magickal Act. By "intentional" is meant ''willed." But even unintentional acts so seeming are not truly so. Thus, breathing is an act of the Will-to-live. Crowley states: "In one sense Magick may be defined as the name given to Science by the vulgar." Every successful act has conformed to the postulate. Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postulate have not been fulfilled. Per Crowley: 

> "There may be failure to understand the case; as when a doctor makes a wrong diagnosis, and his treatment injures his patient. There may be failure to apply the right kind of force, as when a rustic tries to blow out an electric light. There may be failure to apply the right degree of force, as when a wrestler has his hold broken.There may be failure to apply the force in the right manner, as when one presents a cheque at the wrong window of the Bank ... The force may be applied to an unsuitable object, as when one tries to crack a stone, thinking it a nut."

The first requisite for causing any change is thorough qualitative and quantitative understanding of the conditions. The second requisite of causing any change is the practical ability to set in right motion the necessary forces. For example, a banker may have a perfect grasp of a given situation, yet lack the quality of decision, or the assets, necessary to take advantage of it.
