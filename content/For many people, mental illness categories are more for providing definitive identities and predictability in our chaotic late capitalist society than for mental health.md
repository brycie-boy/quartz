## For many people, mental illness categories are more for providing definitive identities and predictability in our chaotic late capitalist society than for mental health # 

[[Capitalism needs people who can quickly jump from one identity the next]]. What BuzzFeed popularized we now have perfected and enforced amongst each other, no help from a media executive is needed any longer. Every day on the internet we are subjected to myriad memes about mental health: If you relate to these tweets you must have [[ADHD]], right? [[People become hypnotized by their views to avoid having to deal with doubt and uncertainty]], and or many people, these memes, and their furor over people who disagree with them, are not really about mental health, they‚Äôre about establishing predictability and enforcing identity categories that help define us in this era of late [[capitalism]] when everything feels completely out of control, especially as our lives are increasingly dominated by this vast categorization and surveillance machine we call the internet.
