## Normative influence # 

Normative influence is a type of social influence which involves changes in behavior that are deemed necessary in order to fit in a particular group. The need for a positive relationship with the people around us and aversion to conflict leads to [[conformity]]. This fact often leads to people exhibiting public compliance—but not necessarily private acceptance—of the group's [[social norms]] in order to be accepted by the group.
