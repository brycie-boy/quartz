## Normative influence

Normative influence is a type of social influence which involves changes in behavior that are deemed necessary in order to fit in a particular group. The need for a positive relationship with the people around us and aversion to conflict leads to [conformity](Conformity.md). This fact often leads to people exhibiting public compliance‚Äîbut not necessarily private acceptance‚Äîof the group's [social norms](Social%20norms.md) in order to be accepted by the group.
