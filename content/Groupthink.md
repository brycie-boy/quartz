## Groupthink #🧠 

Groupthink is a psychological phenomena that occurs when a [[fundamentalism]] overtakes a group and the desire for harmony and [[conformity]] in the group results in an irrational and dysfunctional decision making outcome. The desire for cohesiveness in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs. This causes the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical examination.

Groupthink requires individuals to avoid raising controversial issues or alternative solutions, and there is loss of individual creativity, uniqueness and independent thinking. Direct pressure to conform is often placed on members who pose questions, and those who question the group are often seen as disloyal or traitorous. Members of a group may feel under peer pressure to go along with the crowd and [[Self-censorship|seif-censor]].
