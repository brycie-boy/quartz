## Groupthink

Groupthink is a psychological phenomena that occurs when [fundamentalism](Fundamentalism.md) overtakes a group and the desire for harmony and [conformity](Conformity.md) in the group results in an irrational and dysfunctional decision making outcome. Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs. This causes the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation.
