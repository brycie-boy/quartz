## Amphetamines are known to induce psychotic and manic episodes # 

Even before the prescribing of [[Ritalin]] took hold, it was well known that [[amphetamine]]s could stir [[psychosis|psychotic]] and [[mania|manic]] episodes. Indeed, [[amphetamine]]s did this with such regularity that psychiatric researchers pointed to this effect as evidence supporting the [[dopamine]] hypothesis of [[schizophrenia]]. [[Amphetamine]]s upped [[dopamine]] levels in the [[brain]], suggesting that [[psychosis]] was caused by too much of this [[neurotransmitter]] ([[An overabundance of dopamine in schizophrenics has yet to be found]]). In 1974, [[David Janowsky]], a physician at the University of California at San Diego School of Medicine, tested this hypothesis by giving three [[dopamine]]-elevating agents‚Äîd-amphetamine, l-amphetamine, and [[Ritalin]]‚Äîto his [[schizophrenia]] patients. While all three drugs made them more psychotic, [[Ritalin]] turned out to be tops in this regard, doubling the severity of their symptoms.
