## Slave Morality  # 

Slave Morality is the ethics of the [[friendly weakness]] and [[hostile weakness]] types. It is the ethics of a bitter lower class. Rooted in [[resentment]] toward the ruling classes, slave morality inverts [[master morality]] and turns qualities such as weakness, impotency, powerlessness, low-status, poverty, and suffering into virtues.
