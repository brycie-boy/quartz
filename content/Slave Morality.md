## Slave Morality

Slave Morality is the ethics of the [friendly weakness](Friendly%20weakness.md) and [hostile weakness](Hostile%20weakness.md) types. It is the ethics of a bitter lower class. Rooted in [resentment](Resentment.md) toward the ruling classes, slave morality inverts [master morality](Master%20morality.md) and turns qualities such as weakness, impotency, powerlessness, low-status, poverty, and suffering into virtues.
