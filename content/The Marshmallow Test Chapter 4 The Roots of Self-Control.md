THE “STRANGE SITUATION”

51

Waiting for marshmallows in the Bing Surprise Room may have been torture for four- and five-year-olds, but it was even tougher for an 18-month-old to have to wait for Mom to return after she had walked out of the little room at the Barnard Toddler Center and left her child alone with a stranger (a Barnard College volunteer) and some toys on the floor. Brief separations early in life are stresses that every child has to endure when the primary caretaker, usually the mother, begins to disappear, hopefully soon to return. By the middle of the second year of life, toddlers already differ greatly in how anxiously or securely or ambivalently attached they are to their primary caretakers. What they do during such separations and reunions allows a peek into the quality of their relationships and their coping skills early in life.

52

Mary Ainsworth designed the “Strange Situation” as a way to observe this relationship. Ainsworth was a student of John Bowlby, the highly influential British psychologist who, beginning in the 1930s, studied the effects of children’s early-life attachment experiences, especially the impact of separation from their primary caregivers (an all-too-common, stressful experience in wartime). The Strange Situation simulates a brief maternal disappearance and reunion under controlled, benign conditions—Mom can come to the rescue quickly if her child’s distress, expressed by heartbreaking crying or desperate pounding on the door, becomes excessive. The experiment plays out in three carefully scripted stages.

52

First, during Free Play, mother and child (“Benjamin” in this example) are left alone in the room together for five minutes to “play as you would at home.”

Second, in the Separation episode, the school’s director calls the mother out of the room, leaving Benjamin alone for 2 minutes with an undergraduate volunteer. Benjamin has previously seen or interacted with the volunteer in the presence of his mother for about 17 minutes. The volunteer remains silent during the separation unless Benjamin shows signs of distress, in which case she briefly reassures him that “mommies come back.”

Third, during Reunion, right after the 2-minute separation, the mother reenters and picks Benjamin up. The volunteer leaves unobtrusively, and mother and child play together for 3 minutes.

53

In 1998, my student Anita Sethi wondered whether the 18-month-old’s actions during separation predicted what he did three years later while waiting for his two marshmallows. To test this idea, we began at the Barnard Toddler Center where we set up the Strange Situation and video-recorded everything that happened during each stage. We noted the child’s behavior during every ten-second frame—for example, whether he played or explored at a distance from the mother, distracted himself during her absence by looking at or playing with a toy, or engaged with the stranger. We also recorded his emotional expressions and any negative affect (crying, looking sad). The mother’s spontaneous behavior was also coded in equal detail, including her attempts to initiate interaction with her child, her intrusions into his play or attempts to direct it, and her disregard of his cues. “Maternal control”—really overcontrol and insensitivity to the child’s needs—was rated, based on such cues as the mother’s facial expression, vocal expression, position in relation to the child, amount of physical contact, expression of affection, and turn taking (sharing).

54

Toddlers who managed to distract themselves from Mom’s absence by playing with the toys, exploring the room, or engaging with the stranger avoided the intense distress experienced by those who could not tear themselves away from the door and quickly dissolved into tears. The toddler’s stress during the mother’s 2-minute absence escalated with every second of delay. That last stretch of 30 seconds must have felt endless, and toddlers’ behavior during those toughest seconds proved to be especially diagnostic: it predicted, far from perfectly but much beyond chance, what they would do when taking the Marshmallow Test in preschool. Specifically, the toddlers who spent those last 30 seconds of separation in the Strange Situation distracting themselves from Mom’s absence became the ones who at age five waited longer for their treats and distracted themselves more effectively during the Marshmallow Test. In contrast, the toddlers who had been unable to activate the necessary distraction strategies were also unable to do so when waiting for their treats three years later and rang the bell sooner. These results underscore the importance of regulating attention to control and cool down stress, beginning early in life.

THE VULNERABLE ROOTS

54

At birth, infants are controlled almost completely by their internal state at each moment and by caregivers on whom they depend. In the infant’s first few months outside the womb, soothing, rocking, feeding, and cuddling become a major job for caregivers, night and day. How lovingly and caringly infants are nurtured, or how cruelly and coldly they are neglected or abused, is inscribed in their brains and changes who they become. It is critical to keep infants’ stress levels from becoming chronically activated and to promote the formation of close, warm attachments so the babies feel secure and safe.

55

The plasticity of the brain, especially in the first year of life, makes infants highly vulnerable to damage in their key neural systems if they have extremely adverse experiences, such as severe maltreatment or uncaring institutional rearing. Surprisingly, even much more moderate environmental stressors, such as exposure to persistent, albeit nonphysical, conflict between parents, may take a serious toll. In one study, while infants age 6 to 12 months were sleeping, their brains were scanned by fMRI. When they heard very angry-sounding speech while sleeping, the babies living with parents who had persistent conflicts, compared with those in less conflict-filled homes, had higher activation in the brain areas that regulate emotion and stress. Findings like these suggest that even relatively moderate stressors from the social environment during critical periods of development are registered in the hot system.

55

Within a few months of birth, caregivers can begin to switch their infants’ attention away from feelings of distress and toward activities that interest them, and in time this helps their babies learn to self-distract to calm themselves. At the neural level, babies begin to develop the midfrontal area of the brain as an attention-control system for cooling and regulating their negative emotions. If all goes well, they become less reflexive, more reflective, less hot, more cool, and able to express their own goals, feelings, and intentions appropriately.

56

Discussing this process, Michael Posner and Mary Rothbart, two pioneers in the field of self-regulation development, say, “Children who at four months of age look at all the stimuli presented return to the lab a year and a half later with their own agenda. It is hard to get them to attend to our displays because their own plans take precedence. After making heroic efforts we can only shake our heads and mumble that they have a mind of their own” (emphasis mine).

56

As parents know, the second birthday is likely to come at around the time of the child’s unwritten declaration of independence. In its early revolutionary phases, this striving for independence makes life challenging (to put it gently) for caregivers. Around the age of two to three years, children begin to be able to exert control over their thoughts, feelings, and actions, and this skill becomes increasingly visible during the fourth and fifth years of life. It is critical for success in the Marshmallow Test, as well as for adapting to school and beyond.

57

By age three, children can usually begin to make some purposeful choices, regulate their attention more flexibly, and inhibit impulses that would distract them from their goal. For example, studies by Stephanie Carlson and her colleagues at the University of Minnesota show that these children can manage to follow two simple rules—like “If it’s blue, put it here, but if it’s red, put it there”—long enough to reach their goal, often verbalizing self-instructions to help them figure out what they have to do. While impressive, these skills remain limited in the third year, but children make great strides in the following two years. By the time they reach their fifth birthday, their minds have become wonderfully sophisticated. There are large individual differences, of course, but many five-year-olds can understand and follow complex rules, like “If it’s the color game, put the red square here, but if it’s the shape game, put the red square there.” While these skills are still in the early stages in the preschooler, by age seven, children’s attention-control skills and the underlying neural circuits are surprisingly similar to those of adults. The child’s experiences in the first half dozen years of life become roots for the ability to regulate impulses, exercise self-restraint, control the expression of emotions, and develop empathy, mindfulness, and conscience.

WHAT IF YOU HAVE A MOTHER LIKE PORTNOY HAD?

58

How does a mother’s parenting style influence the self-control strategies and attachment that her child develops? In Anita Sethi’s toddler study, described earlier, we measured the mother’s behavior in detail to assess her level and style of “maternal control” and her sensitivity to her child’s needs. Consider, for example, the mother who is overcontrolling and micromanaging, and who focuses mostly on her own needs rather than the child’s. This profile is captured famously in Philip Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint. As the protagonist looks back at his early childhood in New Jersey, he vividly recalls his mother’s well-intended but stifling overcontrol: the intrusiveness with which she inspected, evaluated, and corrected everything from his arithmetic to the condition of his socks, nails, neck, and every crevice of his body. And when young Portnoy, overstuffed with his mother’s loving cuisine, refuses to eat more pot roast, she persists, holding a long bread knife in her hand, and rhetorically asks: Does he want to become a skinny weakling, to be respected or ridiculed, “a man or a mouse”?

58

For a toddler who has Mrs. Portnoy for a mother, the path to achieving self-control skills may be very different from—indeed opposite—the one for the toddler with a less controlling mother. That is exactly what Anita found when she looked at the spontaneous interactions between the toddlers and their mothers when they were together in the room.

59

Toddlers who developed effective self-control skills by preschool generally responded to their highly controlling mother’s bids for attention not by sticking close to her, but by distracting and distancing themselves from her (more than three feet) to explore the room and play with the toys. Toddlers who distanced themselves from their controlling mothers, who literally moved away when she made approach overtures, were able to delay longer on the Marshmallow Test at age five. They succeeded by using attention-control strategies to cool their frustration, distracting themselves from the rewards and the bell in the same way that, as toddlers, they had distracted themselves from their controlling mothers. In contrast, the toddlers who had equally controlling mothers but who hung close when Mom made her bids for attention focused on the temptations when they took the Marshmallow Test and quickly rang the bell.

59

For toddlers whose mothers were less controlling, it was a different story. When those mothers tried to engage their toddlers, the ones who stayed close were the ones who showed more effective self-control and cooling strategies during the Marshmallow Test at age five. They distracted themselves strategically, focused less on the temptations, and waited longer to get their bigger rewards than children who, as toddlers, had distanced themselves from such mothers.

60

What are the implications? A toddler with a mother who is not excessively controlling and is sensitive to his needs has no reason to distance himself from her, and he stays close when she approaches in the Strange Situation to reduce his stress. But what if a child has a mother who is highly sensitive to what she wants but blind to what her child needs when he most needs it, and who tries to control his every move in ways that distress him? Anita’s results raise some questions to consider. It may not be a bad idea for the toddler to move a few feet away from his mom to play with the toys and explore the room. It may even help him develop the self-control cooling skills that he’ll need to get those two marshmallows when he is age five.

60

To examine these possibilities, Annie Bernier of the University of Montreal led a research team in 2010 that studied how mothers interacted with their children, aged 12 to 15 months, to see how those interactions influenced the development of self-control. The researchers carefully examined how the mothers engaged with their toddlers when they worked together on puzzles and other cognitive tasks. Then they tested the same children again at age 16 to 26 months. Bernier found that the children of mothers who had in the earlier study encouraged their toddlers’ autonomy by supporting their choices and sense of volition subsequently had the strongest cognitive and attention-control skills of the kind needed for success on the Marshmallow Test. This was true even when the researchers controlled for differences in the mothers’ cognitive ability and education. The message here is that parents who overcontrol their toddlers risk undermining the development of their children’s self-control skills, while those who support and encourage autonomy in problem-solving efforts are likely to maximize their children’s chances of coming home from preschool eager to tell them how they got their two marshmallows.
