## Brain scans show that those who defy authority opinion struggle to change opinion

[Brain scans show that those who defy the groups opinion will try to revise their memories while the brain tries to convince them otherwise](Brain%20scans%20show%20that%20those%20who%20defy%20the%20groups%20opinion%20will%20try%20to%20revise%20their%20memories%20while%20the%20brain%20tries%20to%20convince%20them%20otherwise.md), so what is the neurobiology of [obedience](obedience.md) to authority, when you‚Äôre being ordered to do something wrong? A similar mixture as with [conformity](Conformity.md), with the [ventromedial prefrontal cortex](Ventromedial%20prefrontal%20cortex.md) and the [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex](Dorsolateral%20prefrontal%20cortex.md) mud-wrestling, with indices of anxiety and [cortisol](Cortisol.md) showing up to push you towards [authority bias](Authority%20bias.md).
