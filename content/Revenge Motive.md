## Revenge Motive

The fact that [the more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world](The%20more%20certain%20of%20our%20views%20we%20become,%20the%20more%20we%20perceive%20ourselves%20to%20be%20victims%20of%20an%20impersonal%20world.md) is probably the reason why [Fredrich Neitzsche](), who understood the pathology from within, raged against denying the "real" universe entirely, and against what he called the Revenge Motive. If a man feels overwhelmed by the "real" universe, he will seek to destroy what oppresses him. And since we cannot get at the "real" universe, revenge must be directed at symbolic targets within our [Emic Reality](Emic%20Reality.md)s. The capacity for neurological self-criticism, or what Neitzsche calls the Will to Power, then becomes deflected into a Will to Destroy. Neitzsche here is describing the process by which we shirk responsibility. We seek revenge, but since we are only *reacting*, the "real" universe made us do it. Man as a reactive mechanism‚Äîthe [Materialists](Materialism.md) metaphor‚Äîis a man with a grudge. 

One of the most well known lines of verse from the 20th Century is from Alfred Edward Housman: "I, a stranger and afraid, In a world I never made." This is the self-image of modern humanity: [The Right Man](The%20Right%20Man.md) in particular, but also of the masses of ordinary men and women who have internalized the [Fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) [Materialist](Materialism.md) metaphor and have made it their [Idol](Idol.md).
