## Long-term administration of antidepressants in children show risk for the development of bipolar disorder # 

It is well established that [[antidepressant]]s can induce [[mania|manic]] episodes in adults, and naturally they have this effect on children, too. As early as 1992, when the prescribing of [[SSRI]]s to children was just getting started, University of Pittsburgh researchers reported that 23 percent of boys eight to nineteen years old treated with [[Prozac]] developed [[mania]] or [[mania|manic]]-like symptoms, and another 19 percent developed ‚Äúdrug-induced‚Äù hostility. In [[Eli Lilly]]‚Äôs first study of [[Prozac]] for [[depression]], 6 percent of the children treated with the drug suffered a [[mania|manic]] episode; none in the placebo group did. [[Luvox]], meanwhile, was reported to cause a 4 percent rate of [[mania]] in children under 18. In 2004, Yale University researchers assessed this risk of [[antidepressant]]-induced [[mania]] in young and old, and they found that it is highest in those under thirteen years of age.

The incidence rates just cited are from short-term trials; the risk rises when children and teenagers stay on [[antidepressant]]s for extended periods. In 1995, Harvard psychiatrists determined that 25 percent of children and adolescents diagnosed with [[depression]] convert to [[bipolar disorder]] within two to four years. ‚Äú[[Antidepressant]] treatment may well induce switching into [[mania]], rapid cycling or affective instability in the young, as it almost certainly does in adults,‚Äù they explained. Washington University‚Äôs [[Barbara Geller]] extended the follow-up period to ten years, and in her study, nearly half of prepubertal children treated for [[depression]] ended up [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]]. 

[[The symptoms of stimulant treatment for ADHD closely resemble those of bipolar disorder]], and [[juvenile bipolar disorder first arose in tandem with stimulant and antidepressant treatment in children]]. These findings give us our second mathematical equation for solving the bipolar epidemic: If 2 million children and adolescents are treated with [[SSRI]]s for [[depression]], this practice will create 500,000 to 1 million bipolar youth. We now have numbers that tell of an iatrogenic epidemic: 400,000 [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] children arriving via the [[ADHD]] doorway, and at least another half million through the [[antidepressant]] doorway.
