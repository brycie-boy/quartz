## Mindfulness can allow us to get over bad habits without congnitive effort

Dr. [Judson Brewer](), when working with his patients who were [addicted](Addiction.md) to smoking, would send them home with an admonition to pay close attention to their [operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md) triggers and to what it felt like when they did smoke. Many of his patients couldn't believe how bad smoking tasted. One of his patients knew cognitively that smoking was unhealthy, which was why they joined his [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) program. What they learned by being curious and attentive when they smoked was that smoking tasted horrible. This was an important distinction. They moved from [conceptual understanding](Conceptual%20understanding.md) to [Experiential understanding](Experiential%20understanding.md); from knowing that smoking was bad in their [brain](Brain.md)s to knowing it was bad in their bones. The spell of smoking was broken and thay had started to grow viscerally disenchanted with their behavior. Additionally, [psychedelics can help us get over bad habits without cognative effort by bringing us into a more mindful state](Psychedelics%20can%20help%20us%20get%20over%20bad%20habits%20without%20cognative%20effort%20by%20bringing%20us%20into%20a%20more%20mindful%20state.md).

This is what [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) is all about: seeing clearly what actually happens when we get caught up in our behaviors and becoming viscerally disenchanted with them. Over time, as we see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old [habit](Habit.md)s and adopt better ones. This is why [values can only be considered truly valid until one witnesses their value for themselves](Values%20can%20only%20be%20considered%20truly%20valid%20until%20one%20witnesses%20their%20value%20for%20themselves.md). [Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) pulls us out of mindlessness‚Äîthe state of brought about by the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), and one in which [addiction](Addiction.md)s and [habit](Habit.md)s flourish. [Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) is about getting close and personal with what what is occurring within our bodies and minds. It is a willingness to turn toward our experience rather than trying to just make our unpleasant [craving](Craving.md) go away as quickly as possible. 

[Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) contrasts with many modern techniques for behavioral control. With CBT and other related treatments, cognition is used to control behavior‚Äîhence the name cognitive behavioral therapy. Unfortunately, [stress causes the HPA axis to quite the prefrontal cortex by flooding it with dopamine and cortisol](Stress%20causes%20the%20HPA%20axis%20to%20quite%20the%20prefrontal%20cortex%20by%20flooding%20it%20with%20dopamine%20and%20cortisol.md), encouraging impulsivity. When the [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md) shuts off, the chance that we can slip back into our old [habit](Habit.md)s increases. This is why the disenchantment experienced by the patient is so important. Seeing what we really get from our [habit](Habit.md)s helps us understand them on a deeper intuitive level without needing to force our selves to hold back from them.
