## Exercise has been shown to increase neurogenesis

Gage went back to the [environmental enrichment](Environmental%20enrichment.md) model to test how [a newborn neuron must find something to do to survive](A%20newborn%20neuron%20must%20find%20something%20to%20do%20to%20survive.md). According to Gage: "just putting a running wheel in a cage had a profound effect on the number of cells that were born. Ironically, with running, the same percentage of cells die as in the control group ‚Äî it‚Äôs just that you have a bigger starting pool. But in order for a cell to survive and integrate, it has to fire its [axon](Axon.md).‚Äù Exercise promotes [neurogenesis](Neurogenesis.md), and the stimulation of [environmental enrichment](Environmental%20enrichment.md) helps those new [neuron](Neuron.md)s survive.
