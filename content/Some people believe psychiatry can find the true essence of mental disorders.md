## Some people believe psychiatry can find the true essence of mental disorders

One perspective on psychiatry comes form those [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) [materialists](Materialism.md) who have great faith in science to detect the true essence of things. For them, [mental disorder]()s will soon reveal their secrets through scientific study. This optimism was shared by most biological psychiatrists until about fifteen years ago but, except for a few diehards, is now rapidly fading away. Billions of research dollars have failed to produce convincing evidence that any [mental disorder]() is a discrete disease entity with a unitary cause. [An overabundance of dopamine in schizophrenics has yet to be found](An%20overabundance%20of%20dopamine%20in%20schizophrenics%20has%20yet%20to%20be%20found.md), and [a shortage of serotonin in the brain has not yet been found in depression patients](A%20shortage%20of%20serotonin%20in%20the%20brain%20has%20not%20yet%20been%20found%20in%20depression%20patients.md). Dozens of different candidate [gene]()s have been ‚Äúfound,‚Äù but in follow-up studies each turned out to be fool‚Äôs gold. [Mental disorder]()s are too heterogeneous in presentation and in causality to be considered simple diseases; instead each of our currently defined disorders will eventually turn out to be many different diseases.
