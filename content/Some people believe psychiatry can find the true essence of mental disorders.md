## Some people believe psychiatry can find the true essence of mental disorders # 

One perspective on psychiatry comes form those [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Materialism|materialists]] who have great faith in science to detect the true essence of things. For them, [[mental disorder]]s will soon reveal their secrets through scientific study. This optimism was shared by most biological psychiatrists until about fifteen years ago but, except for a few diehards, is now rapidly fading away. Billions of research dollars have failed to produce convincing evidence that any [[mental disorder]] is a discrete disease entity with a unitary cause. [[An overabundance of dopamine in schizophrenics has yet to be found]], and [[a shortage of serotonin in the brain has not yet been found in depression patients]]. Dozens of different candidate [[gene]]s have been “found,” but in follow-up studies each turned out to be fool’s gold. [[Mental disorder]]s are too heterogeneous in presentation and in causality to be considered simple diseases; instead each of our currently defined disorders will eventually turn out to be many different diseases.
