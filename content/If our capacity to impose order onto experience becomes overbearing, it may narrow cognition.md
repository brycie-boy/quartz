## If our capacity to impose order onto experience becomes overbearing, it may narrow cognition

In general, the kind of precooked or conventionalized thinking produced by [predictive coding](Predictive%20coding.md) usually serves us well. But only up to a point, since [the left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20be%20stubbornly%20certain,%20whereas%20the%20right%20acknowledges%20ambiguity%20and%20is%20always%20uncertain.md). We pay a price for the achievement of order and [identity view](Identity%20view.md) in the adult human mind. While suppressing uncertainty in the [brain](Brain.md) serves to promote realism, foresight, careful reflection and an ability to recognize and overcome wishful and paranoid fantasies, at the same time this achievement tends to constrain cognition and exert a limiting or narrowing influence on [consciousness](Consciousness.md), which may lead us too far into a [low-entropy state](Low-entropy%20state.md). At it's extreme, it may lead us into [Idolatry](Idolatry.md).
