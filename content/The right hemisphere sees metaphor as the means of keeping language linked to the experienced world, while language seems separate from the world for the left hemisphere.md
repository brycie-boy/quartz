## The right hemisphere sees metaphor as the means of keeping language linked to the experienced world, while language seems separate from the world for the left hemisphere # 

[[Every word is metaphorically linked to the something in the lived world]], and[[All denotation and abstraction has its metaphorical roots in the lived world]]. Metaphor embodies thought and places it in a living context. These three areas of difference between the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s‚Äîmetaphor, context ([[the right hemisphere sees things in their context]], and [[The left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]]) and the body‚Äîare all interpenetrated one with another. Once again it is the [[right hemisphere]], in its concern for the immediacy of experience ([[novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]]), that is more densely interconnected with and involved in the body ([[The right hemisphere is much more involved in emotions and bodily experience than the left hemisphere]]), the ground of that experience. Where the [[right hemisphere]] can see that metaphor is the only way to preserve the link between language and the world it refers to, the [[left hemisphere]] sees it either as a lie (As Locke, expressing Enlightenment disdain, called metaphors ‚Äòperfect cheats‚Äô) or as a distracting ornament; and connotation as a limitation, since in the interests of certainty the [[left hemisphere]] ([[the narrowness of certainty appeals to the left hemisphere]]) prefers single meanings.

The left hemisphere sees language as separate from experience, and identical with reality

For the [[left hemisphere]], consequently, language can come to seem cut off from the world, to be itself the reality; and reality as a result seem made up of bits strung together, as the words are strung together by syntax. The [[left hemisphere]] is bound to see language like this because it understands things by starting from the observation of ‚Äòpieces‚Äô and builds them up to make something ([[the right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts]]), and this is the only route it has to understanding both the world and language itself, the medium with which it does its understanding, including its understanding of language.
