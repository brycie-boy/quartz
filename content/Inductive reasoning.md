## Inductive reasoning  # 

Inductive reasoning is a method of reasoning in which a general principle is derived from a body of observations. It consists of making broad generalizations based on specific observations. Inductive reasoning is distinct from [[deductive reasoning]], where the conclusion of a deductive argument is _certain_ given the [[premise]]s are correct; in contrast, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is _[[probability|probable]]_, based upon the evidence given.
