## Inductive reasoning

Inductive reasoning is a method of reasoning in which a general principle is derived from a body of observations. It consists of making broad generalizations based on specific observations. Inductive reasoning is distinct from [deductive reasoning](Deductive%20reasoning.md), where the conclusion of a deductive argument is *certain* given the [premise](Premise.md)s are correct; in contrast, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is *[probable]()*, based upon the evidence given.
