## Parents seek autism diagnoses for their children to acquire eligibility for school and therapeutic programs

Probably the most important factor in the proliferation of [autism]() diagnoses was the positive feedback loop between spirited patient advocacy and the provision of school and therapeutic programs that require an [autism]() diagnosis. 
About half of the ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù is probably service driven‚Äîchildren get the diagnosis incorrectly because it is the ticket to more attention in the school system and more intense mental health treatment. This is even more concerning considering how [public schools serve to manufacture a manageable population and to put down dissent and originality](Public%20schools%20serve%20to%20manufacture%20a%20manageable%20population%20and%20to%20put%20down%20dissent%20and%20originality.md). And in schools, these [psychiatric diagnosis‚Äô can distort and control dissenting information by regarding rebellious behavior as a product of mental illness](Psychiatric%20diagnosis%E2%80%99%20can%20distort%20and%20control%20dissenting%20information%20by%20regarding%20rebellious%20behavior%20as%20a%20product%20of%20mental%20illness.md). This is why i think this plays a large role in [the selective function](The%20selective%20function.md).

* psychiatry's connection to eugenics

As the population of ‚Äúautistic‚Äù patients and their families grew, they gained the power to push for many additional services‚Äîsometimes by initiating successful lawsuits. The additional services then provided further incentive to increased diagnosis. With more people diagnosed, there was then an even larger constituency to push for more services.
