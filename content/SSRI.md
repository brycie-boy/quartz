## Heading # 

[[Serotonin-1a autoreceptors on the dorsal raphe nucleus ensure that it releases a balanced amount of serotonin]]. SSRIs work by turn those [[autoreceptor]]s off; it’s like setting the temperature threshold on your servo-mechanism thermostat much higher, and those [[serotonin]] nerve terminals fire more [[serotonin]]; thus the antidepressant effects.

The physical side effects of SSRIs may cause insomnia, sexual dysfunction, headaches, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness, tremors, nervousness, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, [[seizure]]s, and a severe inner agitation known as akathisia, which is associated with an increased risk of violence and suicide.
