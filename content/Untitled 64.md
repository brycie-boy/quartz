## Heading # 

Youth diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] are typically put on drug cocktails that include an [[Atypical antipsychotic]] and a [[mood stabilizer]]. This means that they now have multiple [[neurotransmitter]] pathways in their [[brain]]s that are being mucked up, and naturally, this treatment does not lead them back to emotional and physical health. In 2002, [[DelBello]] reported that [[lithium]], [[antidepressant]]s, and [[mood stabilizer]]s all failed to help [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] youth fare better at the end of two years. Those who were treated with a [[neuroleptic]], she added, “were significantly less likely to recover than those who did not receive a [[neuroleptic]].” Six years later, Hayes, Inc., a Pennsylvania consulting firm that conducts “unbiased” assessments of drugs for health-care providers, concluded that there was no good scientific evidence that the [[mood stabilizer]]s and [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s prescribed for [[bipolar disorder]] were either safe or effective. “Our findings indicate that at this time, [[anticonvulsant]]s and [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s cannot be recommended for children diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]]s,” said [[Elisabeth Houtsmuller]], senior analyst for Hayes. These reports attest to a lack of drug efficacy, but as Houtsmuller noted, the side effects from these “pharmacological treatments” are “alarming.” In particular, atypical antipsychotics may cause metabolic dysfunction, hormonal abnormalities, diabetes, obesity, emotional blunting, and tardive dyskinesia
