## Non-forcing

Non-forcing is when one acts spontaneously without [clinging](Clinging.md) to desired outcomes. Non-forcing is a an example of how [we can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives](We%20can%20use%20our%20stress%20as%20a%20navigational%20tool%20to%20help%20guide%20our%20lives.md). When we notice ourselves straining, we can rethink how we are approaching a situation. Neurologically, it involves the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), since [the right hemisphere allows for flexibility in thought and behavior](The%20right%20hemisphere%20allows%20for%20flexibility%20in%20thought%20and%20behavior.md). With the successful practice of non-forcing one can achieve [flow](Flow.md). 

Non-forcing is also said to be a behavioral characteristic of the [Monad](Monad.md). In the words of [Lao Tzu](): 

 > 
 > "The softest things \[in nature\] . . . \[overcome\] the hardest things . . . That which \[lacks\] substance enters into that which \[lacks\] openings. From this I know the benefits of non-forcing"

Water carves through stone simply by following gravity and seeping into its cracks; electricity flows through a block of metal. Thus, the [Monad](Monad.md) can permeate all things, even if they appear to be solid, without any cracks or openings. We can extrapolate from this to understand life. The [Monad](Monad.md) acts without forcing and achieves effortlessly. We find inspiration in this and see the possibility to act without forcing and achieve great works without friction or resistance.
