## Non-forcing  # 

- Non-forcing refers to a kind of spontaneous, intuitive, natural and flexible way of acting
- as opposed to action that is consciously willed, deliberate, contrived, and rigid.
- without [[clinging]] to or straining for desired outcomes
- It’s like brrathing in mindfulness. You don’t control it. You just take the back seat and let the unconscious do it’s thing
- Neurologically, i attribute it to the [[right hemisphere]], since [[the right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior]]. It also may involve decreased activity in the [[posterior cingulate cortex]]. With the successful practice of non-forcing one can achieve [[flow]]. 

Non-forcing is also said to be a behavioral characteristic of the [[Monad]]. In the words of [[Lao Tzu]]: 

> "The softest things [in nature] . . . [overcome] the hardest things . . . That which [lacks] substance enters into that which [lacks] openings. From this I know the benefits of non-forcing"

- The [[Monad]] produces the world spontaneously without deliberation and without knowing how it does it. Nature moves without deliberation.

Water carves through stone simply by following gravity and seeping into its cracks; electricity flows through a block of metal. Thus, the [[Monad]] can permeate all things, even if they appear to be solid, without any cracks or openings. We can extrapolate from this to understand life. The [[Monad]] acts without forcing and achieves effortlessly. We find inspiration in this and see the possibility to act without forcing and achieve great works without friction or resistance.
