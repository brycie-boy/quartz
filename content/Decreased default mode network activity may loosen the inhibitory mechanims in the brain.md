## Decreased default mode network activity may loosen the inhibitory mechanims in the brain

The [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) and other centers of mental activity may be ‚Äúlet off the leash‚Äù when the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) leaves the stage, and in fact [brain](Brain.md) scans show an increase in activity in several other [brain](Brain.md) regions, including the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md), under the influence of [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s. This disinhibition might explain why material that is unavailable to us during normal waking consciousness now floats to the surface of our awareness, including emotions and memories and, sometimes, long-buried childhood traumas. It may also be why [Psychedelics and mindfulness let in extra sensory signals by silencing the default mode network](Psychedelics%20and%20mindfulness%20let%20in%20extra%20sensory%20signals%20by%20silencing%20the%20default%20mode%20network.md). It is for these reasons that some scientists and psychotherapists believe [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s can be profitably used to surface and explore the contents of the unconscious mind.
