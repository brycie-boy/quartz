## Decreased default mode network activity may loosen the inhibitory mechanims in the brain # 
 
The [[default mode network]] and other centers of mental activity may be ‚Äúlet off the leash‚Äù when the [[default mode network]] leaves the stage, and in fact [[brain]] scans show an increase in activity in several other [[brain]] regions, including the [[limbic system]], under the influence of [[psychedelic]]s. This disinhibition might explain why material that is unavailable to us during normal waking consciousness now floats to the surface of our awareness, including emotions and memories and, sometimes, long-buried childhood traumas. It may also be why [[psychedelics and mindfulness let in extra sensory signals by silencing the default mode network]]. It is for these reasons that some scientists and psychotherapists believe [[psychedelic]]s can be profitably used to surface and explore the contents of the unconscious mind.
