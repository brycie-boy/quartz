## Most people take only transient notes

In contrast with [☯️ The Flow](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Flow.md), [most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts](Most%20people%20use%20notes%20as%20a%20bucket%20for%20storage%20or%20scratch%20thoughts.md). These are very convenient to write, but after a year of writing such notes, they’ll just have a pile of dissociated notes. The notes won’t have *added up* to anything: they’re more like fuel, written and discarded to help the author process their ongoing experiences. Fleeting notes are valuable scratchpads to temporarily support [working memory](Working%20memory.md), but [knowledge work should accrete](Knowledge%20work%20should%20accrete.md), so we should view them as “messy-thought” inputs for the “neat-thought” notes they’ll inform. This is one reason why [Note-writing practices are generally ineffective]().
