## It is much easier for psychiatrists to diagnose in a field study than in everyday practice # 

Another problem with how [[psychiatrists must run field trials for each new set of diagnostic criteria to prevent unpleasant surprises]] is that patient selection in a field trial also artificially raises reliability. In real life, making a diagnosis is like finding a needle in a haystack containing hundreds of possible choices. The field test presents a much easier challenge to the clinician. He knows he is selecting from among only a handful of different choices.
