## It is much easier for psychiatrists to diagnose in a field study than in everyday practice

Another problem with how [psychiatrists must run field trials for each new set of diagnostic criteria to prevent unpleasant surprises](Psychiatrists%20must%20run%20field%20trials%20for%20each%20new%20set%20of%20diagnostic%20criteria%20to%20prevent%20unpleasant%20surprises.md) is that patient selection in a field trial also artificially raises reliability. In real life, making a diagnosis is like finding a needle in a haystack containing hundreds of possible choices. The field test presents a much easier challenge to the clinician. He knows he is selecting from among only a handful of different choices.
