That was all i wanted to know. 

Also I didn't know meta-programming was involved in magick. I thought magick was just siddhis. Remote viewing, clarevoyance, divination, etc. I'd like to read books on magick that pertain to meta-programming. Been a while since i read anything on magick. Not my biggest interest tbh

Although i think some forms of magick may involve the thinker and the prover. Like curses for example. If the thinker thinks its cursed, the prover will only show us negativity. To "break a curse" is to become a metaprogrammer. Manifestation seems like another instance. If you expect to manifest something, the prover will be on the look out for it, or your actions will unconsciously be guided toward achieving it

But perhaps i don't understand either concept enough :p
