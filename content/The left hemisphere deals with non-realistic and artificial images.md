## The left hemisphere deals with non-realistic and artificial images

Contrary to how [the right hemisphere deals with real things that have meaning to us in the lived world](The%20right%20hemisphere%20deals%20with%20real%20things%20that%20have%20meaning%20to%20us%20in%20the%20lived%20world.md), the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is more at home dealing with distorted, non-realistic, fantastic—ultimately artificial—images. This may be because they invite analysis by parts, rather than as a whole (see [the right hemisphere sees the whole before the left hemisphere separates it into parts](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20the%20whole%20before%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20separates%20it%20into%20parts.md)). But it does appear that the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) has a positive bias towards whatever is bizarre, meaningless or non-existent.
