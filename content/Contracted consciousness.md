## Contracted consciousness

Contracted consciousness occurs with states such as obsession, fear, defensiveness, being rushed, worried, or regretful, and [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md), and involves a more accute sense of self-awareness because these feelings usually demand access to our autobiographical memories. It is correlated with an increase in activity in the [posterior cingulate cortex](Posterior%20cingulate%20cortex.md) and the activiation of the [sympathetic nervous system](Sympathetic%20nervous%20system.md). It contrasts with [expanded consciousness](Expanded%20consciousness.md).
