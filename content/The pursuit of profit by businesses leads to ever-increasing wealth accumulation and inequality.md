## The pursuit of profit by businesses leads to ever-increasing wealth accumulation and inequality

The fact that [businesses seek to form monopolies so they can increase profits by maximizing prices](Businesses%20seek%20to%20form%20monopolies%20so%20they%20can%20increase%20profits%20by%20maximizing%20prices.md) and that [businesses seek to pay workers as little as possible increase profits](Businesses%20seek%20to%20pay%20workers%20as%20little%20as%20possible%20increase%20profits.md) leads to tremendous accumulation of wealth to the capitalist class and ever-increasing wealth inequality between workers and capitalists. By definition, [capitalism](Capitalism.md) will always lead to the rich getting richer and the poor getting way more poor.
