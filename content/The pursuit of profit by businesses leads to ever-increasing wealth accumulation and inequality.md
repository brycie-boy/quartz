## The pursuit of profit by businesses leads to ever-increasing wealth accumulation and inequality   # 

The fact that [[businesses seek to form monopolies so they can increase profits by maximizing prices]] and that [[businesses seek to pay workers as little as possible increase profits]] leads to tremendous accumulation of wealth to the capitalist class and ever-increasing wealth inequality between workers and capitalists. By definition, [[capitalism]] will always lead to the rich getting richer and the poor getting way more poor.
