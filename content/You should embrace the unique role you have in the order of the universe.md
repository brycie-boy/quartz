## You should embrace the unique role you have in the order of the universe #üß† 

[[To be innovative, we must embrace our uniqueness]], and [[those who are not following their own unique course experience friction from being in conflict with the order of the Universe]]. We should therefor be [[Self-reliance|self-reliant]]. One must recognize that every person¬†has a unique role to play. The people who we consider great are the ones who have most effectively had that recognition. [[Humanities greatest thinkers are those who defied groupthink and authority bias and followed their own judgement]]. People should not be afraid to make whatever their individual contribution is if they are to participate in advancing society. Those who succeed in this process will find their [[True Will]].
