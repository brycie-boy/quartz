[To be innovative, we must embrace our uniqueness](To%20be%20innovative,%20we%20must%20embrace%20our%20uniqueness.md), and [those who are not following their own unique course experience friction from being in conflict with the order of the Universe](Those%20who%20are%20not%20following%20their%20own%20unique%20course%20experience%20friction%20from%20being%20in%20conflict%20with%20the%20order%20of%20the%20Universe.md). We should therefor be [self-reliant](Self-reliance.md). One must recognize that every person¬†has a unique role to play.

[Humanities greatest thinkers are those who defied groupthink and authority bias and followed their own judgement](Humanities%20greatest%20thinkers%20are%20those%20who%20defied%20groupthink%20and%20authority%20bias%20and%20followed%20their%20own%20judgement.md). People should not be afraid to make whatever their individual contribution is if they are to participate in advancing society. Those who succeed in this process will find their [True Will](True%20Will.md).
