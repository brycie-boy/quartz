## Polyphenol  # 

Polyphenols are a type of [[antioxidant]] that act as low-dose toxins that train the body to mount an immune response in a process called [[hormesis]]. Polyphenols can also exert other biological effects that are helpful to the brain; for example, they influence the survival and regeneration of neurons. The richest sources of polyphenols are berries, cherries, eggplant, onions, kale, coffee, and green tea.
