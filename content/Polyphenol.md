## Polyphenol

Polyphenols are a type of [antioxidant]() that act as low-dose toxins that train the body to mount an immune response in a process called [hormesis](). Polyphenols can also exert other biological effects that are helpful to the brain; for example, they influence the survival and regeneration of neurons. The richest sources of polyphenols are berries, cherries, eggplant, onions, kale, coffee, and green tea.
