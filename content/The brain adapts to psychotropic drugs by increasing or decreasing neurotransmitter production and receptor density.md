## The brain adapts to psychotropic drugs by increasing or decreasing neurotransmitter production and receptor density # 

I’m 1996, neuroscientist, and the director of NIMH through 1996-2001, published a paper in the American Journal of Psychiatry titled “Initiation and Adaptation: A Paradigm for Understanding Psychotropic Drug Action” which told of how all psychotropic drugs could be understood to act on the brain.

Antipsychotics, antidepressants, and other psychotropic drugs “create perturbations in [[neurotransmitter]] functions.” In response, the [[brain]] goes through a series of compensatory adaptations. [[Drug]]s that block a [[neurotransmitter]] ([[antagonists]]), such as [[antipsychotic]]s, make the [[autoreceptor]]s tell the presynaptic [[neuron]]s spring into hyper gear and release more of it, and the postsynaptic [[neuron]]s increase the density of their [[receptor]]s for that chemical messenger. [[Drug]]s that increase the synaptic levels of a [[neurotransmitter]] ([[agonist]]) (as an antidepressant does), the presynaptic [[neuron]]s decrease their firing rates and the postsynaptic [[neuron]]s decrease the density of their [[receptor]]s for the [[neurotransmitter]]. In each instance, the [[brain]] is trying to nullify the [[drug]]’s effects. “These adaptations,” Hyman explain “are rooted in homeostatic mechanisms that exist, presumably, to permit cells to maintain their equilibrium in the face of alterations in the environment or changes in the internal milieu.”

However, after a period of time, these compensatory mechanisms break down. The “chronic administration” of the drug the causes “substantial and long-lasting alterations in [[Neuron|neural]] function.” As part of this long-term adaptation process, there are changes in intracellular signaling pathways and [[gene]] expression. After a few weeks the person’s [[brain]] is functioning in a manner that is “qualitatively different from the normal state.” [[Modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it]]. This may also involve [[right hemisphere]] deficit because [[the right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes]].
