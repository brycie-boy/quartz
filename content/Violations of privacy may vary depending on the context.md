## Violations of privacy may vary depending on the context

Violations of privacy are not all equal. Context matters. Theres a difference between a TSA officer finding porn in your suitcase and and your spouse finding it. There's a difference between the police learning about your drug use and your friends learning about it. And violations of privacy are not all equally damaging. Those of us in marginal socioeconomic situations‚Äîand marginalized racial, political, ethnic, and religous groups‚Äîare effected more. Those who are in powerful postitions who are subject to peoples continued approval are effected more. The lives of some of us depend on privacy.
