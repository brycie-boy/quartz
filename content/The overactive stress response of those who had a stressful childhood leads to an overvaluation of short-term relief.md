## The overactive stress response of those who had a stressful childhood leads to an overvaluation of short-term relief # 

[[A stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life]], and a [[brain]] preset to be easily triggered into a [[stress response]] is likely to assign a high value to substances, activities, and situations that provide short-term relief. It will have less interest in long-term consequences, just as people in extremes of thirst will greedily consume water knowing that it may contain toxins. On the other hand, situations or activities that for the average person are likely to bring satisfaction are undervalued because, in the addict‚Äôs life, they have not been rewarding.

Hard-core drug [[addiction|addicts]], whose lives invariably began under conditions of severe stress, are all too readily triggered into a stress reaction. Not only does the stress response easily overwhelm the addict‚Äôs already-challenged capacity for rational thought when emotionally aroused, but the [[hormone]]s of stress also ‚Äúcross-sensitize‚Äù with addictive substances. The more one is present, the more the other is [[craving|craved]]. [[Addiction]] is a deeply ingrained response to stress, an attempt to cope with it through self-soothing. Maladaptive in the long term, it is highly effective in the short term.
