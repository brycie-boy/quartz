## The right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes

Because of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s openness to the interconnectedness of things (see [the right hemisphere sees things in their context](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20things%20in%20their%20context.md)), it is interested in others as individuals, and in how we relate to them. It is the mediator of empathic identification. I imagine myself in pain I use both hemispheres, but your pain is in my [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md). The same [neuron](Neuron.md)s in the right [anterior cingulate cortex](), an area known to be associated with the appreciation of pain, show activity whether we ourselves are hurt or we witness someone else undergoing a similar painful experience. Self-awareness, empathy, identification with others, and more generally inter-subjective processes, are largely dependent upon [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) resources. When we put ourselves in others' shoes, we are using the right [inferior parietal lobe](), and the right [lateral prefrontal cortex](), which is involved in inhibiting the automatic tendency to espouse one's own point of view. In circumstances of [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) activation, subjects are more favorably disposed towards others and more readily convinced by arguments in favor of positions that they have not previously supported.
