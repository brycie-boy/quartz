## Clinging to our personal views of a situation gives rise to conflict and disputes  #⏳ 

it is obvious that no two people have the same development and life experiences. We are all living in separate [[reality tunnel]]s. That is why communication fails so often, and misunderstandings and resentments are so common. [[Clinging]] to our personal [[reality tunnel]]s lead to one-sided, biased interpretations of reality that we cling to as accurate and complete. Those who tenaciously cling to their own [[reality tunnel]] often come into conflict with those with a different [[reality tunnel]], thus giving rise to conflicts and disputes. 

This is the idea behind of [[the Buddha]]'s famous parable of the blind men and the elephant. This parable involves a king who decided to round up all the blind men in the city. After doing so, the the king asked his servants to show the blind men an elephant. Each man was presented with a different part of the elephant. The king then asked the group of blind men ‘what is an elephant like?’. Each of the men described the elephant in terms of the part they had been shown. These men, in there certainty, each stated “An elephant is like this, an elephant is not like that!" and proceeded to verbally and physically assault each other, and the king was delighted.
