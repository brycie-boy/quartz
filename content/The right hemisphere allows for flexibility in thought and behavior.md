## The right hemisphere allows for flexibility in thought and behavior

Since [novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar](Novel%20experience%20and%20information%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20right%20hemisphere,%20and%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20once%20it%20becomes%20familiar.md), the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is more capable of a shift in perspective, and not surprisingly the right [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md) is especially important for flexibility of thought, with damage in that area leading to perseveration, a pathological inability to respond flexibly to changing situations. For example, having found an approach that works for one problem, subjects seem to get stuck, and will inappropriately apply it to a second problem that requires a different approach‚Äîor even, having answered one question right, will give the same answer to the next and the next. It is the right [orbitofrontal cortex](Orbitofrontal%20cortex.md) that is responsible for inhibiting one's immediate response, and hence for flexibility and set-shifting, as well as the power of inhibiting immediate response to environmental stimuli.
