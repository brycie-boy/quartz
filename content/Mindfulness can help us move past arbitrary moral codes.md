## Mindfulness can help us move past arbitrary moral codes  # 

- [[Many doctrines expound ideas which require a degree of trust and insist upon our faith in them]]
- [[The left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]]

Bringing fuller awareness to our encounters through [[mindfulness]] may help us move beyond blanket codes of conduct derived from such questions as “Why do I have to?” and “How does this apply to me?”. [[The results of an action can disincentivize us to perform that action in the future]], and as children grow up learning the results of their behavior, they might broaden their application of the “don’t be mean” rule to cover a wide range of moral decisions rather than immediately searching for loopholes or ways to circumvent externally imposed restrictions. Thus, if we follow how we have evolved to learn ([[operant conditioning]]) and simply start attending [[Mindfulness|mindfully]] to what our bodies are telling us, the rules might get simpler (though not necessarily easier). Get triggered. Be mean. See how much pain this causes both parties. Don’t repeat.
