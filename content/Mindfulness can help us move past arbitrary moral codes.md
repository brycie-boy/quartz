## Mindfulness can help us move past arbitrary moral codes

* [Many doctrines expound ideas which require a degree of trust and insist upon our faith in them](Many%20doctrines%20expound%20ideas%20which%20require%20a%20degree%20of%20trust%20and%20insist%20upon%20our%20faith%20in%20them.md)
* [The left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20understand%20things%20as%20logical,%20abstract,%20and%20stripped%20of%20context.md)

Bringing fuller awareness to our encounters through [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) may help us move beyond blanket codes of conduct derived from such questions as “Why do I have to?” and “How does this apply to me?” [The results of an action can disincentivize us to perform that action in the future](The%20results%20of%20an%20action%20can%20disincentivize%20us%20to%20perform%20that%20action%20in%20the%20future.md), and as children grow up learning the results of their behavior, they might broaden their application of the “don’t be mean” rule to cover a wide range of moral decisions rather than immediately searching for loopholes or ways to circumvent externally imposed restrictions. Thus, if we follow how we have evolved to learn ([operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md)) and simply start attending [mindfully](Mindfulness.md) to what our bodies are telling us, the rules might get simpler (though not necessarily easier). Get triggered. Be mean. See how much pain this causes both parties. Don’t repeat.
