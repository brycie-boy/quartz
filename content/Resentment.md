## Resentment

Nietzsche’s concept of “resentment"—the hidden revenge motive within “altruistic” philosophies—claims there is an element of hostility within even the [Friendly Weakness]() side of the [the four quadrants](The%20four%20quadrants.md); i.e., in conventional “Christian ethics,” as typified by the image of “gentle Jesus, meek and mild.” This paradox—the Friendly Weakling is a Hostile Weakling in disguise, the Flower Child a potential Mansonized robo-killer—reappears in modern clinical parlance as the concept of “passive aggressive.” Occultists in their strange jargon describe these types as “psychic vampires.”

This is why Nietzsche claimed that St. Paul had destroyed the evangel (good news) of Jesus and replaced it with a dysangel (bad news). The evangel of Jesus, as Nietzsche saw it, was the sublimated [Will to Power](), the path of conscious evolution to Superhumanity. The dysangel, the bad news, created by St. Paul was traditional Sklavmoral—“Slaves, obey your masters,” but nourish your resentment with the firm belief that you are “good,” and they are “evil,” and you will eventually have the pleasure of watching them burn in hell forever.

* The fact that [the more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world](The%20more%20certain%20of%20our%20views%20we%20become,%20the%20more%20we%20perceive%20ourselves%20to%20be%20victims%20of%20an%20impersonal%20world.md) is probably the reason why [Fredrich Neitzsche](), who understood the pathology from within, raged against denying the "real" universe entirely, and against what he called the Revenge Motive. If a man feels overwhelmed by the "real" universe, he will seek to destroy what oppresses him. And since we cannot get at the "real" universe, revenge must be directed at symbolic targets within our [Emic Reality](Emic%20Reality.md)s. The capacity for neurological self-criticism, which Neitzsche calls the [Will to Power](), then becomes deflected into a Will to Destroy. Neitzsche here is describing the process by which we shirk responsibility. We seek revenge, but since we are only *reacting*, the "real" universe made us do it. Man as a reactive mechanism—the [Materialists](Materialism.md) metaphor—is a man with a grudge. 
* One of the most well known lines of verse from the 20th Century is from Alfred Edward Housman: "I, a stranger and afraid, In a world I never made." This is the self-image of modern humanity: [The Right Man](The%20Right%20Man.md) in particular, but also of the masses of ordinary men and women who have internalized the [Fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) [Materialist](Materialism.md) metaphor and have made it their [Idol](Idol.md).
