## Resentment

Nietzsche’s concept of “resentment"—the hidden revenge motive within “altruistic” philosophies—claims there is an element of hostility within even the [Friendly Weakness]() side of the grid; i.e., in conventional “Christian ethics,” as typified by the image of “gentle Jesus, meek and mild.” This paradox—the Friendly Weakling is a Hostile Weakling in disguise, the Flower Child a potential Mansonized robot-killer—reappears in modern clinical parlance as the concept of “passive aggressive.” Occultists in their strange jargon describe these types as “psychic vampires.”

This is why Nietzsche claimed that St. Paul had destroyed the evangel (good news) of Jesus and replaced it with a dysangel (bad news). The evangel of Jesus, as Nietzsche saw it, was the sublimated Will to Power, the path of conscious evolution to Superhumanity. The dysangel, the bad news, created by St. Paul was traditional Sklavmoral—“Slaves, obey your masters,” but nourish your resentment with the firm belief that you are “good,” and they are “evil,” and you will eventually have the pleasure of watching them burn in hell forever.
