## Free play can elevate mental illness in students by giving them a sense of control, allowing them to confront risk, letting them learn social skills and allowing to find their passions

[Anxiety disorder](), [depression](Depression.md), and sense of helplessness, have all increased in young people:

* [As of 2010, 85 percent of students have depression and anxiety scores higher than the average in the 50s](As%20of%202010,%2085%20percent%20of%20students%20have%20depression%20and%20anxiety%20scores%20higher%20than%20the%20average%20in%20the%2050s.md)
* [As of 2010, suicide rates have quadrupled for students under 15 and and doubled for those between 15 and 24](As%20of%202010,%20suicide%20rates%20have%20quadrupled%20for%20students%20under%2015%20and%20and%20doubled%20for%20those%20between%2015%20and%2024.md)
* [Scores for MMPI and MMPI-A tests rose significantly between 1938 and 1989](Scores%20for%20MMPI%20and%20MMPI-A%20tests%20rose%20significantly%20between%201938%20and%201989.md)

As any good scientist will tell you, correlation does not prove causation. The observation of increase in [mental illness]() in young people as play has declined does not by itself prove that the latter causes the former. However, a strong logical case can be built for such causation.

Free play is nature‚Äôs means of teaching children that they are not helpless. In play, away from adults, children really do have control and can practice asserting it. In free play, children learn to make their own decisions, solve their own problems, create and abide by rules, and get along with others as equals rather than as obedient or rebellious subordinates. In vigorous outdoor play, children deliberately dose themselves with moderate amounts of fear‚Äîas they swing, slide, or twirl on playground equipment, climb on monkey bars or trees, or skateboard down banisters‚Äîand they thereby learn how to control not only their bodies, but also their fear. In social play children learn how to negotiate with others, how to please others, and how to modulate and overcome the anger that can arise from conflicts. Free play is also nature‚Äôs means of helping children discover what they love. In their play children try out many activities and discover where their talents and predilections lie. None of these lessons can be taught through verbal means; they can be learned only through experience, which free play provides. The predominant emotions of play are interest and joy.
