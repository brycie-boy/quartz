## Indeterminate statement  #🧠

An indeterminate proposition is one which cannot be verified or refuted when it is confronted, but there are clear scientific processes by which it can be verified at a future date. To call such statements “false” would be to say that the case is already closed, and no investigation is necessary, thus giving way to potential dogma and [idolatry](Idolatry.md). [Logical positivists](Logical%20positivism.md) once wanted to call these [meaningless statement](Meaningless%20statement.md)s, but that position has since been abandoned.
