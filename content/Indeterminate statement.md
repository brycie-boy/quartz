## Indeterminate statement  #🧠 

An indeterminate proposition is one which cannot be verified or refuted when it is confronted, but there are clear scientific processes by which it can be verified at a future date. To call such statements “false” would be to say that the case is already closed, and no investigation is necessary, thus giving way to potential dogma and [[idolatry]]. [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] once wanted to call these [[meaningless statement]]s, but that position has since been abandoned.
