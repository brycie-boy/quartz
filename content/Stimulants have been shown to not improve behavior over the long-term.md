## Stimulants have been shown to not improve behavior over the long-term # 

[[Schools have found Ritalin to be useful in subduing hyperactive students and making them more easily manageable]]. However, when researchers looked at whether [[stimulant]]s improved a child’s behavior over the long term, they couldn’t find any benefit. When a child stopped taking [[Ritalin]], [[ADHD]] behaviors regularly flared up, the “excitability, impulsivity, or talkativeness” worse than ever. “It is often disheartening to observe how rapidly behavior deteriorates when medication is discontinued,” confesses psychologist [[Carol Whalen]]. Nor was there evidence that staying on a [[stimulant]] led to a sustained improvement in behavior. “Teachers and parents should not expect long-term improvement in academic achievement or reduced antisocial behavior,” wrote the psychologist [[James Swanson]] and director of an [[ADHD]] center at the University of California, Irvine in 1993. The 1994 edition of the [[APA]]’s Textbook of Psychiatry admitted to the same bottom-line conclusion: “[[Stimulant]]s do not produce lasting improvements in aggressivity, conduct disorder, criminality, education achievement, job functioning, marital relationships, or long-term adjustment.” Thirty years of research had failed to provide any good-quality evidence that [[stimulant]]s helped “hyperactive” children thrive, and in the early 1990s, a team of prominent [[ADHD]] experts picked to lead a long-term [[NIMH]] study, known as the Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with [[ADHD]], acknowledged that this was so. “The long-term efficacy of [[stimulant]] medication has not been demonstrated for any domain of child functioning,” they wrote.
