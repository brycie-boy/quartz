## Each scientific revolution has been shown to take one full generation to turn over the old world view  # 

Science itself, contrary to what some might want to believe, is not free of neophobia. [[Thomas Kuhn]] has demonstrated, at length, that each scientific revolution took one full generation to turn over the old paradigm. And Kuhn further showed that the older scientists never are converted to the new paradigm. They are mechanically hooked to their original [[imprint]]s on the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]]. The revolution is complete, as Kuhn shows, only when a second generation, not hooked to the old [[imprint]], is able to compare the two models and decides rationally that the newer one really does make more sense. But if science has this one-generation time lag, what can be said of politics, religion, economics? Time-lags of centuries, or even millenniums, are common there.
