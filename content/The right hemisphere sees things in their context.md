## The right hemisphere sees things in their context

For the same reason that [the right hemisphere sees the whole before the left hemisphere separates it into parts](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20the%20whole%20before%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20separates%20it%20into%20parts.md), the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) also sees each thing in its context, as standing in a qualifying relationship with all that surrounds it, rather than taking it as a single isolated entity. Anything that requires indirect interpretation, which is not explicit or literal, that in other words requires contextual understanding, depends on the right [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md) for its meaning to be conveyed or received. The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) understands from indirect contextual clues, not only from explicit statement, whereas the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) will identify by labels rather than context (e.g. identifies that it must be winter because it is ‘January’, not by looking at the trees).
