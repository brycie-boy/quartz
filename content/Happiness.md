## Happiness  #🧠 

Since [[our culture confaltes happiness with pleasure]], I define happiness as the Aristotelian concept of eudemonia—that is, “contentment” or well-being and human flourishing, and neurologically it involves the [[serotonergic pathway]]. The keys to this definition are: (1) it’s not prone to acute changes in one’s life, and (2) it is unrelated to circumstance, so anyone can be happy, not just the fortunate.
