## Happiness  #🧠

Since [our culture confaltes happiness with pleasure](Our%20culture%20confaltes%20happiness%20with%20pleasure.md), I define happiness as the Aristotelian concept of eudemonia—that is, “contentment” or well-being and human flourishing, and neurologically it involves the [serotonergic pathway](Serotonergic%20pathway.md). The keys to this definition are: (1) it’s about life, not the afterlife, (2) it’s not prone to acute changes in one’s life, and (3) it is unrelated to circumstance, so anyone can be happy, not just the fortunate.
