## Insufficient social-emotional stimulation in infancy reduces the growth of dopamine neurons and receptors

* skeptical of this. Even if they do have less dopamine neurons, why does that mean less dopamine. And what if their receptor numbers increase? Wouldn't that balance thangs out anyways?

Happy, attuned emotional interactions with parents stimulate a release of [opioid peptide](Opioid%20peptide.md)s in an infant‚Äôs [brain](Brain.md). This promotes the [attachment](Attachment.md) relationship and the further development of the child‚Äôs [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md).1 On the other hand, [cortisol](Cortisol.md) reduces the numbers of both [opioid peptide](Opioid%20peptide.md)s and [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s.

We know from animal studies that social-emotional stimulation is necessary for the growth of the [neuron](Neuron.md)s that release [dopamine](Dopamine.md) and for the growth of [receptor](Receptor.md)s to which [dopamine](Dopamine.md) needs to bind in order to do its work. Even adult rats and mice kept in long-term isolation will have a reduced number of [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s in the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) and, notably, in the [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md). Rats separated from their mothers at an early stage display permanent disruption of the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md). Abnormalities in this system play a key role in the onset of [addiction](Addiction.md) and [craving](Craving.md). In adulthood these maternally deprived animals exhibit a greater propensity to self-administer [cocaine](Cocaine.md).4 And it doesn‚Äôt take extreme deprivation: 

in another study, rat pups deprived of their mother‚Äôs presence for only one hour a day during their first week of life grew up to be much more eager than their peers to take [cocaine](Cocaine.md) on their own.5 So the presence of consistent parental contact in infancy is one factor in the normal development of the [Limbic system](Limbic%20system.md); the absence of it makes the child more vulnerable to ‚Äúneeding‚Äù drugs of abuse later on to supplement what her own [brain](Brain.md) is lacking. Another key factor is the quality of the contact the parent provides, and this, as we saw in the previous chapter, depends very much on the parent‚Äôs mood and stress level.
