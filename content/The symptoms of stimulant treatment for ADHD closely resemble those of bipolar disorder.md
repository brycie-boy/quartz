## The symptoms of stimulant treatment for ADHD closely resemble those of bipolar disorder # 

[[Stimulant treatment causes patients to cycle through arousal and dysphoric states on a daily basis]]. These drug-induced symptoms overlap to a remarkable degree the symptoms said to be characteristic of juvenile [[bipolar disorder]]. In short, every child on a [[stimulant]] turns a bit [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]], and the risk that a child diagnosed with [[ADHD]] will move on to a [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] diagnosis after being treated with a [[stimulant]] has even been quantified. [[Joseph Biederman]] and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital reported in 1996 that 15 of 140 children (11 percent) diagnosed with [[ADHD]] developed [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] symptoms‚Äîwhich were not present at initial diagnosis‚Äîwithin four years. Also, [[juvenile bipolar disorder first arose in tandem with stimulant and antidepressant treatment in children]]. 

This gives us our first mathematical equation for solving the juvenile [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] epidemic: If a society prescribes [[stimulant]]s to 3.5 million children and adolescents, as is the case in the United States today, it should expect that this practice will create 400,000 [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] youth. As Time noted, most children with [[bipolar disorder]] are diagnosed with a different [[mental disorder]] first, with ‚Äú[[ADHD]] the likeliest first call.‚Äù
