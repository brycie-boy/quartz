## People go without because the bourgeois will limit production in order to keep prices up

The [bourgeoisie](Bourgeoisie.md) constantly reduces output by restraining production, and the production of the most necessary things is limited. However much workers want to produce and distribute goods freely, the [bourgeois](Bourgeoisie.md) will limit production and distribution in order to keep prices up, and thus people go without.
