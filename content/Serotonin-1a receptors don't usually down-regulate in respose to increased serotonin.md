## Serotonin-1a receptors don't usually down-regulate in respose to increased serotonin  #üß† 

in contrast to [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s, the [[Synapse|postsynaptic]] [[serotonin-1a receptor]]s don‚Äôt usually down-regulate in response to increased [[serotonin]]. These [[neuron]]s possess two special characteristics that keep our [[serotonin]] [[neuron]]s and [[receptor]]s resilient. This is because: 

- [[Serotonin-1a autoreceptors on the dorsal raphe nucleus ensure that it releases a balanced amount of serotonin]]
- [[Serotonin-1a receptors inhibit postsynaptic neurons]]
