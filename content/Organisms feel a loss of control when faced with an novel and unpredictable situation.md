## Organisms feel a loss of control when faced with an novel and unpredictable situation

Loss of control and lack of predictive information are closely related. Some researchers have emphasized this, pointing out that the common theme is that the organism is subjected to novelty. You thought you knew how to manage things, you thought you knew what would happen next, and it turns out you are wrong in this novel situation. The potency of this is demonstrated in primate studies in which merely placing the animal into a novel cage suppresses its [immune system](). Others have emphasized that these types of [stressor](Stressor.md)s cause arousal and vigilance, as you search for the new rules of control and prediction. Both views are different aspects of the same issue. Considering that [novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar](Novel%20experience%20and%20information%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20right%20hemisphere,%20and%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20once%20it%20becomes%20familiar.md), this kind of stress may have to do with an overbearing [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) resisting the new information and seeking control over circumstances.
