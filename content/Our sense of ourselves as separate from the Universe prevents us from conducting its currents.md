## Our sense of ourselves as separate from the Universe prevents us from conducting its currents # 

[[We may attract any force by making ourselves a fit condition for its manifestation]]. Our sense of ourselves as separate from, and opposed to, the Universe is a bar to our conducting of its currents. It insulates us. A popular leader is most successful when he forgets himself, and remembers only "The Cause." Self-seeking engenders jealousies and schism. When the organs of the body assert their presence otherwise than by silent satisfaction, it is a sign that they are diseased. The single exception is the organ of reproduction. Yet even in this case self-assertion bears witness to its dissatisfaction with itself, since it cannot fulfill its function until completed by its counterpart in another organism.
