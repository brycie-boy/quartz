## Brain

The brain is an [organ]() that serves as the center of the [nervous system](). It is three pound of tofu-like tissue containing 1.1 trillion [cell]()s, including 100 billion [neuron](Neuron.md)s and is the most complex [organ]() in the body. Even though it’s only 2 percent of the body’s weight, the brain uses 20–25 percent of its oxygen and [glucose](). Like a refrigerator, it’s always humming away, performing its functions; consequently, it uses about the same amount of energy whether you’re deep asleep or thinking hard. The number of possible combinations of 100 billion [neuron](Neuron.md)s firing or not is approximately 10 to the millionth power, or 1 followed by a million zeros, in principle; this is the number of possible states of your brain. To put this quantity in perspective, the number of atoms in the universe is estimated to be “only” about 10 to the eightieth power.
