## Amygdala activity triggers the VTA to release dopamine #🧠 

The [[amygdala]] also interacts with the [[ventral tegmental area]], the site of the [[dopamine]] [[neuron]]s. Stress and [[cortisol]] also shift your [[dopamine]] levels up, thereby increasing reward-seeking behaviors. Increased stress can turn a small desire into a big [[dopamine]] drive.
