The stress-fear-memory pathway is a part of the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) and consists of four areas. The first is the [amygdala](Amygdala.md), the stress or fear center. The [amygdala](Amygdala.md) is in communication with three other areas. First is the [hypothalamus](Hypothalamus.md) which controls all the hormones of your body, including the stress hormone [cortisol](Cortisol.md). It also sends messages to your [sympathetic nervous system](Sympathetic%20nervous%20system.md) (the fight-or-flight response) to get ready and your [vagus nerve]() (the calming nerve that slows everything down) to stop firing. 

The third is the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md) which is your memory center. It‚Äôs where you consolidate memories, both good and bad. The [amygdala](Amygdala.md) and the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md) are reciprocal in that when your [amygdala](Amygdala.md) figures out that an experience is not a good one, that information ends up stored by the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md). And finally the fourth area involved is the [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md); this is the wise area of the [brain](Brain.md) that keeps you from doing stupid things again. These four [brain](Brain.md) areas together keep your emotions from overwhelming your ability to think straight and your outward behavior in check.
