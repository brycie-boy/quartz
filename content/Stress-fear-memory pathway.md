The stress-fear-memory pathway is a part of the [[limbic system]] and consists of four areas. The first is the [[amygdala]], the stress or fear center. The [[amygdala]] is in communication with three other areas. First is the [[hypothalamus]] which controls all the hormones of your body, including the stress hormone [[cortisol]]. It also sends messages to your [[sympathetic nervous system]] to get ready and your [[vagus nerve]] (the calming nerve that slows everything down) to stop firing. 

The third is the [[hippocampus]] which is where you consolidate memories. The [[amygdala]] and the [[hippocampus]] are reciprocal in that when your [[amygdala]] figures out that an experience is not a good one, that information ends up stored by the [[hippocampus]]. And finally the fourth area involved is the [[prefrontal cortex]]; this is the wise area of the [[brain]] that keeps you from doing stupid things again. These four [[brain]] areas together keep your emotions from overwhelming your ability to think straight and your outward behavior in check.
