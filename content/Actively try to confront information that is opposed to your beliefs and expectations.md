## Actively try to confront information that is opposed to your beliefs and expectations #üß† 

Due to the fact that [[people have a tendency to become territorial over their belief systems]], some information is not only ignored but is actively resisted. Denial, anger, and even a desire to punish the messenger who brings "bad news" are well known traits of our species. To the extent that we are aware of this tendency, and try to combat it in our selves, we will make an effort to try to introduce unwelcome signals‚Äîfor example, by listening to ideas from groups who's [[reality tunnel]]s oppose our own. To the extent that we ignore or forget this tendency, we will relapse back into [[Fundamentalism]], [[idolatry]], and inquisitorial behavior.
