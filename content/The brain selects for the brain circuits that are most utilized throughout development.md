## The brain selects for the brain circuits that are most utilized throughout development #üß† 

[[Much of the growth of the human brain occurs after birth]]. This process is sometimes referred to as neural Darwinism because it invovles the selection of the [[neuron]]s, [[synapse]]s and circuits that help the [[brain]] adapt to its paticular environment, and the discarding of others. 

In the early stages of life, the infant‚Äôs [[brain]] has many more [[neuron]]s and connections than necessary‚Äîbillions of [[neuron]]s in excess of what will eventually be required. This overgrown, chaotic [[synapse|synaptic]] tangle needs to be trimmed to shape the [[brain]] into an organ that can govern action, thought, learning, and relationships and carry out its myriad other tasks‚Äîand to coordinate them all in our best interests. Which connections survive depends largely on input from the environment. Connections and circuits used frequently are strengthened, while unused ones are pruned out. Scientists call this aspect of neural Darwinism [[synapse|synaptic]] pruning. Both [[neuron]]s and neural connections compete to survive and grow. Experience causes some [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s (and not others) to survive and grow. 

Through this weeding out of unutilized [[cell]]s and [[synapse]]s, the selection of useful connections, and the formation of new ones, the specialized circuits of the maturing human [[brain]] emerge. This is what is refered to in ethology as [[imprint]]ing. The [[imprint]]ing process is highly specific to each individual person‚Äîso much so that not even the [[brain]]s of identical twins have the same nerve branching, connections, and circuitry. In large part, our early years define how well our [[brain]] structures will develop and how the neurological networks that control human behavior will mature.

At any point in the process of [[imprint]]ing you will have many potentials for either positive or negative stimulation to get in and set the microstructure of the [[brain]]. It is precisely here where the problem arises for young children who will, in adolescence and beyond, develop [[addiction]] and [[ADHD]] ([[ADHD and addiction can be traced to similar causes]]). Too much negative stimulation, and in many cases simply not enough positive stimulation. Our genetic capacity for [[brain]] development can find its full expression only if circumstances are favorable: [[Gene expression is highly contingent on the environment]].

To illustrate this, just imagine a baby who was cared for in every way but kept in a dark room. After a year of such sensory deprivation the [[brain]] of this infant would not be comparable to those of others, no matter its inherited potential. Despite perfectly good [[eye]]s at birth, without the stimulation of light waves, the neurological units that make up our visual sense would not develop. The neural components of vision already present at birth would atrophy and become useless if this child did not see light for about five years. Why? Neural Darwinism. Without the requisite stimulation during the critical period allotted by Nature for the visual system‚Äôs development, the child‚Äôs [[brain]] would never have received the information that being able to see is needed for survival. Irreversible blindness would be the result.
