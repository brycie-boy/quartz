## Addiction

Addiction is any repeated behavior, substance-related or not, in which a person feels compelled to persist, regardless of its negative impact on their life and the lives of others. Addiction involves:

* compulsive engagement with the behavior, a preoccupation with it
* impaired control over the behavior
* persistence or relapse despite evidence of harm
* dissatisfaction, irritability, or intense [craving](Craving.md) when the object—be it a drug, activity, or other goal—is not immediately available.
* Compulsion, impaired control, persistence, irritability, relapse, and [craving](Craving.md)
