## The formless attainments

The formless attainments are four meditative states that continue the mental unification of [the jhanas](The%20jhanas.md). They're distinguished from [the jhanas](The%20jhanas.md) by there transendance of the object of concentration. These are:

* [The base of the infinity of space](The%20base%20of%20the%20infinity%20of%20space.md)
* [The base of the infinity of consiousness](The%20base%20of%20the%20infinity%20of%20consiousness.md)
* [The base of nothingness]()
* [The base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception](The%20base%20of%20neither-perception-nor-nonperception.md)
