## Stress causes the amygdala and HPA axis to quite the prefrontal cortex by flooding it with dopamine and cortisol #🧠 

[[Amygdala activity triggers the VTA to release dopamine]]. In a stressful situation, the [[amygdala]] and [[HPA axis]] command  [[dopamine]] and [[cortisol]]. These flood the [[prefrontal cortex]] and silence it, which in turn disinhibits you. This compromises your capacity to make good decisions. You struggle to differentiate between immediate or [[delayed gratification]] and you’re much more likely to react on impulse.
