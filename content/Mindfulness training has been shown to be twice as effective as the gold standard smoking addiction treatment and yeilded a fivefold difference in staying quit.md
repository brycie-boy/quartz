## Mindfulness training has been shown to be twice as effective as the gold standard smoking addiction treatment and yeilded a fivefold difference in staying quit

Over two years, Dr. [Judson Brewer]() and his team had screened over 750 people and had randomized just fewer than 100 in their [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) trial. When the final subjects completed the four-month follow-up visits, they took all the data and looked to see how well [Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) training had stacked up against gold standard smoking addiction treatment. The data showed that the participants of the [Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) training group had quit at twice the rate of the Freedom From Smoking group. Additionally, nearly all of the [Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) training participants had stayed quit, while many of those in the other group had lost ground, yeilding a fivefold difference between the two.
