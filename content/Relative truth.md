## Relative truth #🧠 

[[When a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challenges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain]]. [[The scientific method cannot lead to certainty, but only high probability]]. [[Things that philosophers thought they knew through pure reason often ended up being wrong]]. Therefor we can never establish absolute truth. However, absolute falsity _can_ be established since a statement in its absolute form is falsified once an single exception to it is found. If we except this view, then "true" and "false" becomes relative to our knowledge at a particular time in history and should be modified to at least "relatively true" or "absolutely false."
