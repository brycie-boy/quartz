## Relative truth #üß†

[When a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challenges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain](When%20a%20system%20of%20thought%20becomes%20less%20than%20totally%20trivial,%20an%20infinite%20regress%20of%20challenges%20manifest%20and%20it%20becomes%20increasingly%20uncertain.md). [The scientific method cannot lead to certainty, but only high probability](The%20scientific%20method%20cannot%20lead%20to%20certainty,%20but%20only%20high%20probability.md). [Things that philosophers thought they knew through pure reason often ended up being wrong](Things%20that%20philosophers%20thought%20they%20knew%20through%20pure%20reason%20often%20ended%20up%20being%20wrong.md). Therefor we can never establish absolute truth. However, absolute falsity *can* be established since a statement in its absolute form is falsified once an single exception to it is found. If we except this view, then "true" and "false" becomes relative to our knowledge at a particular time in history and should be modified to at least "relatively true" or "absolutely false."
