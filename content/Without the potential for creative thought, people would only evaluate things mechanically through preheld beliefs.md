## Without the potential for creative thought, people would only evaluate things mechanically through preheld beliefs #üß† 

It appears that, over the aeons, some domesticated primates have noticed that [[we generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs]] and have developed the ability to do so themselves. The members of this group cannot be mechanically predicted. They operate in [[intelligent mode]]. At times they may exhibit the characteristics we refer to as "growth" or "creativity." And it also appears that [[Idolatry]] and [[Fundamentalism]] can be biologically described as normal mammalian behavior‚Äî[[subjective bias]] combined with the fact that [[people have a tendency to become territorial over their belief systems]]. In that case, unless any real possibility of creative thought exists, only mechanical [[predictive coding]] will determine how we evaluate any incident or event. 

We often do not look at the world closely enough. We follow [[habit]]ual programs so often that we forget to exercise our potential creativity. We should therefor make an effort to look at the things which we ordinarily ignore and dismiss without placing one of our habitual [[idol]]s in the way of our vision.
