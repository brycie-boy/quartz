## Friendly strength  # 

Freindly Strength (The Good Parent) is one of [[the four quadrants]]. This type was known in the medieval psychology of ‚Äúhumours‚Äù as Sanguinary. It was identified with the Lion archetype and [[the fire element]]. The Lion, because of the dignity of these big cats, represents ‚Äúgood‚Äù strength, and the fire represents power. In [[Transactional Psychology]], this type is catagorized by the life script: "I'm ok, you're ok." These types virtually never comes for psychotherapy. He or she is satisfied with his or her life, and so is the rest of society. Alas, they nonetheless can get to the position where they need therapy of some sort, simply because they may take on too much responsibility and carry too many burdens. They will generally arrive at the therapists only if sent there by an M.D. who has intuited where their ulcers came from. This type is associated with the evangelist [[Mark]] and the [[astroligical sign]] [[Libra]].

According to the [[Leary Interpersonal Grid]], a typical example of this type is Responsible/Over-Conventional. Everybody agrees that they are usually a beloved community leader‚Äîhelpful, considerate, friendly and solidly successful. Some may even say they spoil people with kindness, forgives anything, agrees with everybody and actually enjoys governing those who cannot govern themselves. The noble Lion. This person may be (and probably is) a total robot. That is, if they can never give orders in a strict way, is never able to doubt others, is never ego-centered, etc. then they have mechanically [[imprint]]ed friendly strength. On the other hand, if they are able to move out of friendly strength in appropriate situations (exercizing hostility against the marauder or predator, admitting weakness when overwhelmed), they have an [[imprint]]ed or [[Conditioning|conditioned]] predilection for ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, you‚Äôre okay,‚Äù but is not totally robotized by it.
