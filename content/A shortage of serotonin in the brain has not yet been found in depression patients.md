## A shortage of serotonin in the brain has not yet been found in depression patients

In a study of eight [depressed](Depression.md) patients (all of whom had been previously exposed to [antidepressant]()s), Dr. [Malcom Bowers]() and his team had announced that their [5-HIAA]() levels were lower than normal, but not ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù so. Two years later, investigators at McGill University said that they, too, had failed to find a ‚Äústatistically significant‚Äù difference in the [5-HIAA]() levels of depressed patients and normal controls, and that they also had failed to find any correlation between [5-HIAA]() levels and the severity of depressive symptoms. In 1974, Bowers was back with a more finely tuned follow-up study: [Depressed](Depression.md) patients who had not been exposed to antidepressants had perfectly normal [5-HIAA]() levels.
