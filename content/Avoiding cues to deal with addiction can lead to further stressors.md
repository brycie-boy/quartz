## Avoiding cues to deal with addiction can lead to further stressors

Avoiding [operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md) cues might help prevent people from being triggered, but does not directly target the core [habit](Habit.md) loop. For example, staying away from friends who smoke can be helpful. Yet if getting yelled at by the boss triggered someone to smoke, avoiding the boss might lead to other [stressor](Stressor.md)s, such as unemployment. This is one reason why traditional methods of behavior change usually fail.
