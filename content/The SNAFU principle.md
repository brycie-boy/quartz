## The SNAFU principle

Mammalian sociobiology, rooted in the antique neural circuits of the the [Emotional-Territorial Circuit](Emotional-Territorial%20Circuit.md), contains many factors opposing the evolution of domesticated primates into true freedom and objective intelligence. The chief of these ‚Äúreactionary‚Äù factors are described by [Robert Anton Wilson]() as the SNAFU Principle. It holds that communication is only possible between equals. Or more precisely, that adequate communication flows freely between equals. Communication between non-equals is warped and distorted by primative domination and submission instincts perpetuating communication jam and a Game Without End.

Political power, as a typical alpha male once said, grows out of the barrel of a gun. This is metaphorically as well as literally true. The "gun" may be symbolic and fairly abstract, consisting of rituallilzed social expectations ("Dont talk back to your father") or concrete in a non-violent but deadly way, for example, the capacity to remove bio-survival by cutting off the ticket supply in a Capitalist society ("One more word and i'll fire you, bumstead!"). Under such primate socio-biological rules, everybody tends to lie a little, to flatter or to evade displeaser, when exchanging signals with those above them in the pack hierarchy.
