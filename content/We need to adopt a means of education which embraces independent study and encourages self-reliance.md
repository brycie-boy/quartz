## We need to adopt a means of education which embraces independent study and encourages self-reliance # 

We should look to the past to regain an educational philosophy that works. One I like particularly well has been a favorite of the ruling classes of Europe for thousands of years. At the core of this elite system of education is the belief that self-knowledge is the only basis of true knowledge. Everywhere in this system, at every age, you will find arrangements that work to place the child alone in an unguided setting with a problem to solve. Sometimes the problem is fraught with great risks, such as the problem of galloping a horse or making it jump, but that, of course, is a problem successfully solved by thousands of elite children before the age of ten. Can you imagine anyone who had mastered such a challenge ever lacking confidence in his ability to do anything?

Right now we are taking from our children all the time that they need to develop self-knowledge. That has to stop. We have to invent school experiences that give a lot of that time back. We need to trust children from a very early age with independent study, perhaps arranged in school, but that takes place away from the institutional setting. We need to invent curricula where each kid has a chance to develop private uniqueness and self-reliance. We‚Äôve got to give kids independent time right away because that is the key to self-knowledge, and we must reinvolve them with the real world as fast as possible so that their independent time can be spent on something other than abstraction.

Independent study, community service, adventures and experience, large doses of privacy and solitude, a thousand different apprenticeships‚Äîthe one-day variety or longer‚Äîthese are all powerful, cheap, and effective ways to start a real reform of schooling.
