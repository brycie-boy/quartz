## High-entropy state # 

High entropy mental states refer a more anarchic form of the human or protohuman [[brain]] which may be called primary [[consciousness]], and which contrasts with [[low-entropy state]]. This state of mind includes [[psychedelic]] states, [[expanded consciousness]], [[lantern consciousness]], infant [[consciousness]]; early psychosis; magical thinking; and [[divergent thinking]]. It is primarily characterized by “magical thinking”—beliefs about the world that have been shaped by wishes and fears and supernatural interpretation. 

- In primary [[consciousness]], cognition is less meticulous in its sampling of the external world and is instead easily biased by emotion, e.g., wishes and anxieties. 
- wait a minute. Bias implies being drawn toward repetitive behaviors or beliefs. Sounds pretty low entropy to me. If anything it sounds more like a high entropy state would allow us see the world with less preconceptions

Magical thinking is one way for human minds to reduce their uncertainty about the world, but it is less than optimal for the success of the species.
