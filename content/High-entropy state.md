## High-entropy state

High entropy mental states refer a more anarchic form of the human or protohuman [brain](Brain.md) which may be called primary [consciousness](Consciousness.md), and which lies in contrast with a [low-entropy state](Low-entropy%20state.md). This state of mind includes [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md) states, [expanded consciousness](Expanded%20consciousness.md), [lantern consciousness](Lantern%20consciousness.md), infant [consciousness](Consciousness.md); early psychosis; magical thinking; and [divergent thinking](DIvergent%20thinking.md). It is primarily characterized by “magical thinking”—beliefs about the world that have been shaped by wishes and fears and supernatural interpretation. In primary [consciousness](Consciousness.md), cognition is less meticulous in its sampling of the external world and is instead easily biased by emotion, e.g., wishes and anxieties. Magical thinking is one way for human minds to reduce their uncertainty about the world, but it is less than optimal for the success of the species.
