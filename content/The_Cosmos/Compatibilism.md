## Compatibilism  # 

Compatibilism is the belief that [[free will]] and [[determininsm]] are mutually compatible and that it is possible to beleive in both without being logically inconsistent. Compatibilists believe that freedom can be present or absent in situations for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. They say that causal determinism does not exclude the truth of possible future outcomes.
