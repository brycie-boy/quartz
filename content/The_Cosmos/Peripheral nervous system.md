## Peripheral nervous system  # 

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two components that make of the [[nervous system]]. The PNS consists of [[neuron]]s that lie outside of the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. The main function of the PNS is to connect the [[Central Nervous system|CNS]] to the limbs and organs, including the [[six sense bases|sense organs]], essentially serving as a relay between the [[brain ]]and [[spinal cord]] and the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system can be devided into the [[somatic nervous system]] and the [[autonomic nervous system]].
