## You should follow your own morality even if it means the disapproval of society # 

[[Values can only be considered truly valid until one witnesses their value for themselves]]. We should speak the rude truth under all circumstances. This may seem harsh, but your goodness must have some edge to it, otherwise it is just [[enabling]]. People should take care of those for whom they genuinely care about rather than engage in deeds because conventional [[morality]] says we must do it. Sometimes we may submit to societal expectations of goodness, but such [[conformity]] is wicked because it doesn't arise from our own sense of right and wrong.

[[The only taboo shared by each civilization is letting people determine their own taboos]], so virtues are generally the exception than the rule. People do what is called good much as they would pay a fine in expiation. Their deeds are an apology or extenuation for living in society. We must do right by our own conscience, even if doing so means disapproval of society. We should try to live after what our own minds tells us is right, and not what looks pleasing to society at large.

What you must do should be all that concerns you, not what people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the entire distinction between greatness and meanness. It's harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world‚Äôs opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but an exceptional individual is one who in the midst of the crowd maintains the independence of solitude. The development of [[equanimity]] may help us with withstand the difficulty of this task.
