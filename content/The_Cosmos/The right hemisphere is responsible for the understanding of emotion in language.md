## The right hemisphere is responsible for the understanding of emotion in language  # 

When it comes to the understanding (and expression) of emotion in language, again, despite [[left hemisphere]] preponderance for language, the [[right hemisphere]] is superior. Emotional language may be possible even when speech is lost through a [[left hemisphere]] stroke. It is the [[right hemisphere]] that understands the emotional or the humorous aspect of a narrative. Memory for emotional language is in the right [[hemisphere]]. Ultimately there is clear evidence that when it comes to recognising emotion, whatever it may be, whether it is expressed in language or through facial expression, it is the [[right hemisphere]] on which we principally rely.
