Since [[the right hemisphere has a more loose orginazational structure than the left hemisphere]], it is also better able to integrate perceptual processes, particularly bringing together different kinds of information from different senses. There is evidence from [[brain]]-damaged war veterans that confirms the difference between the [[left hemisphere]]'s focal organisation and the [[right hemisphere]]'s more profuse and diffusely organised structure, and indicates that this may be why the [[right hemisphere]] has the advantage in constructing a richly diverse three-dimensional world in space. 

We would expect on first principles that having widely different kinds of functions grouped together in the more diffusely organised [[right hemisphere]] should lead to a different quality of integration from that characteristic of the more focally organised [[left hemisphere]]: there would be a greater convergence of disparate types of information, and one might predict a bringing together in consciousness different elements, including information from the ears, eyes, and other sensory organs, and from memory, so as to generate the richly complex, but coherent, world we experience. By contrast, the left hemisphere would be inadequate for the more rapid complex syntheses achieved by the [[right hemisphere]].
