## Gluconeogenesis removes the brains need for carbohydrate consumption  # 

It is true that certain portions of the [[brain]] do require some [[glucose]], but this [[glucose]] does not have to come from your diet, it can come from the process of [[gluconeogenesis]]. The rest of your [[brain]] can utilize [[ketone]]s for fuel, and in fact, the [[brain]] likely prefers [[ketone]]s. Since [[ketones provide more energy to the brain than glucose]], [[ketone]]s are taken up via the [[brain]] in proportion to their availability in the blood. The [[liver]] can produce between 100 and 150 grams of [[ketone]]s per day, which is more than enough to meet the energy demands of the [[brain]]. This means that the [[brain]] can derive all of the energy it needs from [[ketone]]s and [[gluconeogenesis]], removing the need for carbohydrate consumption.
