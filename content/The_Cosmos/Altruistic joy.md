## Altruistic joy  # 

In Buddhism, altruistic joy refers to the feeling of happiness for the success and good fortune of others. It should not be confused with pride, as a person feeling mudita may not have any benefit or direct income from the accomplishments of the other. Atruistic joy is a pure joy unadulterated by self-interest.
