- ❗️delete the repo and try to add the vault by itself. At that point, you will know wether or not it is worth switching syncing methods

___

- copy vault out of quarts content folder
- Maybeee you can make your vault public and gitignore the ones you want private, then just use them on your phone
- maybe you can try unhooking your vault to GitHub and use the non-repoed folder, then you can try to figure out how to sync back
- on https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=BTN6hJ65qk8, ask “don’t you use quartz? Won’t privating that repo make it unusable for quartz?”

___

- switch syncing methods
- Try to publish non-repoed file
- If that doesn’t work and no one answers why, then you can probably say “I’d really appreciate a response”
