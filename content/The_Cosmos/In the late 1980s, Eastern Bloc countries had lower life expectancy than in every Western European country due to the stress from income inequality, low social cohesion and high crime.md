## In the late 1980s, Eastern Bloc countries had lower life expectancy than in every Western European country due to the stress from income inequality, low social cohesion and high crime # 

So first off, [[the low social capital that comes with income inequality can lead to more stress and poor health]]. Then, [[the higher crime rate that comes with income inequality results in more physical and psychological stress among society]]. And finally, [[more income inequality means that the wealthy will spend more money on their own private goods, leading to more stress among the public]]. So we‚Äôve got income inequality, low social cohesion and [[social capital]], class tensions, and lots of crime all forming an unhealthy cluster. Let‚Äôs see a grim example of how these pieces come together. 

By the late 1980s, life expectancy in Eastern Bloc countries was less than in every Western European country. As analyzed by Evans, these were societies in which there was a fair equity of income distribution, but a highly unequal distribution of freedoms of movement, speech, practice of beliefs, and so on. And what has happened to Russia since the dissolution of the Soviet Union? A massive increase in income inequality and crime, a decline in absolute wealth‚Äîand an overall decline in life expectancy that is unprecedented in an industrialized society.
