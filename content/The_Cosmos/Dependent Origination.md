## Dependent Origination # 

Dependent Origination is a doctrine which states that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other phenomena. As [[The Buddha]] puts it: "if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist." Thus no entity or event is isolated and self-enclosed but is inherently linked to other things in a complex web of dependently originated processes. I believe this to be the perspective of the [[right hemisphere]], since [[the right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities]]. [[The Nikayas]] typically expound the doctrine of Dependent Origination through [[the twelve links of Dependent Origination]].
