## The right hemisphere attends to the personal, while the left focuses on the abstract and impersonal  # 

Because [[the right hemisphere sees things in their context]], it is interested in the personal, by contrast with the [[left hemisphere]], which has more affinity for the abstract or impersonal. The [[right hemisphere]]'s view of the world in general is construed according to what is of concern to it, not according to objective impersonal categories, and therefore has a personal quality. This is both its strength and its weakness in relation to the [[left hemisphere]]. It deals preferentially with whatever is approaching it, drawing near, into relationship with it. The right [[temporal lobe]] deals preferentially with memory of a personal or emotionally charged nature, what is called episodic memory, where the left [[temporal lobe]] is more concerned with memory for facts that are in the public domain.
