## We generally struggle to examine and criticize our own beliefs and perceptions  #üß† 

[[Mark Twain]] once remarked that anti-semitism reminded him of a cat he knew who sat on a stove once and never sat on a stove again. "Whats wrong with that?" asked an anti-semite, falling into Twains trap. "The stupid cat never sat on a cold stove either," Twain replied. This illustrates the generalization that most mammals are incapable of criticizing or examining there own neural programs. To a mammilian animal, some act or event or thing that seemed "bad" once will always seem "bad" and it, or anything that looks like it, will be attacked or fled. Such programs are created by the processes known as [[imprint]]ing and [[conditioning]], which leads to [[subjective bias]]. Domesticated primates, being mammals themselves, also seem to function largely on [[imprint]]ing and [[conditioning]], and mostly share the same mammilian innability to criticize or examine their neural programs. 

These mechanical programs interact with a linguistic [[reality tunnel]] to produce a characteristic vocabulary, from which behavior can often be predicted mechanically. If one hears the language of the Ku Klux Klan, then they might predict how a black human would be treated by that group. If one hears the language of Radical Feminism, they might predict how a male human would be regarded by that group. If one hears the language of [[Fundamentalism|Fundamentalist]] [[Materialism|Materialists]], they might predict how a [[remote viewing]] report will be recieved. Etc.
