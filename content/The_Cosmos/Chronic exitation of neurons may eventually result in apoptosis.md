## Chronic exitation of neurons may eventually result in apoptosis  #🧠 

When [[neurotransmitter]]s bludgeon the receiving [[neuron]] en masse and without cessation, they can overstimulate and eventually kill that [[neuron]] through [[apoptosis]].  Chronic excitation of almost any [[neuron]] can lead to [[cell]] death. This is a common phenomenon in neuroscience, and it’s a necessary process. Drugs can do both: they can poison the [[cell]] outright, or they can beat it into permanent submission.
