## By embracing reliability of definitional criteria, the DSM has become overreliant on using simple checklists to diagnose people # 

[[The DSM has to prioritize reliability when defining mental disorders to prevent disagreement, which sacrifices validity]], so the [[DSM]] has to stay simple, but psychiatry does not. [[DSM]] diagnosis should be seen as just one small part of an overall evaluation that would also comprehensively account for the more complicated and individual aspects of each patient. Unfortunately, the [[DSM]] approach has been far too influential‚Äîdominating the field in a way that was never originally intended. Nuanced psychiatry has become checklist psychiatry, homogenizing individual differences and custom-tailored treatments. Psychiatry, once too idiosyncratic and chaotic, has become too standardized and simpleminded. Training programs focus excessive attention on teaching diagnosis and not enough on understanding everything else about the patient. People forget the wisdom of Hippocrates: ‚ÄúIt is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.‚Äù Of course, best practice is to pay close attention to both. [[DSM]] diagnosis has a necessary place in every evaluation, but it never tells the whole story.
