## The consciousness element  #⏳ 

When all other elements have been viewed through [[the three characteristics]], there remaines the concsiousness element, which is one of the additional two of [[the great elements]]. The consciousness element is used to cognize [[feeling]] and the arising and passing of [[sense impression]]s which these [[feeling]]s are dependent.
