## Proposition  # 

In philosophy, a proposition is often characterized as the bearer of truth or falsity. Propositions are also often characterized as being the kind of thing that [[declartative sentence]]s denote. For instance the sentence "The sky is blue" denotes the proposition that the sky is blue.
