## The limbic system is programmed to seek a cormfort-safety zone around a mothering organism  # 

The [[limbic system]] is [[DNA]]-programmed to seek a comfort-safety zone around a mothering organism. If a mother isn‚Äôt present, the closest substitute in the environment will be [[imprint]]ed. [[The limbic system imprints through breastfeeding]], and how important is this oral [[imprint]]ing? We read of a baby giraffe whose mother was accidentally killed by a jeep immediately after birth. The neonate, following hard-wired genetic programs, [[imprint]]ed the first object that roughly fit the giraffe archetype‚Äîthe jeep itself. He followed the machine around, vocalized to it, attempted to suckle from it, and, when adult, tried to mate with it. Similarly, [[Konrad Lorenz]] tells of a gosling who accidentally [[imprint]]ed a ping-pong ball and spent his adult life, indifferent to female geese, attempting to sexually mount ping-pong balls.
