Norns are deities in Norse mythology responsible for shaping the course of human destinies.

- One of the foremost techniques they use to shape fate is carving runes into Yggdrasil’s trunk. The symbols then carry these intentions throughout the tree, affecting everything
- [[Our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]]
- [[Default mode network]]
- Shaping destinies:
    - [[Without the potential for creative thought, people would only evaluate things through mechanical perceptual programs]]
    - [[The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]]
    - [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]]
