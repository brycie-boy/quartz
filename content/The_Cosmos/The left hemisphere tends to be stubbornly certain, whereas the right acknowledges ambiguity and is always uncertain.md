## The left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain # 

[[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]], so the [[left hemisphere]] likes things that are man-made. Things that we make are more certain: we know them inside out, because we put them together. They're not, like living things, constantly changing and moving, beyond our grasp. Also, [[the left hemisphere filters and represents experience according to its preconfigured system of classification, and the right attends to everything outside of this process without preconceptions]]. Because the [[right hemisphere]] sees things as they are, they're constantly new for it, so it has nothing like the databank of information about categories that the [[left hemisphere]] has. [[The right hemisphere sees the whole before the left hemisphere separates it into parts]], and [[the right hemisphere is responsible for our sense of time as continuous and unified]]. It cannot have the certainty of knowledge that comes from being able to fix things and isolate them. In order to remain true to what is, it does not form abstractions, and categories that are based on abstraction, which are the strengths of denotative language. 

By contrast, the [[right hemisphere]]'s interest in language lies in all the things that help to take it beyond the limiting effects of denotation to connotation: it acknowledges the importance of ambiguity. It therefore is virtually silent, relatively shifting and always uncertain‚Äîit is [[Model Agnosticism|model agnostic]]‚Äîwhere the [[left hemisphere]], by contrast, may be unreasonably, even stubbornly, convinced of its own correctness‚Äîit is [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. As [[John Cutting]] puts it, despite ‚Äòan astonishing degree of ignorance on the part of the left (supposed major) hemisphere about what its partner, the right (supposed minor) hemisphere, [is] up to, [it] abrogates decision-making to itself in the absence of any rational evidence as to what is going on‚Äô.
