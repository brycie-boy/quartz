## The fourth jhana  #⏳ 

The fourth of [[the jhanas]] involves the abandoning of pleasure and pain and the purification of [[mindfulness]] by [[equanimity]]. 

From the fourth jhana, three lines of development become possible. The first line is the [[the formless attainments]]. The second line is the acquisition of [[supernormal powers]]. The third line is the knowledge of the destruction of [[the taints]].
