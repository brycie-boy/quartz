## Each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty  # 

In existentialist and humanist models‚Äîmodels influenced by the thought and experiments of researchers such as Maslow, Sullivan, Ames, Perls, Leary, Krippner, and many others‚Äîthe human being is seen as both [[in-DIVIDE-ual]] and [[in-UNITE-ual]], separated in some ways but connected with all things in other ways.

[[Because perception is not absolute, our models of reality are all somewhat conjectural and inferential]]. Therefor, according to existential-humanist psychology, where the [[Materialism|materialist]] says "I perceive," It would be more correct to say _"I am making a bet_." Concretely, in [[the cock-eyed room]], we make a bets that we are seeing something familiar to us. If allowed in the room and asked to touch a corner of the ceiling with a pointer, we quickly realize the _gamble_ in every act of perception. Typically, we would hit everything but the corners in our attempts‚Äîthe walls, other parts of the ceiling, etc. A strange thing occurs when we go on trying. Our _perceptions change_‚Äîwe are making a series of bets, one after another‚Äîand gradually we are able to find the corner we are aiming for. 

The same sort of thing happens in any [[psychedelic]] drug experience, which is why existentialist-humanist models became more popular with psychologists after the 1960s. It also occurs through [[mindfulness]] practice‚Äîclearing the mind of its [[habit]]s‚Äîand that is why so many psychologists of this tradition have been involved in researching what happens, physiologically, to those who practice [[mindfulness]]. Both involve the deactivation of the [[default mode network]], which is involved in [[predictive coding]].

When we return to the ordinary world of social interactions after such shocks as [[the cock-eyed room]], [[psychedelic]]s, or [[mindfulness]], we observe that the same processes are going on in others. People are making bets about which model fits best at a given time, but they are not aware of making these bets, since [[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]]. If the models do not fit very well, they do not revise them but instead grow angry at the world for being the culprit. Most typically, they find someone to blame because [[the more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]].
