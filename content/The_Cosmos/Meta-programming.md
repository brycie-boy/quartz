## Meta-programming  # 

[[The brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]]. Thus the human [[brain]] appears much like a very unique self-programming computer. It chooses‚Äîusually unconsciously and mechanically‚Äîthe quality of [[consciousness]] and the [[reality tunnel]] it will employ in order to orchestrate the incoming signals of the experienced world. When the [[brain]] becomes conscious of this unconscious programming, Its creativity becomes truly astounding and is called meta-programming by Dr. [[John Lilly]]. 

[[Our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]]. In meta-programming, the [[brain]] becomes capable of deliberately activating [[lantern consciousness]] and increasing the number of signals consciously apprehended. One looks casually, in the ordinary way, and then looks again and again. Dull objects and boring situations become transformed‚Äîpartly because they were dull and boring only when the [[left hemisphere]] was working on its old mechanical programs‚Äîand the [[Synergy|synergetic]] unity of observer and observation becomes a thrilling experience. Every experience becomes the type of intense learning that usually only occurs in school when cramming for exams. 

Since in the existential world of experience we have to make bets ([[Each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty]]) and choices ([[The experienced world transcends the deterministic views of the fundamentalist]]), we are consciously "cramming" all the time, but there is no special sense of stress or anxiety involved, we are living time instead of passing time.
