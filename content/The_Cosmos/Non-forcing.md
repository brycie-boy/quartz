## Non-forcing  # 

Non-forcing is when one acts spontaneously without [[clinging]] to desired outcomes. Non-forcing is a an example of how [[we can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives]]. When we notice ourselves straining, we can rethink how we are approaching a situation. Neurologically, it involves the [[right hemisphere]], since [[the right hemisphere allows for flexibility in thought and behavior]]. With the successful practice of non-forcing one can achieve [[flow]]. 

Non-forcing is also said to be a behavioral characteristic of the [[Monad]]. In the words of [[Lao Tzu]]: 

> "The softest things [in nature] . . . [overcome] the hardest things . . . That which [lacks] substance enters into that which [lacks] openings. From this I know the benefits of non-forcing"

Water carves through stone simply by following gravity and seeping into its cracks; electricity flows through a block of metal. Thus, the [[Monad]] can permeate all things, even if they appear to be solid, without any cracks or openings. We can extrapolate from this to understand life. The [[Monad]] acts without forcing and achieves effortlessly. We find inspiration in this and see the possibility to act without forcing and achieve great works without friction or resistance.
