## Children, babies, and animals act independently without caring what others will think  # 

Babies, children, and animals are great examples of [[self-reliance]]. They live in [[lantern consciousness]], and have have not been exposed to the demands and customs of their society, and are intuitively aware of their desires, uninhibited by what someone else may think of them. They express themselves with complete authenticity and [[non-forcing]]. Infancy [[Conformity|conform]]s to nobody: all [[Conformity|conform]] to it, so a single baby can make a group of adults prattle and play with _it_. Thus youth, puberty, and adulthood have been armed with its own piquancy and charm, and its claims should not be discarded to quickly, for it stands by itself.

The nonchalance of children who defy authority and do or say whatever conciliates them is the healthy attitude of human nature. The child is independent, irresponsible, and observes from their own perspective people and facts as they pass by. They test them on their merits as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, and troublesome. They do not worry about consequences or interests. They give an independent and genuine verdict. You must court them, they do not court you.

But the adult, having instilled these customs, refrains from following their intuitions. As soon as they have spoken with confidence, they're a committed person who is watched by the sympathy or hatred of hundreds, and whose affections must now enter into their account.
