## Drug users are driven to use simply to make up for the loss of dopamine activity  # 

Just how important [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s are to substance use was illustrated by a study of mice that had previously been trained to drink alcohol. They were given an ‚Äúinfusion‚Äù of [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s right into the [[nucleus accumbens]]. Before the infusion these rodents had fewer than normal [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s, and [[the quantity of dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens neurons determines the magnitude of reward]]. The [[receptor]]s were incorporated into a harmless virus that entered the animals‚Äô [[brain]] [[cell]]s so that, temporarily, a normal range of [[receptor]] activity was achieved. As long as this artificial supply of [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s was available, the mice reduced their alcohol intake considerably‚Äîbut they gradually became boozers again as the implanted [[receptor]]s were lost to natural attrition, which thereby keeps driving the addict to use the drug simply to make up for the loss of [[dopamine]] activity.
