## The poor are less able to plan for the future and can only respond to present stressors # 

Poverty can bring many physical ([[Poverty can bring many physical stressors]]) and psychological ([[Poverty can bring many psychological stressors]]) [[stressor]]s. But being poor means that you often can‚Äôt cope with [[stressor]]s very efficiently. Because you have no resources in reserve, you can never plan for the future, and can only respond to the present crisis. And when you do, your solutions in the present come with a whopping great price later on‚Äîmetaphorically, or maybe not so metaphorically, you‚Äôre always paying the rent with money from a loan shark. Everything has to be reactive, in the moment. Which increases the odds that you‚Äôll be in even worse shape to deal with the next stressor‚Äîgrowing strong from adversity is mostly a luxury for those who are better off.
