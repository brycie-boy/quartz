## Verificationism  # 

Verificationism is the philosophical doctrine which maintains that only statements that are empirically verifiable are cognitively meaningful, or else they are truths of logic. Verificationism thus rejects statements related to metaphysics, as well as fields such as theology, [[ethics]] and aesthetics as "cognitively meaningless". Such statements may be meaningful in influencing emotions or behavior, but not in terms of conveying truth value, information or factual content.
