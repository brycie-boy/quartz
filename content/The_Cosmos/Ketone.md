## Ketone  # 

Ketones are energy molecules produced through the breakdown of [[fat]] in the [[liver]]. Ketones are produced do to the fact that while most of our body can run on [[fat]] for fuel, the [[brain]] cannot. However, the [[liver]] does not possess the necessary enzymes to use ketones for fuel, so they are shuttled out of the [[liver]] and into the blood, where they are able to travel to [[cell]]s and [[tissue]]s and be taken in and used for energy. Many [[cell]]s in the body will skip using ketones for fuel and use [[fat]] instead, allowing the ketones in the bloodstream to be taken in and used by the [[brain]].
