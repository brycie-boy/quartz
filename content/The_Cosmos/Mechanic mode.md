## Mechanic mode  # 

In mechanic mode, we are unobservant and unable to [[jump out of the system]]. We are limited to [[low-temperature search]]es, and thus can only operate strictly within the predetermined rules of a system, and we are willing to wait an infinite length of time for an answer. I believe mechanic mode to be characteristic of the [[left hemisphere]] since [[when solving problems, the left hemisphere tends to rely on a single solution that fits what it already knows]].
