## Cognitive scientists measured learning through observation of natural learning or through tests in controlled settings # 

However, the question was how could you measure their learning? Studying thoughts is tricky. Unlike with behavioral change, which can be seen directly, you can‚Äôt ask a rat how its thinking has changed. Measuring a change in someone‚Äôs thoughts usually involves having to ask them or test them. Psychologists solved this problem in two ways. The first way was through close observations of children learning naturally. Piaget watched his nephew and daughter as they grew and developed an understanding of the world. The other approach was experimental, devising paradigms to look at how well people learnt in controlled situations, or tests to work out what children knew.
