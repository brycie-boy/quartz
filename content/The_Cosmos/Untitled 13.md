I feel like this is the opitome of our left vs right dichotomy. A lot of the left are very anti-religion and pro-hedonism as a sort of reaction to conservatism that's embued with Puritanism, guilt, etc. I think the idea of simply observing the unsatisfactory and painful results of our actions and taking a middle way of moderation can be a really useful concept to the west. The west seems to think there's only compete hedonism or puritanism and no alternative. Probably because the Aristotelian either/or logic the west relies on

Then there's the neurological determinism (which used the same Aristotelian true/false mindset) in the west in which we are slaves to our brain chemistry and physiology and that we can't make choices our selves. Thus there's only either repression or reactivity

It all has to do with arbitrary abstract baseless notions of morality not based in experience. It thus legitimizes punishment because people who think punishment is necessary think that the results aren't enough to convince the person to  avoid actions. And thus just perpetuates the process because punishment never actually leads the person to see why those actions aren't worth pursuing so they're never actually demotivated to do those things. Only experience can do that. When we punish people ourselves, they don't get to experience the actual results of those actions. So they inevitably just repress the desires. 

The west it conceited enough to think that nature isn't a worthy teacher and that we should take up the process of punishment ourselves
