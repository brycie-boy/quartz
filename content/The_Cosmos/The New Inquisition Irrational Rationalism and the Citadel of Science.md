### The Book in 3 Sentences



### Impressions

Classic Wilson. Very transformative book. In this book, Wilson proposes that the inquisition never really went way, but instead switched roles, primarily finding it's place in modern science. This is because the inquisition was not an event, but an attitude. Wilson developes a formalized famework offers a frame work to analyze manifestations of inquisitorial behavior in any line of thought. He also offers many tools to protect oneself from falling into inquisitorial behavior themselves. This book will help you make sense of the world that were living in today and I think everyone should read it.

### Who Should Read It?

Generally anyone who is interested in understanding what is happening in our modern political world.
