## Idolatry  #üß† 

[[If our capacity to impose order onto experience becomes overbearing, it may narrow cognition]], and at it's extreme, it may lead us into idolatry. [[Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]], and [[because perception is not absolute, our models of reality are all somewhat conjectural and inferential]]. Idolatry refers to the stage of semantic innocence when the metaphorical or inferential nature of models is either forgotten or repressed or has not yet been learned. It is the stage of innocence or arrogance in which the fifth stage of [[the five stages of perception]], that is, somebody's edited and final version of perception, or their [[Emic Reality]], is confused with the first stage, the energy-event or [[Etic Reality]] "out there."

To the idolater, things or events "really are" what they appear to be as coded in there favorite [[reality tunnel]]. Any other [[reality tunnel]], however useful it may appear to others in different contexts, must then be either delusory or fraudulent. Anybody who disagrees with the idolater must be, by definition, a loony or a liar. This is the mentality that underlies all inquisitions.
