## The most successful reimprinting techniques for the LImbic System focus on restoring natural breathing  # 

The process in which [[a negative imprint of the LImbic System leads one to see everything as dangerous, hostile and frightening]] is unconscious in three ways. It is unconscious because it is automatic: it happens without thought, as a robot program. It is also unconscious because it began before the infant had language and hence it is pre-verbal, inarticulate, felt rather than considered. And it is unconscious because it is all-over-the-body-at-once. Specifically, it is characterized by the Respiratory Block first noted by [[Wilhelm Reich]]: a chronic muscular armoring that prevents proper, relaxed breathing. Popular speech recognizes this state as ‚Äúbeing up-tight.‚Äù The involves the activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] by triggering the [[stress-fear-memory pathway]] and [[HPA axis]], preparing us for fight-or-flight.

All of the most successful re[[imprint]]ing techniques (therapies) for this kind of chronic anxiety work on the body first, not on the ‚Äúmind.‚Äù [[Konrad Lorenz]] acquired his marvelous insights into the [[imprint]]ing process by consciously imitating the body movements of the animals he was studying. Even earlier, [[Wilhelm Reich]] discovered that he could understand his patients with remarkable clarity by imitating their characteristic body movements and postures. This is why all schools of yoga place such emphasis on restoring natural breathing before trying to move the student on to [[The eight circuits of consciousness|higher circuits]] and wider [[consciousness]]. It is also why [[serenity]] is the basis for [[insight]]. Deep breathing activates the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. These two wings of the [[autonomic nervous system]] are connected like a seesaw: when one goes up, the other one goes down.
