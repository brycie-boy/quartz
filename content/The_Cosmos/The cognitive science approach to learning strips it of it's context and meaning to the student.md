## The cognitive science approach to learning strips it of it's context and meaning to the student # 

[[Behaviorism assumes that it is external entities that control learning]], and [[cognitive scientists measured learning through observation of natural learning or through tests in controlled settings]]. Both of these methods are still used today. Psychologists around the world design experiments in order to work out how people learn. These types of experiments frequently involve people learning useless information. It‚Äôs common for studies on memory, for example, to study people memorizing lists, or abstract patterns. This is to avoid the thorny problem of people already knowing the information they are meant to be learning. However, it means that learning is taken out of context and is often devoid of any meaning for the learner. The assumption is that the same factors will come into play when remembering meaningful information. 

In order to do experiments on the processes of learning, psychologists had to ignore many of the things which made learning interesting, and also ignore a lot of what people were actually learning. Cognitive experiments on learning and memory are designed to focus on a particular question and, in order to do that, they simplify the situation down to the absolute basics. They strip learning of context in order to understand the underlying processes. This is useful however if that‚Äôs your aim. But when these theories are applied in education, there‚Äôs a tendency to ignore just how simplified the experiments were. This, i believe, is a major contribution to [[existential frustration]] among students these days. 

Perhaps this is do to a [[left hemisphere]] perspective, as [[the left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context]]. The lack of understanding the emotional context in this understanding of learning may also have to do with how [[the left hemisphere generally remains emotionally neutral]], as well as how [[the right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes]]. I also believe this approach to learning instills the same mentality into students.
