## Humanities greatest innovators are ones who defied social norms and followed their own intuitions  # 

When we encounter an unconventional idea, the sentiment that these ideas instill may be of more value than the idea itself. To trust in your own thought, and to place one's thoughts into the world because we believe they may reveal something universal is what constitutes what we call genius. [[A genius is one who is able to create new semantic maps out of intuition]]. When we speak our truth, our ideas may propagate and be reflected back to us in the future. The highest merit that we ascribe to humanities greatest thinkers is that they did not insist upon the [[social norms]] and beliefs of the day, but rather they spoke what they personally believed and shifted the paradigm. 

People therefor should learn to be [[Self-reliance|self-reliant]] and listen closely to their own intuitions, rather than to [[authority bias]]. Yet, unfortunately, people tend to discard their intuitions because they belong to them. In every original work, we recognize our rejected thoughts and they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to avoid [[appeal to majority|appealing to the majority]] [[Appeal to authority|or to authority]] and to abide by our own intuitions when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, we may hear a stranger say precisely what we have thought and felt in the back of our minds, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another. Also, [[the right hemisphere allows for the recognition uniqueness and familiarity, while the left only re-presents generic categories of things]]. They teach us to listen to our [[right hemisphere]] whenever it detects an anomaly, rather than to appeal to the [[left hemisphere]]s enclosed system of classification.
