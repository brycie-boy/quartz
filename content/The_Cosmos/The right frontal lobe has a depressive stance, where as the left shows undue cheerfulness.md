## The right frontal lobe has a depressive stance, where as the left shows undue cheerfulness # 

The issue of the relationship between [[depression]] and the [[right hemisphere]] is complex. Here more than anywhere one has to take into account the influence of the anterior‚Äìposterior (‚Äòfront‚Äìback‚Äô) axis of the [[brain]], as well as the right‚Äìleft axis. It seems that the polarity of emotional timbre between the two hemispheres is specifically tied to the most highly and lately evolved, most ‚Äòhuman‚Äô parts of the [[brain]], the [[frontal lobe]]s. 

Left anterior lesions are associated with [[depression]], and right anterior lesions associated with ‚Äòundue cheerfulness‚Äô. The closer the [[left hemisphere]] lesion lies to the frontal pole, the greater the depressive symptomatology. For those with [[right hemisphere]] lesions the converse is true: the the further back the lesion, the greater the chance of [[depression]]. This confluence of evidence suggests that the right [[frontal lobe]] has a depressive stance compared with either the left [[frontal lobe]] or its own [[parieto-occipital cortex]]. [[Depression]] per se is probably associated with reduced right posterior activity in addition to increased right frontal activity in most cases, although as one might predict threat monitoring is a right-posterior activity. There is evidence of [[left hemisphere]] over-activity in mania, the polar opposite of [[depression]].
