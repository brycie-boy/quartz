## Psychologists were quick to begin using conditioning on children soon after it's conception # 

Psychologists were quick to see how [[behaviorism]] would work on children. In 1920, [[John B. Watson]] demonstrated [[classical conditioning]] on Little Albert, a nine-month-old baby. He did this by clanging an iron pipe and showing him a rat at the same time, and Little Albert learnt to cry when he saw rats. It wouldn‚Äôt get through a modern ethics committee, particularly since they didn‚Äôt [[Conditioning|decondition]] him afterwards. No one knows what happened to Little Albert but, by 1928, [[John B. Watson|Watson]] was writing manuals on using behavioral principles to bring up children. He considered that there were only three unconditioned emotions: fear, rage and love. Everything else was learnt by [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] principles and therefore parents needed to be careful to condition their child in the right way

[[John B. Watson|Watson]]‚Äôs advice hasn‚Äôt dated well; in particular, his recommendation to interact with your children in a detached, business-like fashion. He did, however, start off a fashion for routine and [[habit]]-forming parenting which still continues today. Get the parent‚Äôs behavior right, was his message. The child will learn the correct behavioral associations, and all will be well. [[Behaviorism assumes that it is external entities that control learning]].
