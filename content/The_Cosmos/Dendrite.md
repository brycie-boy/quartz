## Dendrite  #🧠 

Dendrites are branched extensions of a [[neuron]] that propagate the electrochemical stimulation received from other [[neuron]]s to the  [[soma]] of the [[neuron]] from which the dendrites project. Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream [[neuron]]s (usually from [[axon]]s) via [[synapse]]s which are located at various points throughout the dendritic tree.
