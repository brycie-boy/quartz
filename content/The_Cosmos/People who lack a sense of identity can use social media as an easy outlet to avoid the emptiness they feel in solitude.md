## People who lack a sense of identity can use social media as an easy outlet to avoid the emptiness they feel in solitude  # 

In generations past, those who lack a sense of identity could turning to the comfort and security of friends and family, or take part in social events, to avoid the fact that [[the emptiness and anxiety that people with a weak identity feel becomes more acute during periods of solitude]]. But in the present day we don‚Äôt even need to leave the comfort of our home to find the social connections necessary to block out awareness of our emptiness. Instead we merely need to turn to our phones and immerse ourselves in the virtual worlds of social media. We can even go as far as to construct a pseudo-self to mask over our empty nature. By selectively posting bits of information about our life online we can pretend to be someone we are not and feed off the social validation offered by the others who participate in this game.
