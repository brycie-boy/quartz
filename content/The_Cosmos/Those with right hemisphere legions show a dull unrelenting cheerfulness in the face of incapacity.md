## Those with right hemisphere legions show a dull unrelenting cheerfulness in the face of incapacity # 

Not only do [[those with damage to the right hemisphere lack insight into illness or even denial of it]]. In [[right hemisphere]] lesions, there is not only denial or indifference in the face of incapacity, but sometimes a disturbance of mood ‚Äòreminiscent of the fatuousness of those with frontal lesions: euphoria, joviality, a penchant for feeble puns‚Äô. Remember that [[the right frontal lobe has a depressive stance, where as the left shows undue cheerfulness]]. One of the patients reported by H√©caen and de Ajuriaguerra, who had complete hemi-[[asomatognosia]] caused by a parietal tumour ‚Äòexhibited a surprising joviality, at the same time complaining of a fierce headache.‚Äô
