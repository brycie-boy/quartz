## Reducing sugar intake is a better way to fix high blood pressure than lowering salt  # 

What dietary maneuver can fix [[blood pressure]] even faster? How about sugar restriction? Sugar raises your [[blood pressure]] more than salt. Sugar also causes [[liver]] [[fat]] accumulation, [[insulin resistance]], and increased diastolic [[blood pressure]]. Sugar restriction quite rapidly reduces both systolic and diastolic [[blood pressure]], as long as the patient in question doesn’t have preexisting [[kidney]] disease. So what’s the most effective method of treatment: lowering salt, getting rid of sugar, or taking [[blood pressure]] medication? If you take [[processed food]] out, you’ve lowered salt and sugar, and you wouldn’t need the medicine.

Only 20 percent of a [[glucose]] load enters the [[liver]], and the majority is turned into [[glycogen]] ([[liver]] starch) for storage. A small amount of [[glucose]] will undergo [[glycolysis]] (the first step of [[glucose]] metabolism, which doesn’t need [[oxygen]]) to the breakdown product [[pyruvate]]. [[Pyruvate]] can then enter the [[mitochondria]] to be burned via the [[Krebs cycle]] all the way to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]], capturing energy in the form of the chemical adenosine triphosphate ([[ATP]])—the energy is in the [[phosphate]]s. 

100 percent of a [[fructose]] load enters the [[liver]]. [[Fructose]] leads to loss of [[phosphate]]s from [[ATP]], generating of [[uric acid]], which reduces [[nitric oxide]], your [[blood vessel]]s’ relaxing agent, which leads to [[hypertension]]. Most of the [[fructose]] is turned into [[pyruvate]], the [[mitochondria]] become overwhelmed, and the excess generates [[liver]] [[fat]], which causes [[insulin resistance]]. High [[insulin]] interferes with satiety, driving further consumption.
