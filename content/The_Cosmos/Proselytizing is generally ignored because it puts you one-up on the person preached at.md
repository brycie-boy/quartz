## Proselytizing is generally ignored because it puts you one-up on the person preached at # 

Preaching and proselytizing is bad [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] politics, since it puts you one-up on the person preached-at. You are not one-up unless [[imprint]]ed as such by being an alpha male in the same gene-pool or conditioned ([[Conditioning]]) as such by being a ‚Äúboss‚Äù or other authority-figure. The counter-culture of the 1960‚Äôs, like may other idealistic movements, failed because it did so much preaching from a morally one-up position when nobody had been [[imprint]]ed or conditioned to accept it as one-up.
