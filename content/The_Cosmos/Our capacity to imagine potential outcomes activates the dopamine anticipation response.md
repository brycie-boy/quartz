## Our capacity to imagine potential outcomes activates the dopamine anticipation response  # 

[[Mental simulations evolved to allow us to anticipate potential outcomes and make the best approach]]. But in some instances these same types of simulations get hijacked by the process in which [[a dopamine release occurs when we explore and evaluate the potential value of novel objects and situations]], leading us to spend time ‚Äúelsewhere‚Äù when we should be doing something else. This process is what we ordinarily call daydreaming. Daydreaming is a great example of our attention being diverted from the task at hand. 

Those with an impared [[orbitofrontal cortex]] may have less control over these [[dopamine]] driven daydreams due to imparements in abilities such as the evaluation the emotional significance of stimuili, which strongly influencs what we focus on, as well as capacity to balance short-term objectives against longer-term consequences in the process of decision making.
