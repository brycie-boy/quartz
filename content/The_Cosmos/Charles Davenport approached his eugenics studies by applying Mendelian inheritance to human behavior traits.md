## Charles Davenport approached his eugenics studies by applying Mendelian inheritance to human behavior traits # 

[[At the beginning of the 1900s, Andrew Carnegie had funded Charles Davenport to establish eugenics educational programs in the U.S.]]. [[Charles Davenport|Davenport]] approached his study of human inheritance with a Mendelian understanding of [[gene]]tics ([[Mendelian inheritance]]), and applied this Mendelian model to complex behavioral traits in humans, each trait said to be controlled by a single [[gene]]. Again, [[genetic theories of medical or mental conditions can enable people or society to absolve themselves from responsibility]]. Moreover, he was particularly intent on proving that immigrants and societal misfits were [[gene]]tically inferior, and soon he was confidently writing that people could inherit [[gene]]s for “nomadism,” “shiftlessness,” and “insincerity.” Immigrants from Italy, Greece, Hungary, and other Southeastern European countries had [[germ plasm]] that made them “more given to crimes of larceny, kidnapping, assault, murder, rape and sex-immorality.” Jews inherited [[gene]]s for “thieving” and “prostitution.”
