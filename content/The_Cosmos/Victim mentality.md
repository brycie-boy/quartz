## Victim mentality  # 

Victim mentality is a personality trait in which a person tends to recognize or consider themselves a victim of the negative actions of others, and to behave as if this were the case in the face of contrary evidence of such circumstances. Traits of victim mentality include:

- Constantly blaming other people or situations for feeling miserable
- Possessing a "life is against me" philosophy ([[The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]])
- Feeling powerless to change one's circumstances
- Thinking others are purposely trying to hurt you
- Cynical and pessimistic 
- Enjoyment of sharing one's tragic stories with others
- Having a [[habit]] of blaming, attacking, or accusing loved ones for how they feel
- Constantly putting oneself down
- Believing your the only one being targeted for mistreatment
- Refusing to analyze your beliefs or improving your life
- Finds reasons to complain even when things go well

The victim stance is a powerful one because the victim is always morally right, neither responsible nor accountable, and forever entitled to sympathy.
