## Time-Binding Semantic Circuit exercises  # 

Since we all contain a [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit]], we all need to exercise it regularly.

 1. Make up a schematic diagram of your business or home and try to streamline it for more efficiency. Design a chart that explains the whole universe. Every few years, study a science you know nothing about, at an Adult Education center. And don‚Äôt neglect to play with this circuit: write poems, jingles, fables, proverbs or jokes.

 2. [[Actively try to confront new ideas and events that are opposed to your own beliefs and expectations]]. If you are a Liberal, subscribe to the National Review, the country‚Äôs most intelligent (and witty) conservative magazine, for a year. Each month try to enter their reality-tunnel for a few hours while reading their articles. 
 
 3. If you are a Conservative, subscribe to the New York Review of Books for a year and try to get into their head-space for a few hours a month. 

 4. If you are a Rationalist, subscribe to Fate magazine for a year. 

 5. If you are an occultist, join the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and read their journal, The Skeptical Inquirer, for a year. 

 6. Buy a copy of the Scientific American and read any article in it. Ask the following questions: Why do they sound so sure? Does the data support dogmatism at this point, or is dogma a primate [[habit]] (defending head-space)? Will these theories still be believed in 2011? In 2593? 

 7. Get into a discussion of philosophy with an educated Marxist, an intelligent Moslem and a Japanese businessman at the first opportunity. 

 8. Take a strong stimulant and your mind is racing, find a victim and explain the universe to them, until they are able to escape you. What you experience in this ‚Äúspeed rap‚Äù is what the head of the compulsive Rationalist is always like. This is the verbal circuit gone wild and totally oblivious to information coming in on any other circuit. It explains why most people cannot stand Rationalists. ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù drugs evidently trigger [[neurotransmitter]]s characteristic of the verbal centers of the left cortex.
