## Around the 1960s, cognitive psychologists became dissatisfied with behaviorism for understanding learning and started focusing more on thought  # 

By the 1960s, many psychologists were frustrated with the limits of [[behaviorism]]. It seemed like an overly simplistic way to understand complex human beings. Along came people like [[[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]], who were interested in how people thought, not just how they behaved. [[Behaviorism]] argues that humans learn in response to environmental stimuli; cognitive psychologists acknowledged that, in between the environment and behavior, there was a thinking human being.
