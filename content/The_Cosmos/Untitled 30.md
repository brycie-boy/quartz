- confidence dependant on success in socializing is external and thus conditional. Confidence derived from the fact that you are not afraid to lose friends because you know your life will be fulfilling anyways is intrinsic and unconditional

As a remedy for loneliness, suggestions usually involve things like "just improve your social skills and body languange, "just talking to people more," etc. But the more attention we pay to these behaviors, they more stiff and mechanical they come off. Convincing confidence in body language can only come from a true sense of confidence. This type of advice generally comes from people who have already succeeded in winning validation‚Äîhence their confidence. They say it if these people haven't already tried that yet. It is easy for these kinds of people to say things because these methods tend to work for them, but when it doesn't work for others, it leads to hopelessness. The tension discomfort that is felt during these interations is justified, as they are disingenuous. 

Paradoxically, giving up the desire for relationships is the key to actually developing the authentic and fulfilling relationships we desired in the first place. [[Facing loneliness is necessary to develop a stronger sense of identity]]. Through the identity that you end up cultivating, attraction will naturally occur between you and people that you have things in common with. By knowing who you are, you will know what kinds of people you would want to surround yourself with, and you will find conversations with people who you share common intrests with. [[non-forcing|Non-forced]] relationships will arise naturally by out of these conversations. This cannot occur for those without a solid identity. Fulfiling relationships are not something you look for, they're just something that happens by chance.

And as the chemistry fizzles out, such relationships will naturally drift apart without any attachment, because [[as we self-realize we become more sure of our identity and less reliant of the validation of others]]. You were not friends out of requirement, but because they simply improved the quality of an already fulfilling live. If they do not improve the qualilty of your life, then their would be no purpose in continuiting that relationship anymore.

Any relationships that are not rooted in mutual intrest in each other and involves any sort of attachment generally have other intentions. They may serve to make up for the lack of a secure [[attachment]] figure during childhood, because [[A secure attachment in childhood is necessary for the development of the capacity to be alone]]. Or it is to avoid the fact that [[the emptiness and anxiety that people with a weak identity feel becomes more acute during periods of solitude]].
