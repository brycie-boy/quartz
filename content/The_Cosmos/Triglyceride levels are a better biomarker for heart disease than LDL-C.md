## Triglyceride levels are a better biomarker for heart disease than LDL-C # 

Your fasting [[lipid]] profile test also measures a particle other than [[LDL]], which is much more egregious—[[triglyceride]]s. The level of these particles tells you how your [[liver]] is doing. The high risk ratio for [[triglyceride]]s and [[heart disease]] is 1.8 (meaning that if they’re high, you have an 80 percent increased risk for [[heart attack]]) compared to [[LDL-C]] at 1.3. 

Further, the main reason for high [[triglyceride]]s has nothing to do with [[LDL-C]]; rather, it’s the refined [[carbohydrate]]s and sugars in your diet. Again, the #1 risk factor for [[heart disease]] isn’t [[LDL-C]] (see [[Relatively high LDL-C doesn't usually lead to a heart attack for most people]]); it’s the [[insulin resistance]] of [[metabolic syndrome]], of which [[triglyceride]] is a much better biomarker than [[LDL-C]]. 

In fact, the largest study of [[heart attack]]s in the US revealed that 66 percent of the victims had [[metabolic syndrome]]. And the primary driver? [[Insulin resistance]]. And its primary driver? Our out-of-control sugar consumption. [[Insulin resistance]] can be in part measured by your [[triglyceride]] level, which is a better predictor of death by [[heart attack]] than high [[LDL-C]] ever was.
