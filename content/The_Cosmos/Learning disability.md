## Learning disability  # 

- is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors.
- Given the "difficulty learning in a typical manner", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a "learning difference", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping.
- Note: Again, its a learning disibility when you cant get a child to learn what you think they should learn
