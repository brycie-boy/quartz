## Psychedelics capacity to break habitual thought patterns may help adults be able to entertain new ideas  # 

As we get older, the [[default mode network]] developes and [[consciousness]] narrows. Adults have congealed in their beliefs and are hard to shift, whereas children are more fluid and consequently more willing to entertain new ideas. As [[Lao Tzu]] describes: "A newborn is soft and tender,  [and] a crone, hard and stiff. Plants and animals, in life, are supple and succulent; In death, withered and dry.  So softness and tenderness are attributes of life, and hardness and stiffness, attributes of death." 

If you want to understand what a [[high-entropy state]] is like, all you have to do is have tea with a four-year-old. Or drop a tab of [[LSD]]. Their are many similarities between the phenomenology of the [[psychedelic]] experience and the [[consciousness]] of children: [[high-temperature search]]es, [[lantern consciousness]], [[high-entropy state]]s, magical thinking, and little sense of a self that is continuous over time. Babies and children are basically tripping all the time. 

For the well, [[psychedelic]]s, by introducing more noise or entropy into the [[brain]], might shake people out of their usual patterns of thought—“lubricate cognition,” in Dr. [[Robin Carhart-Harris]]’s words—in ways that might enhance well-being, make us more open and boost creativity. The drugs could help adults achieve the kind of fluid thinking that is second nature to kids, expanding the space of creative possibility. If [[children serve to inject new ideas into the system of cultural evolution]], [[psychedelic]]s might do the same thing for the system of the adult mind.
