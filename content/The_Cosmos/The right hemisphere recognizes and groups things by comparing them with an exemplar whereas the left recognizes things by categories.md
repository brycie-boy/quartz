## The right hemisphere recognizes and groups things by comparing them with an exemplar whereas the left recognizes things by categories  # 

Both [[brain hemisphere]]s are involved in recognition according to the grouping of experience. But how they do this in practice differs in vital respects which have a direct impact on the nature of the world that each brings into being. The [[right hemisphere]]'s version is more global and holistic, based on the recognition of similarity with an ideal exemplar, and on where this is positioned in the context of other examples, whereas the [[left hemisphere]] identifies single features that would place the object in a certain category in the abstract. As a result, where the [[left hemisphere]] utilizes abstract categories, the [[right hemisphere]] operates more effectively using specific exemplars. Functional imaging of the [[brain]] shows that the [[left hemisphere]] takes an invariant view in its representation of objects, where the [[right hemisphere]] uses stored ‚Äòreal world‚Äô views in order to group experience.
