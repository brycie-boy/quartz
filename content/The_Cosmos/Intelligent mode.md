## Intelligent mode  # 

In intelligent mode, we are observant of our behavior and are able to [[jump out of the system]]. We can perform [[high-temperature search]]es; we are allowed to do whatever our intelligence suggests, and can modify the rules of the system to see what that gives. I believe Intelligent mode is characteristic of the [[right hemisphere]] since [[the right hemisphere allows for flexibility in thought and behavior]], and [[the right hemisphere is able to access and hold larger quantities of information]].
