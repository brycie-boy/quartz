## Stress and maternal deprivation in infancy and childhood results in excess cortisol levels  # 

Maternal deprivation and other types of adversity during infancy and childhood result in chronically high levels of [[cortisol]]. In addition to the fact that [[Insufficient social-emotional stimulation in infancy reduces the growth of dopamine neurons and receptors]] by excess [[cortisol]], [[Elevated levels of cortisol can shrink the hippocampus]] and disturbs normal [[brain]] development in many other ways, with lifelong repercussions.10 Another major stress chemical that‚Äôs permanently overproduced after insufficient early maternal contact is [[vasopressin]], which is implicated in high blood pressure.11
