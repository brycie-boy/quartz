## Time-Binding Semantic Circuit  # 

The [[Time-Binding]] Semantic Circuit handles artifacts and makes a [[reality tunnel]] which can be passed on to others, even across generations. These [[reality tunnel]]s may include art, blueprints, words, concepts, tools (with instructions on use transmitted verbally), theories, music, etc.

The semantic circuit allows us to sub-divide things, and reconnect things, at pleasure. There is no end to its busy-busy-busy labeling and packaging of experience. On the personal level, this is the ‚Äúinternal monologue‚Äù identified by [[James Joyce]] in Ulysses. On the historical level, this is the [[time-binding]] function described by [[Alfred Korzybski]]. So-called ‚Äúfuture shock‚Äù has always been with us, since the semantic circuit began functioning somewhere in pre-history. In a symbolizing, calculating, abstracting species, all times are ‚Äútimes of change.‚Äù The process is however accelerating faster as time passes, because the symbolizing faculty is inherently self-augmenting.

Domesticated primates are symbol-using creatures; which means, as the pioneer semanticist, [[Alfred Korzybski]], noted, that those who rule symbols, rule us. If Moses, Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, Jesus and St. Paul can be considered living influences‚Äîand they are: look around the world‚Äîthis is only because their Signal has been carried to us by human symbol systems. These systems include words, artworks, music, rituals and unrecognized rituals (‚Äúgames‚Äù) through which culture is transmitted. Since words contain both denotations (referents in the sensory-existential world) and connotations (emotional tones and poetic or rhetorical hooks), humans can be moved to action even by words which have no real meaning or reference in actuality. This is the mechanism of demagoguery, advertising and much of organized religion.

The semantic circuit seems intimately connected with three dimensionality because [[the left-right polarity between cerebral hemisphere and hand funtioning places us in three-demensional space]]. The semantic circuit involves both [[brain hemisphere]]s, but [[novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar]]. Thus the [[imprint]] sites for this circuit are in the [[left hemisphere]], which is closely linked with the delicate muscles of [[larynx]] and the fine manipulations of right-handed ‚Äúdexterity.‚Äù

In ordinary language, the semantic circuit is usually called ‚Äúthe mind.‚Äù When we say someone ‚Äúhas a good mind,‚Äù we generally mean they have a good mouth, i.e., they use the semantic circuit well.
