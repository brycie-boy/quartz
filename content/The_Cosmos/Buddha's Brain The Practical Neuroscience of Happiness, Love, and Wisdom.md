### The Book in 3 Sentences



### Impressions

Eh its ok. This book is a decent overveiw of what neural mechanisms are invovled in Buddhist practice. Its probably only really good for discovering useful little neuroscience tidbits to take a deeper look at afterwords. Theres too much crappy exersizes and not enough neuroscience. 

I did not like the "love" section of the book. A lot of soft buddhism and idiot compassion was invovled. One of the chapters didn't even contain any neuroscience.

This book also falls victim to oversimplification of the neuroscience that you'll see in various books like this.

You'll have a lot of noshit moments with this book with remarks like: "When you‚Äôre very relaxed, it‚Äôs hard to feel stressed"

Corny overuse of words like "happiness" and "love."

It also has excessive relience on Buddhist terminolgy

This book is mostly your standard self-help book.
