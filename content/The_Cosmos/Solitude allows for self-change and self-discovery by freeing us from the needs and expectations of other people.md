## Solitude allows for self-change and self-discovery by freeing us from the needs and expectations of other people # 

Suppose that one becomes dissatisfied with their habitual selves, or feels that there are areas of experience or self-understanding that they cannot reach. One way of exploring these is to remove oneself from present surroundings and see what emerges. Solitude promotes self-change as it frees us from the needs and expectations of other people and so allows for the inward reflection that is necessary to better learn who we are. But solitude is also the ideal state for the use of our imaginative faculties and it is our imagination that introduces us to the possible and that shows us what we could become.
