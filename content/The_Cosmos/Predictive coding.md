## Predictive coding  # 

In neuroscience, predictive coding refers to the process in which [[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]]. It is the responsibility of the [[left hemisphere]] and the [[default mode network]]. [[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]], and the [[default mode network]] filters out irrelevent signals: [[our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]].
