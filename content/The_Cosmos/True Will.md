## True Will  # 

In Thelema, True Will is a term that is defined either as a person's ultimate purpose in life or as a moment-to-moment path of action that operates in perfect harmony with the Universe. In order to find our True Will, [[we must embrace what makes us unique in order to be able to acquire novel insights]]. True Will does not spring from conscious intent, but from the interplay between the inner most self and the entire universe. Those in touch with their True Will are said to have eliminated or bypassed their false desires, conflicts, and [[habit]]s, and accessed their connection with the divine. At this point, they act by [[non-forcing]] and in alignment with nature, just as a stream flows downhill, with neither resistance nor "lust of result."

The True Will is not the simple will of the [[ego]] or the whim of the personality. This is not merely ‚Äúwanting something.‚Äù It is a deeper level of life purpose. The True Will is the will of the deepest inmost Self‚Äîthe core of who you really are as a person. "Do what thou wilt"¬†refers not to¬†[[hedonism]], or to fulfilling carnal desires, but to acting in accordance to our calling.

When a person follows their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them. Also, and importantly, it is an expression of the universal will, as particularized and expressed in your individual life. This is why, when we are living in accordance with our True Will, we find that much of the time the universe seems to open up a path right in front of us, as if in sympathy with our aims. 

Likewise, when we feel as though we are swimming upstream against life it is very often the case that we have veered a bit from the path of our True Will; or perhaps we‚Äôre receiving a lesson from the [[Holy Gaurdian Angel]] and/or the universe itself that is helping to nudge us back onto the path. In order for the individual to be able to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially-instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via [[deconditioning]].
