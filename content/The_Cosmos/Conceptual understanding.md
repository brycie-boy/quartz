## Conceptual understanding  #⏳ 

Conceptual understanding is the correct understanding of a concept arrived by study and examination of that concept in depth. Such understanding is by no means dry and sterile. When rooted in a faith in the worth of the concept and a strong determination to understand it, it serves the germ from which [[experiential understanding]] evolves.
