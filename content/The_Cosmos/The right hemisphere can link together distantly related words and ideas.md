## The right hemisphere can link together distantly related words and ideas # 

This difference in the [[brain hemisphere]]s are not predicated on any of the old distinctions such as verbal versus visuospatial. It operates equally in the realm of attention to verbal information. The [[left hemisphere]] actively narrows its attentional focus to highly related words while the [[right hemisphere]] activates a broader range of words. The [[left hemisphere]] operates focally, suppressing meanings that are not currently relevant. By contrast, the [[right hemisphere]] processes information in a non-focal manner with widespread activation of related meanings. Whereas close lexical semantic relationships rely more on the [[left hemisphere]], looser semantic associations rely on the right. 

Because the [[right hemisphere]] makes infrequent or distantly related word meanings available, there is increased [[right hemisphere]] involvement when generating unusual or distantly related words or novel uses for objects. This may be one of many aspects that tend to associate the [[right hemisphere]] with a freer, more ‚Äòcreative‚Äô style. The right [[anterior temporal region]] is associated with [[Po]] thinking, and the right [[posterior superior temporal sulcus]] may be selectively involved in verbal creativity. In the ‚Äòclose‚Äô situation, by contrast, the [[left hemisphere]] actively suppresses the right, to exclude associations which are semantically only distantly related.
