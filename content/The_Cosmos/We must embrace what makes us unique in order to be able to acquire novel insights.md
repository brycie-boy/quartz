## We must embrace what makes us unique in order to be able to acquire novel insights # 

[[Humanities greatest innovators are ones who defied social norms and followed their own intuitions]]. Every individual has a moment in their lives when they recognize that envy is ignorance, that imitation is the end of innovation, that we must embrace ourselves, and that though the Universe is full of good, no reward shall be reaped but through the work one does with the unique circumstances they've been given. Each person has to do their own work to discover themselves and the value that is in the world. Though this power in them is new, nobody knows what they are truly capable of, nor do they know until they have tried.

[[The right hemisphere allows for the recognition uniqueness and familiarity, while the left only re-presents generic categories of things]]. Every person is unique by the design of the Universe, but we only half express ourselves, and our [[left hemisphere]] finds shame in our uniqueness. Short term, this may _seem_ to be of our benefit, but new insights will never fall upon those who are not brave enough to embrace what makes them unique. We would be elated if we have put our heart into our work and have done our best; but what we have said or done otherwise shall give us no peace. It is a deliverance that does not deliver. And in the attempt their originality deserts them; all creativity ceases, because [[without the potential for creative thought, people would only evaluate things through mechanical perceptual programs]] of the [[left hemisphere]].

We must trust ourselves above all others. One must recognize that every person¬†has a unique role to play in the design of the Universe and in the environment they have been placed. The people we call great are the ones who have most effectively had that recognition, so people should not be afraid to make whatever their individual contribution is if they are to participate in improving the world. Those who succeed in finding their unique role find their [[True Will]].
