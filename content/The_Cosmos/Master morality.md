## Master morality  # 

Master morality is the type of ethics of the ruling class and involves [[friendly strength]] and [[hostile strength]] types. Indeed, [[Hostile Strength]] is the embodiment of Nietzsche’s “Blond Beast,” the primitive conqueror-pirate type we find at the dawn of every civilization. This is what Nietzsche also called the “animal” or “unsublimated" form of the Will to Power.
