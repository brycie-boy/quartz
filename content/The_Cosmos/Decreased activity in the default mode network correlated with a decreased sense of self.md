## Decreased activity in the default mode network correlated with a decreased sense of self  # 

Most of us consider [[Identity view]] as an unshakable given, as real as anything we know, and as the foundation of our life as conscious human beings. One of Dr. [[Robert Carhart-Harris]]’s first experiments with [[psychedelic]]s was that the steepest drops in [[default mode network]] activity correlated with his volunteers’ subjective experience of “[[ego]] dissolution.” (“I existed only as an idea or concept,” one volunteer reported. Recalled another, “I didn’t know where I ended and my surroundings began.”) The more precipitous the drop-off in blood flow and oxygen consumption in the [[default mode network]], the more likely a volunteer was to report the loss of a sense of self. The transcendence of self reported by expert meditators showed up on fMRIs as a quieting of the default mode network. It appears that when activity in the [[default mode network]] falls off precipitously, the [[ego]] temporarily vanishes. The [[psychedelic]] experience of “[[non-duality]]” suggests that consciousness survives the disappearance of the self, that it is not so indispensable as we—and it—like to think.
