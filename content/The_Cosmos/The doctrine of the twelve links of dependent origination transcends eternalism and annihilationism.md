## The doctrine of the twelve links of dependent origination transcends eternalism and annihilationism  #‚è≥ 

[[The twelve links of Dependent Origination]] are regarded as a "teaching by the middle" becuase it trandsends two radical views that polarize philosphical reflection on the human condition. These are [[eternalism]] and [[annihilationism]]. These extremes pose insuperable problems. [[Eternalism]] encourages obstanate [[clinging]] to [[the five aggregates]]. [[Annihilationism]] threatens to undermine ethics and to make suffering a product of chance. [[The twelve links of Dependent Origination]] thereby offer a cogent explanation of the problem of suffering that one hand avoids the philosophical dilemmas of a permanent self, and on the other hand avoids the dangers of ethical anarchy to which [[annihilationism]] eventually leads.
