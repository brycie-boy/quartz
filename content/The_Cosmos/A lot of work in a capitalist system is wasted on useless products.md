## A lot of work in a capitalist system is wasted on useless products  # 

Although it is true that [[people go without because the bourgeois will limit production in order to keep prices up]], this is only the direct and deliberate limitation of production. But there is also a indirect limitation that is not of a set purpose, which involves labour that is wasted on goods that are absolutely useless, or destined only to satisfy the dull vanity of the rich. What is squandered in this manner would be enough to double the production of useful things.
