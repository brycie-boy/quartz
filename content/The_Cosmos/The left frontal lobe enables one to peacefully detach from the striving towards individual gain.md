## The left frontal lobe enables one to peacefully detach from the striving towards individual gain # 

[[The frontal lobes for each hemisphere only negate the posterior regions rather than resist, enabling something new to arise]]. To take an example from the [[left hemisphere]]. The relative detachment from the body displayed by the [[left hemisphere]] ([[The right hemisphere sees the body as something we live, while the for the left it is devitalized]]), and its tendency to abstraction ([[The left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context]]), normally serve its purposeful striving towards individual gain. The left [[frontal lobe]], however, brings distance, and allows the experience of the peaceful detachment from the material realm and ‘emptying out’ described by experts in meditation as a [[mystical experience]]. Again this is no negation, but an elaboration, of what the [[left hemisphere]] affords. There is not likely to be ‘a God spot’ in the [[brain]], and the area is fraught with problems of terminology and methodology: but there are areas that are often implicated as accompaniments of religious experience.

An appropriately cautious and objective review of the literature to date by [[Michael Trimble]] concludes that there is a slow accumulation of evidence in favor of religious experience being more closely linked with the ‘non-dominant’ hemisphere, especially the posterior [[right hemisphere]] (temporoparietal region). But, to illustrate my point, the other region that is implicated lies in the left [[frontal lobe]]—specifically because of its power to inhibit the posterior [[left hemisphere]] (temporoparietal region), the seat of language and of sequential analysis.
