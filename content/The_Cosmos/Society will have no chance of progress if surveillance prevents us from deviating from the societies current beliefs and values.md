## Society will have no chance of progress if surveillance prevents us from deviating from the societies current beliefs and values #‚è≥

The fact that [[surveillence leads people to refrain from speaking and acting freely]] is especially damaging to social discourse. There is value in dissent. And, perversely, there can be value in lawbreaking, [[humanities greatest innovators are ones who defied social norms and followed their own intuitions]]. These are both ways that we improve as a society. Ubiquitous surveillance is the enemy of freedom and progress. 

If humanities old beliefs and values could have been imposed perfectly through mass surveillance, society would have never reached the point to where the majority of citizens thought those things were ok. There has to be a period where they are still forbidden yet increasingly tolerated, so that people can look around and say, "You know, that wasn't so bad." Yes, the process takes decades, but it's a process that can't happen without lawbreaking. Also, [[if a single set of views were to dominate society, the world would be static and dull]].

Freedoms we now take for granted were once considered to be treating or even criminal by previous power structures. Those changes might have never happened if authorities were able to achieve total social control through mass surveillance.
