## The overstimulation of dopamine receptors may lead to cell damage or death in the nucleus accumbens  # 

The [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]‚Äìharboring [[nucleus accumbens]] [[neuron]]s are fragile. They want to be tickled; that‚Äôs why they have [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s in the first place. But they‚Äôre very sensitive; they don‚Äôt want to be bludgeoned. If you open the [[dopamine]] floodgates repeatedly, these [[neuron]]s have some fail-safe methods built in to protect themselves. The goal is to have an optimal level of [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s so that even a minuscule [[dopamine]] rush can find an open [[receptor]] and generate a unique pleasure from the experience. Obviously, a bigger rush will occupy more [[receptor]]s and generate a bigger reward. But stimulating the [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s excites that next [[neuron]] in the [[nucleus accumbens]], and overstimulation with multiple rapid firings can cause those [[receptor]]-containing [[neuron]]s to go into overdrive, potentially leading to cell damage or death, termed [[excitotoxicity]].
