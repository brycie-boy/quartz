## Impermanence  # 

- alternative name: flux

Impermanence is one of [[the three characteristics]] and is generally attributed to [[the five aggregates]]. It refers to the quality of the world in which everything is in a constant state of flux. [[The Buddha]] describes the world as being "like a mountain river" that is "taking everything along with it; there is no moment, no instant, no second when it stops flowing, but it goes on flowing and continuing," and thus "The world is in continuous flux and is impermanent." It’s as if we live at the edge of a waterfall, with each moment rushing at us—experienced only and always now at the lip—and then zip, it’s over the edge and gone.
