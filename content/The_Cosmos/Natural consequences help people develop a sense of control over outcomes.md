## Natural consequences help people develop a sense of control over outcomes  # 

- [[Values can only be considered truly valid until one witnesses their value for themselves]]

Natural consequences help people to become more independent and self-assured. They help people to assume responsibility and to learn about how they can control outcomes through their own actions. After experiencing an unpleasant natural consequence, people can use the learned information the next time the situation occurs. Behavior may change once the child understands and experiences the unwanted outcome.
