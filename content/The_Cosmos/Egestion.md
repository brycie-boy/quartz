# 📤 Egestion

_“As above. So below.”_

Eventually my [[☀️ Main-Sequence Note]]s must leave [[🔮 The Cosmos]] and burst into the universe of others. Using my output as fertilizer, they too will create their own stars, and the [[time-binding]] cycle repeats. My output process aligns [[☯️ The Flow]]s goal of [[non-forcing]] in that, when compiling this work, [[the Flow can help prevent the cognitive burden of starting a writing project with a blank page]].
