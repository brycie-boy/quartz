## Operant conditioning  #🧠 

Operant [[conditioning]] is a type of associative learning process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment. Operant conditioning involves learning to approach stimuli because we have previously associated it with pleasant [[feeling]]s (reward) and learning avoid stimuli because we have previously associated it with painful [[feeling]]s (punishment). These approach and avoidance behaviors are known as positive and negative reinforcement.
