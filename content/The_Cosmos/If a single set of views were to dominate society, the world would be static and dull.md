## If a single set of views were to dominate society, the world would be static and dull  # 

[[Nothing can be fully understood without its opposite]], but arguments, division and tribalism are, of course, a source of discomfort and confusion. It is thus unsurprising that most people choose a side and want to see that side triumph. They long to enjoy the outbreak of peace that would‚Äîsupposedly‚Äîarrive after their chosen enemies had been wiped away. But a scenario like this would result in a static, unchanging world devoid of joy or surprise. [[Humanities greatest innovators are ones who defied social norms and followed their own intuitions]]. Without the momentum fueled by the clashing of perspectives, the universe would ground to a halt and die. Also, [[society will have no chance of progress if surveillance prevents us from deviating from the societies current beliefs and values]].
