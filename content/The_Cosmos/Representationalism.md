## Representationalism #🧠 

Representationalism is the philosophical position that our conscious experience is not of an objective world but of a subjective internal representation or mental simulation of the world shaped by [[predictive coding]]. Representationalists would deny that "first-hand knowledge" is a coherent concept, since knowledge is always via some means, and argue instead that our ideas of the world are interpretations of sensory input derived from an external world ([[Etic Reality]]) that is real (contra [[Idolatry]]).
