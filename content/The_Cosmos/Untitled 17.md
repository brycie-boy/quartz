## Heading  # 

Panpsychism is a type of [[eternalism]] which states that mind or [[consciousness]] is the fundamental ground of reality. Panpsychists posit that the type of mentality we know through our own experience is present, in some form, in a wide range of natural bodies. To pansychists, our brains simply act as a sort of receiver and refiner of this ubiquitous [[consciousness]].
