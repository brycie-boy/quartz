## Deductive reasoning  # 

Deductive [[reason]]ing is the mental process of drawing deductive [[inference]]s. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its [[premise]]s, i.e. it is impossible for the [[premise]]s to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises "all men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man" to the conclusion "Socrates is mortal." is deductively valid.
