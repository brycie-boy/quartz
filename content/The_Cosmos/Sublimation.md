## Sublimation  # 

Subplimation is a psychological process in which socially unacceptable impulses are transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior, possibly resulting in a long-term conversion of the initial impulse. [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that sublimation was a sign of maturity and civilization, allowing people to function normally in culturally acceptable ways.
