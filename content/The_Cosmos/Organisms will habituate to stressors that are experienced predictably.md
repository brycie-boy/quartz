## Organisms will habituate to stressors that are experienced predictably  # 

Not only does [[a lack of predictability as to when a stressor will occur has been shown to increase chronic stress]], organisms will eventually habituate to a [[stressor]] if it is applied over and over; it may knock physiological [[allostasis]] equally out of balance the umpteenth time that it happens, but it is a familiar, predictable [[stressor]] by then, and a smaller [[stress-response]] is triggered. One classic demonstration involved men in the Norwegian military going through parachute training‚Äîas the process went from being hair-raisingly novel to something they could do in their sleep, their anticipatory stress-response went from being gargantuan to nonexistent. I feel like this has to do with the fact that [[novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar]]. Once the [[left hemisphere]] feels like it has a grasp on the situation, it relaxes.
