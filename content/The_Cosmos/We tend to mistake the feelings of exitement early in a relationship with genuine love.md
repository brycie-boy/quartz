## We tend to mistake the feelings of exitement early in a relationship with genuine love  # 

Now let‚Äôs turn our attention to a set of emotions with which virtually everyone has some level of experience‚Äîa set of emotions that clearly parse the difference between the [[mesolimbic pathway]] (reward) and [[serotonergic pathway]] (contentment), and how conflation of the two can get you into some serious hot water. I offer you Exhibit B: love. ‚ÄúI love you, now let‚Äôs make love.‚Äù Two different statements, stemming from different biochemical reactions in the brain, with little in common except the word. Love is the harbinger and result of contentment ([[Serotonin]]); sex is driven by our need for reward ([[Dopamine]]). Amoeba engage in asexual reproduction. They don‚Äôt need a [[Limbic system]]. But mammals do, and they can‚Äôt do it alone. They not only need a partner, they get off on it. But this happens only under the influence of the male hormone testosterone. No [[testosterone]], no interest. And female rats arch their backs to attention (known as lordosis) to allow for copulation whenever their flanks are stroked, but only under the influence of the female hormone [[estrogen]]. It‚Äôs the same with humans, minus the lordosis. Think about it. Why in the world would post-pubescent young adults otherwise endure the pain of possible rejection, the idle chitchat, the overpriced bar bill, the smelly pheromones, and the bad breath, if there wasn‚Äôt a really top-notch reward at the end of it? There had better be a big payout. All because of testosterone and estrogen. Before sex hormones kick in at puberty, it‚Äôs all cooties. And then it‚Äôs all angst. Again, the biochemistry always comes first.

Love has been around for all of human history, hasn‚Äôt it? Maybe not¬†.¬†.¬†. as Tina Turner admonished us back in 1984, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs love but a secondhand emotion?‚Äù‚Äîsuggesting that it has hardly been a primary endpoint. One of the seminal problems parsing the pathways of love is yet another etymological problem. The Inuit have fifty-six names for snow, but we have only one. Similarly, the Greeks had three words for love, which relate more closely to the biochemistry than our one word. Eros is the intense infatuation you feel for your partner at the beginning of the relationship, often tied up in sexuality, and based on testosterone, estrogen, and suspension of reality. It‚Äôs a hot mix of increased dopamine in the reward pathway, but with a reduction of serotonin in the happiness pathway.

Using new imaging techniques like PET scanning, we can now peer into the [[brain]]s of people who are "in love" (infatuated). In this state, [[dopamine]] charges like a bull into the china shop of the [[prefrontal cortex]], that part of the [[brain]] that‚Äôs supposed to keep you on an even keel, so they become impulsive and aggressive. At the same time, [[serotonin]] levels fall, reducing any feelings of contentment that might modulate their angst. People suffering from infatuation exhibit anxiety, stress, and obtrusive thinking‚Äîthe emotions and the behaviors of obsessive-compulsive disorder, a psychiatric condition associated with low serotonin levels
