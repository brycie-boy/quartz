## A2 caseins have been shown to cause gastrointestinal inflammation  # 

Research suggests that [[A1 casein]]s may be harmful to the [[gut]] in ways that [[A2 casein]]s are not. In 2016, a team led by [[Sun Jianqin]] studied forty-five participants who consumed milk containing both A1 and A2 milk proteins, and then milk containing only [[A2 casein]]. The researchers found that when subjects drank milk containing [[A1 casein]], they had more gastrointestinal [[inflammation]], their thinking was slower, and they made more errors on an information-processing test. 

Luckily there is milk available that only has [[A2 casein]]. Milk from breeds of cows that originated in Northern Europe is generally high in [[A1 casein]]. These breeds include Holstein, Friesian, Ayrshire, and British shorthorn. Milk that is high in [[A2 casein]] is mainly found in breeds that originated in the Channel Islands and southern France. These include Guernsey, Jersey, Charolais, and Limousin cows. Sheep’s and goats’ milk is generally [[A2 casein]] milk. You can also try nut milks and milk nut yogurts as a way to avoid [[A2 casein]].
