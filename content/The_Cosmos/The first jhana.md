## The first jhana  #⏳ 

The first of [[the jhanas]] involves thought and examination and includes [[piti]] born from seclusion. I believe the it has to do with the fact that [[decreased default mode network activity may loosen the inhibitory mechanims in the brain]], allowing unconscious material to float to the surface of our awareness.
