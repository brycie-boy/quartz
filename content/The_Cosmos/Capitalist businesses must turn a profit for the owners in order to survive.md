## Capitalist businesses must turn a profit for the owners in order to survive  # 

In order for [[capitalism|capitalist]] institutions to survive they have to turn a profit for the [[bourgeoisie]] who own them, otherwise they'll be forced out of business by more ruthless competitors. This is carried out in two principle ways:

- [[Businesses seek to form monopolies so they can increase profits by maximizing prices]]
- [[Businesses seek to pay workers as little as possible increase profits]]
