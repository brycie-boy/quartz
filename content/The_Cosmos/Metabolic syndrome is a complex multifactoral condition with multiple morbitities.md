## Metabolic syndrome is a complex multifactoral condition with multiple morbitities  # 

Most of the targeted cures are not even remotely close to addressing the prolideration of deseise. This is because [[modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it]]. This scourge has no targeted cure despite what doctors may tell you, costing big dollars, and breaking healthcare in every country on the planet. Because today, for the chronic diseases that affect society the most, the cluster of NCDs folded in under the umbrella term [[metabolic syndrome]] (that as of 2021 cost 75 percent of healthcare dollars in the US and half of healthcare dollars around the world) are diseases that do not have one gene, or one pathway to target. These are multifactorial diseases with multiple morbidities.
