## Meaningless statement  #‚è≥

The proposition "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" fits the classical logical positivist category of a truly "meaningless" statement. That is because nobody can imagine a way of observing a colorless green idea, or even of its sleeping habits. 

However, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is as meaningless as a philosophical or scientific propostition. It is quite meaningful in another sense. Prof. [[Noam Chomsky]] used it to illustrate a technical point in linguistics, namely that we can recognize correct grammatical structure even when we cant extract a sensible message within the grammar.
