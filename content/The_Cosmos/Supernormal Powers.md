## Supernormal Powers  #

The Buddha refers to six types of supernormal knowledge he calls the “six types of direct knowledge” which are one of the lines of development that can be reached through [[The fourth jhana]]. These are:

- [[Remote viewing]]
- [[Telepathy]]
- [[Recollection of past lives]]
- the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings
- the knowledge of the distruction of [[The taints]]
