## Confirmation bias  #⏳

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's [[subjective bias]]es. It is do to the fact that [[our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]]. People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes.
