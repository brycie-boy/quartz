## Imprint  #üß† 

[[The brain selects for the brain circuits that are most utilized throughout development]], and imprints are more or less hard wired programs which the [[brain]] is genetically designed to except only at certain points in these stages of development. These points are known as times of imprint vulnerability. 

In general, the primordial imprint can always over-rule any subsequent [[conditioning]] or [[learning]]. An imprint is a species of [[the brains hardware and software|brain software]] that has become built in hardware, being impressed on tender [[neuron]]s when they are open and vulnerable. Imprints are non-negotiable aspects of our personality. Out of the infinity of possible programs existing as potential software, the imprint establishes the limits within which all subsequent [[conditioning]] occurs. Each successive imprint complicates the software which programs our experience and which we experience as "reality."  

Before the first imprint, the [[consciousness]] of the infant is ‚Äúformless and void‚Äù‚Äîlike the Universe at the beginning of Genesis, or the descriptions of unconditioned [[consciousness]] ([[Nibbana]]) in the [[Mysticism|mystic]] traditions. As soon as the first imprint is made, structure emerges out of the creative void. The growing mind, alas, becomes trapped within this structure. It identifies with the structure, and in a sense it becomes the structure. [[Conditioning]] and learning build further networks onto this bedrock of imprinted software. The total structure of this [[brain]]-circuitry makes up our map of the world. It is what our Thinker thinks, and our Prover mechanically fits all incoming signals to the limitations of this map ([[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]]).
