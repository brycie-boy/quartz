## The two elements of nibbana  #⏳ 

[[The Nikayas]] often speak of two "elements of [[Nibbana]]," the [[Nibbana]] element with residue remaining and the [[Nibbana]] element without residue remaining. The [[Nibbana]] element with residue remaining is described as the destruction of [[the three unwholesome roots]] while the [[Arahant]] is still alive. the "residue" is the composite of [[the five aggregates]] that was brought into being by the ignorance and craving from the previous life and that must continue on until the end of the lifespan. As for the [[Nibbana]] element without residue remaining, it is described as the passing away of the [[Arahant]] in which afterwords all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right there. Since there is no more clinging to [[the five aggregates]] and no more craving for a new existence with a fresh set of aggregates, the occurance of the aggregates comes to an end and cannot continue, the process of the aggregates is extinguished (the literal meaning of [[Nibbana]]).

[[The Buddha]], however, says nothing at all in terms of exitstence or nonexistence, the condition of the [[Arahant]] after death. It might seem logical that [[The five aggregates]] completely cease with the attainment of the [[Nibbana]] element without residue. The element itself must be a state of complete nonexistence, a state of nothingness. Yet no text within [[The Nikayas]] ever states this. To the contrary, they often refer to [[Nibbana]] in terms of actualities. It is an element, a base, a reality, a state, and so on. However,  it is qualified in ways that indicate this state ultimately lies beyond all familiar categories and concepts. In a discourse within [[The Nikayas]], the wanderer Vacchagotta asks [[The Buddha]] whether the [[Tathāgata]] is reborn or not after death. [[The Buddha]] refuses to concede any of the four alternatives. To say that the [[Tathāgata]] is reborn, is not reborn, both is and is not reborn, and neither is nor is not reborn—none of these is acceptable, for all accept the term [[Tathāgata]] as indicative of a real being, while from an internal point of view a [[Tathāgata]] has given up all [[clinging]] to notions of a real being. [[The Buddha]] illustrates this point with the simile of an extinguished fire. Just as a fire that has been extinguished cannot be said to have gone anywhere but must simply be said to have “gone out,” so too with the breakup of the body the [[Tathāgata]] does not go anywhere but has simply “gone out.” However, if this simile is interpreted as a Buddhist version of [[annihilationism]], then this impression would rest on a misunderstanding of the [[Arahant]] as a "self" or "person" that is annihilated (see [[identity view]]). Our problem with understanding the state of the [[Tathāgata]] after death is compounded by our difficulty understanding the state of the [[Tathāgata]] while alive. [[The Buddha]]s simile of the great ocean underscores this difficulty. Since the [[Tathāgata]] no longer identifies with [[the five aggregates]] that constitute individual identity, he cannot be reckoned in terms of them, individually or collectively. Freed from reckoning in terms of [[the five aggregates]], the [[Tathāgata]] transcends our understanding. Like a vast ocean, he is "deep, immesurable, and hard to fathom".
