## Reductionism # 

Reductionism is an attempt to explanation of entire systems in terms of their individual, constituent parts. Reductionism is said to imply that a system is nothing but the sum of its parts. I believe it to be the [[left hemisphere]]s way of understanding the world, because [[the right hemisphere sees the whole before the left hemisphere separates it into parts]].
