## A secure attachment in childhood is necessary for the development of the capacity to be alone  # 

If no disastrous severance of the bond between mother and infant occurs, the child developes a secure [[attachment]] and gradually becomes able to tolerate longer periods of maternal absence without anxiety. It is generally recognized that clinging behaviour is indicative of insecurity. The child who will not let the mother leave, even for short periods, is the child who has no confidence in her return. Conversely, the child who has developed trust in the availability of [[attachment]] figures is the child who can increasingly experience being left by such figures without anxiety. Thus, the capacity to be alone is one aspect of an inner security which has been built up over the early years. Building up a sense of security can be seen as a process of [[operant conditioning]]. Repeated confirmation of the presence of [[attachment]] figures when needed conditions the child to favourable expectations of their future availability. Although there are children who shun company and are pathologically isolated, that is, who are in the ‘withdrawn state’, a child who enjoys some measure of solitude should not be confused with such children. 

The capacity to be alone in adult life originates with the infant’s experience of being alone in the presence of the mother. It requires a state in which the infant’s immediate needs, for food, warmth, physical contact and so on, have been satisfied, so that there is no need for the infant to be looking to the mother for anything, nor any need for her to be concerned with providing anything. As the secure child grows, it will no longer need the constant physical presence of a [[attachment]] figure, but will be able to be alone without anxiety for longer periods.
