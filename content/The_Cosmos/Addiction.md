## Addiction  # 

Addiction is any repeated behavior, substance-related or not, in which a person feels compelled to persist, regardless of its negative impact on their life and the lives of others. Addiction involves:

- compulsive engagement with the behavior, a preoccupation with it
- impaired control over the behavior
- persistence or relapse despite evidence of harm
- dissatisfaction, irritability, or intense [[craving]] when the object—be it a drug, activity, or other goal—is not immediately available.
- Compulsion, impaired control, persistence, irritability, relapse, and [[craving]]
