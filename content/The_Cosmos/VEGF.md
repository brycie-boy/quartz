## VEGF  # 

VEGF is a [[hormone]] which helps with building more [[Capillary|capillaries]] in the [[body]] and the [[brain]] when our body’s [[cell]]s run short of [[oxygen]], as they can when our muscles contract during exercise.

Researchers suspect that one way VEGF is vital to [[neurogenesis]] is its role in changing the permeability of the [[blood-brain barrier]], prying back the fence to let other factors through during exercise.
