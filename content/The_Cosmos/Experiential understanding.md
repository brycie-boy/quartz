## Experiential understanding #‚è≥ 

Experiential understanding refers to the intuitive understanding of a concept through direct penetration of a it within ones immediate experience. To achieve direct penetration, one begins with correct [[conceptual understanding]] ([[Direct Insight cannot occur without having a conceptual framework to facilitate it]]), and by practice, transforms this understanding into direct penetration. 

Neurologically, It involves the [[right hemisphere]], as [[the global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]], making it more in touch with embodied experience. Also, [[the right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities]]. Through experiential understanding, we go from an abstract and fragmentary understanding to understanding each of those parts wholistically and intuitively, all at once.
