## When we mistake our models with reality itself, we stifle our capacity to learn new ideas #üß† 

As Persinger and Lafreniere write in Space Time Transients and Unusual Events: "We, as a species, exist in a world in which exist a myriad of data points. Upon these matrices of points we superimpose a structure and the world makes sense to us. The pattern of the structure originates within our biological and sociological properties." To the extent that we remain conscious of this process of superimposing structure (programming our [[emic reality]]), then we will behave liberally and will continue learning through our lives. To the extent that we become unconscious of this, we will behave [[Fundamentalism|Fundamentalistically]] and [[idolatry|Idolatrously]] and will never again learn anything after we elevate a generalization into dogma and stop thinking. 

If we become fully hypnotized by a [[reality tunnel]], we may even become, in conventional terms, a bit mad. In such a state of mania, we might censor information that contains heresy against our [[idol]]s, or fake data to support our prejudices, or find ourselves compelled to explain increasing amounts of discordant data by accusing vast amorphous conspiracies of having "cooked the data." Or we may even become sincerely convinced that any one who senses anything inconsistent with out [[idol]] must be hallucinating. In such a state, we appear "beyond reasoning," i. e. beyond the normal parameters of social discourse.
