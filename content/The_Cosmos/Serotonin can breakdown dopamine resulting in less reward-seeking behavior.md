## Serotonin can breakdown dopamine resulting in less reward-seeking behavior  # 

The [[serotonergic pathway]] has the capacity to tame (or excite) the [[Mesolimbic pathway]]. Animal data has shown that the contentment from [[serotonin]] can reverse addictive behavior. [[Serotonin]] can speed up the breakdown and disposal of [[dopamine]], resulting in decreased [[dopamine]]-related reward signaling and reward-seeking behavior. In humans, we know that high levels of serotonin can decrease alcohol intake (although your antidepressants can‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre imbibing three bottles a day). Conversely, [[serotonin]] depletion (through experimental depletion of [[tryptophan]]) is associated with risky choice making.1Serotonin agonists such as [[LSD]] and [[psilocybin]] are being used as potential treatments for smoking, alcohol, and other drug addictions.
