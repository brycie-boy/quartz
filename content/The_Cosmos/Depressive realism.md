## Depressive realism  # 

[[Depression|Depressive]] realism is the hypothesis developed by [[Lauren Allow]] and [[Lyn Yvonne Adramson]] that [[Depression|depressed]] individuals in some cases make more realistic inferences than non-[[Depression|depressed]] individuals. Although [[Depression|depressed]] individuals are thought to always have a negative [[cognitive distortion]], [[Depression|depressive]] realism argues not only that this negativity may reflect a more accurate appraisal of the world but also that non-[[Depression|depressed]] individuals' appraisals are positively biased. 

The fact that [[the right frontal lobe has a depressive stance, where as the left shows undue cheerfulness]] is supportive of this idea. Especially considering that [[the right hemisphere deals with real things that have meaning to us in the lived world]], while [[The left hemisphere deals with non-realistic and artificial images]]. Also, [[the right hemisphere is more realistic but also more pessimistic and favors depression]]. Perhaps [[Depression|depressive]] realism is [[right hemisphere]] [[depression]], since [[the right hemisphere brings anxious, disturbed depression while the left brings indifferent or apathetic depression]].
