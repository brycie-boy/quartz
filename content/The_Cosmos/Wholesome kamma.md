## Wholesome kamma #‚è≥ 

Wholesome [[kamma]] is an action that is beneficial to the agent, morally commendable, and brings pleasant fruits. It is [[kamma]] that ripens into good fortune and happiness, or a "heavenly experience". The criterion for judging [[kamma]] as wholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots"; these are [[the three wholesome roots]]. Wholesome kamma may be characterized as being in harmonony in the others, and thus is inline with [[non-forcing]].
