## If suffering is avoidable, we should strive to remove it rather than endure it # 

[[We can find meaning in uncontrollable suffering by taking it as a challenge to triumph and change our attitudes]], but it must be made loud and clear that in no way is suffering necessary to find meaning. It is to insist that meaning is possible even in spite of suffering‚Äîprovided that the suffering is unavoidable. If it were avoidable, however, the meaningful thing to do would be to remove its cause, be it psychological, biological or political. To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.
