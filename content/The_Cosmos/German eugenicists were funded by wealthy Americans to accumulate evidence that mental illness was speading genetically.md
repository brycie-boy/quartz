## German eugenicists were funded by wealthy Americans to accumulate evidence that mental illness was speading genetically # 

In the U.S., [[The eugenics movement had established the paradigm that mental illness was genetically inherited]], and much as U.S. [[genetics|geneticists]] had, German [[Eugenics|eugenicists]] sought to develop scientific evidence that mental illnesses were inherited and that such [[gene]]tic disease was spreading through its population. American money helped fund this effort. In 1925, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] gave $2.5 million to the Psychiatric Institute in Munich, which quickly became Germany’s leading center for [[eugenics]] research. In addition, it gave money to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human [[Gene]]tics and [[Eugenics]] in Berlin, which was used to pay for a national survey of “degenerative traits” in the German population.
