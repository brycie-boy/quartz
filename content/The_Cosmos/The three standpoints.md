## The three standpoints  #⏳ 

[[We ordinarily perceive reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]], so help us transform our understanding and deepen our perspective on the world, [[the Buddha]] offeres three standpoints from which we can appraise the values by which we order our lives. These three standpoints can also represent three moments or steps in an unfolding process of [[insight]] that starts from our common sense attitudes and moves toward higher wisdom, enlightenment, and [[Nibbana]]. These three moments are: 

- gratification
- danger
- escape

Gratification involves the pleasure and joy we experience when we succeed in accomplishing our goals. If we take an deeper look, however, from a dispassionate frame of mind, we can see that such pleasure and joy is far from satisfactory, to the contrary, it holds various drawbacks, or dangers. The most prominent of dangers being the fact that such pleasures are impermanent, unsatisfying, and subject to change or decay. “Escape” here is not escapism, a word that implies an anxious attempt to avoid facing one’s problems by pretending they don’t exist and losing oneself in distractions. True escape is quite the oppisite: Once we see that our goals and values are flawed and beset with hidden dangers, we realize that the way to escape lies in removing our attachment to them.
