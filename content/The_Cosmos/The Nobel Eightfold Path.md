## The Nobel Eightfold Path #‚è≥ 

The Nobel Eight Fold Path is a classical formulation of the way toward the realization of [[Nibbana]]. As is already made clear from [[the Buddha]]'s first sermon where he calls the Nobel Eight Fold Path the way leading to the cessation of suffering. The eight factors of the path are commonly distributed into three groups as follows:

- The moral disipline group, consisting of:

   - [[Right Speech]]
   - [[Right Action]]
   - [[Right Livelihood]]

- The concentration group, consisting of:

   - [[Right Effort]]
   - Right Mindfullness which involves [[The establishments of mindfulness]]
   - Right Concentration which is involves [[the jhanas]]

- The wisdom group, consisting of:

   - Right View, which refers to the knowledge of [[the four nobel truths]]
   - [[Right Intention]]
