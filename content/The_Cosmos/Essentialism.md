## Essentialism  #🧠 

Essentialism is the view that objects have a inherent set of attributes that are necessary to their identity. [[Plato]] held that all things have an "essence"—an "idea" or "form." [[Aristotle]] similarly proposed that all objects have a substance that "make the thing what it is, and without which it would not be _that_ kind of thing." Essentialism may be a product of [[reification]].
