## Non-returning  #

Non-returning is the third stage of [[the four stages of awakening]]. The non-returner eradicates the five "lower fetters". That is, in addition to the first three fetters eliminated by [[stream-entry]], the non-returner eradicates two additional fetters, sensual lust and ill will. The non-returner is still bound by the five "higher fetters": desire for existence in [[the form realm]], desire for existence in [[the formless realm]], the conceit "i am", restlessness, and [[ignorance]]. Becuase non-returners have eradicated sensual lust, they have no ties binding them to the [[The sense-sphere realm]]. Thus, they take birth in [[The form realm]], generally in one of the five planes called the "pure abodes" exclusivley reserved for non-returners. They attain final [[Nibbana]] there without ever returning to the sensual realm.
