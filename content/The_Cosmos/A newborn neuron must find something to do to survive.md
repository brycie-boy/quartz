## A newborn neuron must find something to do to survive  # 

[[Neuron]]s are born as blank-slate [[stem cell]]s, and they go through a development process in which they need to find something to do in order to survive. Most of them don’t. It takes about twenty-eight days for a fledgling [[neuron]] to plug into a network. in order for a [[neuron]] to survive and integrate, it has to fire its [[axon]]. If we don’t use the newborn [[neuron]]s, we lose them.
