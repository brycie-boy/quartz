## Insulin can be both good and bad for you  # 

[[Insulin]] is good for you in that it lowers [[blood glucose]] to prevent microvascular disease‚Äîbut is also bad for you in that it increases the [[smooth muscle]] around the [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]] or in the [[kidney]], leading to narrowing, and more risk for a [[heart attack]] or [[kidney]] failure. [[Insulin]] has two actions in [[cell]]s: 1) metabolic (lowers glucose, stores energy); and 2) cell proliferation (meaning growth and division). Every insulin molecule your pancreas makes is both good and bad for you, all at the same time‚Äîshort-term gain (blood-glucose lowering) for long-term pain (vascular dysfunction and cancer).

This dichotomous effect of [[insulin]] has been seen in every intensive [[blood glucose]] control study, such as the UK Prospective [[Diabetes]] Study (UKPDS), the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in [[Diabetes]] Study (ACCORD) on the effects of rosiglitazone, the Veterans Affairs [[Diabetes]] Trial (VADT), and the Action in [[Diabetes]] and Vascular Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), which actually had to be stopped midstream because of the increase in patient mortality from large vessel disease ([[heart disease]]). We need [[insulin]] to survive, but if we are [[Insulin resistance|insulin resistant]], adding extra [[insulin]] lowers [[glucose]] only at the expense of contributing to chronic disease. Short-term gain for long-term pain.
