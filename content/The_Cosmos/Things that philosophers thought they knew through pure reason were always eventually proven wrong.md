## Things that philosophers thought they knew through pure reason were always eventually proven wrong # 

[[Because perception is not absolute, our models of reality are all somewhat conjectural and inferential]]. However, despite [[the water bowls experiment]], the Greek philosophers, or some of them, still regarded [[pure reason]] was a path to certitude. This has collapsed over the centuries for a variety of reasons, but chiefly because the things philosophers thought they knew this way have often turned out to be simply not true. For instance, even as late as the age of libertarian free thought in the 18th Century, Kant still thought pure reason "knew" intuitively that [[Euclidean geometry]] was the true and only geometry. Nowadays, mathematicians have several varieties of non-[[Euclidean geometry]], all of which are equally valid (consistent) and all of which are as useful as [[[Euclidean geometry]], although in different areas.
