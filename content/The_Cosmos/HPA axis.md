## HPA axis #🧠 

The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis for short) is a complex set of direct influences and feedback interactions among three components: the [[hypothalamus]], the [[pituitary gland]], and the [[adrenal gland]]s. The HPA axis is a major [[neuroendocrine system]] that controls reactions to stress and regulates many other body processes. The HPA axis acts like the childhood game of telephone. FIrst, the [[amygdala]] tells the [[hypothalamus]], which tells the [[pituitary]], which tells the [[adrenal glands]] to release [[cortisol]].
