## The American Eugenics Society put up displays and organized contests at fairs to promote eugenics to the general public # 

[[After the 1921 Second International Congress on Eugenics, many prominent eugenicists joined to form a U.S. national eugenics society to promote eugenics to the public]]. State fairs proved to be particularly good forums for educating the public. In addition to its flashing-light exhibit, the society set up charts explaining the laws of [[Mendelian inheritance]] and how they determined human types. “Unfit human traits,” the American [[Eugenics]] Society advised the American public, “run in families and are inherited in exactly the same way as color in guinea pigs.” To further its point, the American [[Eugenics]] Society organized “Fitter Families” contests, with entrants submitting family histories, undergoing psychiatric exams, and taking IQ tests, all in the hope that they would be deemed Grade-A humans. Winning families joined other best-of-show livestock—pigs, goats, cows—in end-of-fair parades, the humans riding in automobiles decorated with banners proclaiming them the state’s “best crop.”
