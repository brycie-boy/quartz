## The evolution of the human brain lead to our brains being immature at birth  # 

Of all the mammals, we humans have the least mature [[brain]] at birth. Early in their infancy other newborn animals perform tasks far beyond the capabilities of human babies. A horse, for example, can run on its first day of life. Not for a year and a half or more can most humans muster the muscle strength, visual acuity, and neurological control skills‚Äîperception, balance, orientation in space, coordination‚Äîto perform that activity. In other words, the horse‚Äôs [[brain]] development at birth is at least a year and a half ahead of our own‚Äîprobably even more, in horse years. Why are we saddled with such a disadvantage in comparison to a horse? We can think of it as a compromise imposed by Nature. Our evolutionary predecessors were permitted to walk upright, which freed fore-limbs to evolve into arms and hands capable of many delicate and complicated activities. Those advances in manual versatility and dexterity required a tremendous enlargement of the [[brain]], especially of its frontal areas. Our [[frontal lobe]]s, which coordinate the movement of our hands, are much larger even than those of our closest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. These lobes, particularly the [[prefrontal cortex]], are also responsible for the problem solving, social, and language skills that have allowed humankind to thrive. As we became a two-legged species, the human pelvis had to narrow to accommodate our upright stance. At the end of the nine months of human gestation the head forms the largest diameter of the body, the one most likely to get stuck in our journey through the birth canal. It‚Äôs simple engineering: any further [[brain]] growth in the [[uterus]] and we couldn‚Äôt be born.
