## Mindfulness #‚è≥ 

Mindfulness is a sustained non-judgmental recollection of the present and what is happening to us and within us throughout moment to moment experience. Mindfulness allows us to stabilize attention and dwell in a lucid space of non-reactive awareness. This helps keep the mind from slipping into [[habit]]s and mindwandering through forgetfulness and mental proliferation. Mindfulness can culminate into the experience of [[flow]]. [[Serenity]] and [[Insight]] are both elements of mindfulness.
