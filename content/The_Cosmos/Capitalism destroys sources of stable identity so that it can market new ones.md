## Capitalism destroys sources of stable identity so that it can market new ones  # 

[[Capitalism]] needs to create an ever-growing number of micro-identities for people to fit themselves into, so that those identities could be commodified and marketed to. [[Capitalism]] decodes and deterritorializes codes, rules and social desires, scrambling the code of human behavior and the human mind so that it can artificially reterritorialize these necessities with its own rules, codes and desires. [[Capitalism]] then must give us things to make sense of the world because [[capitalism]] has taken all our inherent internalized senses of self and community away. In our modern era, this deterritorializing and reterritorializing happens at a rapid pace: we are asked to identify and deidentify within hours, minutes, or seconds.
