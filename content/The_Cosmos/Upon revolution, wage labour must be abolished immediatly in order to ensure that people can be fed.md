## Upon revolution, wage labour must be abolished immediatly in order to ensure that people can be fed # 

The coming revolution could render no greater service to humanity than by making [[wage labour]], in all its forms, an impossibility, and by rendering [[communism]], which is the negation of [[wage-slavery]], the only possible solution. For even admitting that the collectivist modification of the present system is possible, it would become impossible in a period of revolution, when the need of feeding the hungry would the first concern. A political revolution can be accomplished without shaking the foundations of industry, but a revolution where the people sieze [[private property]] will inevitably paralyse exchange and production. The millions of public money flowing into the Treasury would not suffice for paying wages to the millions of out-of-works.

This point cannot be stressed enough; the reorganization of industry on a new basis cannot be accomplished in a few days; nor, on the other hand, will the people submit to being half starved for years in order to oblige to the theorists who uphold the [[wage labour]] system. To tide over the period of stress they will demand what they have always demanded in such cases‚Äî[[Communism|communization]] of supplies and the giving of rations. It will be in vain to preach patience. The people will be patient no longer.
