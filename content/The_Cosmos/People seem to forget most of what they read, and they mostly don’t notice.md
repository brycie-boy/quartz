## People seem to forget most of what they read, and they mostly don‚Äôt notice  # 

It seems that most people can remember only a few high-level details of a book weeks later‚Äîif that. A typical reader might spend hours finishing some serious non-fiction‚Äîthen maybe it comes up at a dinner party, and they find you can remember like three sentences. Basically no detailed recall. Barely the gist! What‚Äôs more: people seem surprised when this happens. They seem to consistently overestimate how much they‚Äôre absorbing from a book. Perhaps this is because of the [[Dunning-Kruger effect]].
