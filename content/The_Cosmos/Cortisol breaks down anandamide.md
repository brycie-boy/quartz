## Cortisol breaks down anandamide  # 

The more [[cortisol]] in the body, the more breakdown of the [[endocannabinoid]] [[CB1 receptor]] agonist and anti-anxiety compound [[anandamide]], and the more anxiety. This is where [[cannabis]] comes in—to curb the anxiety of everyday living. Like other drugs, [[cannabis]] acts on a specific part of the [[brain]] and, depending on whether you are a person who gets paranoid from a few tokes, it can, like, seriously, help you to mellow out. However, chronic marijuana users show long-term cognitive decline to the tune of 8 IQ points, so, in the end, they may be less stressed about reality anyway.
