## Use notes to avoid preconceived conclusions  # 

When working on a writing projects, people generally begin with a conclusion or angle already in mind, and then [[what the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]]. If we’re not careful, those preconceptions will distort our thinking. But if we begin by writing atomic [[☀️ Main-Sequence Note]]s, we can let the conclusions and topic _emerge_ from our careful thinking.
