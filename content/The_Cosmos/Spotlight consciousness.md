## Spotlight consciousness  # 

Spotlight [[consciousness]] is a [[low-entropy state]] that gives people the ability to narrowly focus attention on a goal. It is the domain of the [[left hemisphere]], as [[the right hemisphere has broad, global attention, while the left has narrow attention]]. The [[left hemisphere]] directs the spotlight of its attention where it will and then relies on [[predictive coding]] to interpret what it perceives. This is the default conscious state of adults, as children experience more of [[lantern consciousness]].
