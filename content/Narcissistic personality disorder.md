## Narcissistic personality disorder  # 

Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a [[personality disorder]] that is characterized by: 

- a grandiose sense of self-importance
- fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love;
- a belief in being “special” and unique and can only be understood by, or should be associated with, other special or high-status people
- an excessive need for admiration and validation
- a sense of entitlement
- Interpersonally exploitation
- a lack empathy and is unwilling to identify with the needs of others
- envy of the success of others
- arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes

Seen from [[operant conditioning]] perspective, narcissism can be linked to parenting styles in which praise exceeds what is warranted (“Everyone gets a trophy, especially you!”) and corrective punishment is nonexistent (“My child is on their own journey”). Trigger (seeing aquantance), behavior (success update), reward (being congratulated). The child develops a need for praise that cannot easily be sated. Instead of spirits, they need ongoing positive reinforcement: “Like me, tell me I’m great, do it again.”
