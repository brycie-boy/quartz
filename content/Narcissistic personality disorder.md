## Narcissistic personality disorder

Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a [personality disorder]() that is characterized by: 

* goal setting based on gaining approval from others
* excessive attunement to others’ reactions (but only if they are perceived as relevant to self)
* excessive attempts to be the focus of attention, and admiration seeking

Seen from [operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md) perspective, narcissism can be linked to parenting styles in which praise exceeds what is warranted (“Everyone gets a trophy, especially you!”) and corrective punishment is nonexistent (“My child is on her own journey”). Trigger (seeing aquantance), behavior (success update), reward (being congratulated). The child develops a need for praise that cannot easily be sated. Instead of spirits, they need ongoing positive reinforcement: “Like me, tell me I’m great, do it again.”
