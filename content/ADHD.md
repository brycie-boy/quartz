* I think that the lack of motivation has less to do with a chemical imbalance, and more to do with the fact that [Neurons reduce receptor quantity when overstimulated](Neurons%20reduce%20receptor%20quantity%20when%20overstimulated.md) and [There must be a balanced amount of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway to prevent lethargy or irritablility](There%20must%20be%20a%20balanced%20amount%20of%20dopamine%20in%20the%20mesolimbic%20pathway%20to%20prevent%20lethargy%20or%20irritablility.md). Over active stress response and poor inhibition leads to excessive indulgence in shorterm relief which drives down dopamine receptors over time

Attention deficit hyper activity disorder (ADHD) is a [mental disorder]() characterized by trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors, or be overly active. ADHD symptoms arise from [executive dysfunction](Executive%20functions.md). The brain structure primarily implicated in ADHD [orbitofrontal cortex](Orbitofrontal%20cortex.md). ADHD patients also show reduced volume in the [cerebellum](Cerebellum.md), which can cause disjointed attention.
