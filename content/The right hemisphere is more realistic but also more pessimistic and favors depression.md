## The right hemisphere is more realistic but also more pessimistic and favors depression # 

[[The right hemisphere is more self-aware and realistic, while the left is more grandiose, optimistic, and unrealistic about it's shortcomings]]. Also, although relatively speaking the [[right hemisphere]] takes a more pessimistic view of the self, it is also more realistic about it. There is evidence that (a) those who are somewhat [[Depression|depressed]] are more realistic, including in self-evaluation; and that (b) [[depression]] is (often) a condition of relative hemisphere asymmetry, favoring the [[right hemisphere]]. I believe this may be what is behind [[depressive realism]]. Even [[schizophrenia|schizophrenics]] have more insight into their condition in proportion to the degree that they have [[Depression|depressive]] symptoms. The evidence is that this is not because insight makes you [[Depression|depressed]], but because being [[Depression|depressed]] gives you insight.
