## The right hemisphere is more realistic but also more pessimistic and favors depression

[The right hemisphere is more self-aware and realistic, while the left is more grandiose, optimistic, and unrealistic about it's shortcomings](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20more%20self-aware%20and%20realistic,%20while%20the%20left%20is%20more%20grandiose,%20optimistic,%20and%20unrealistic%20about%20it's%20shortcomings.md). Also, although relatively speaking the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) takes a more pessimistic view of the self, it is also more realistic about it. There is evidence that (a) those who are somewhat [depressed](Depression.md) are more realistic, including in self-evaluation; and that (b) [depression](Depression.md) is (often) a condition of relative hemisphere asymmetry, favoring the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md). I believe this may be what is behind [depressive realism](Depressive%20realism.md). Even [schizophrenics]() have more insight into their condition in proportion to the degree that they have [depressive](Depression.md) symptoms. The evidence is that this is not because insight makes you [depressed](Depression.md), but because being [depressed](Depression.md) gives you insight.
