## Goldilocks Rule

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. One of the most consistent findings in science is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.” The human [brain](Brain.md) loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. Your focus narrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand. Once a [habit](Habit.md) has been established, it’s important to continue to advance in small ways. These little improvements and new challenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve [flow](Flow.md).
