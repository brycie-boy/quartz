## The revolution must handle food before any other issue

What the revolution needs first and formost is food. Let others spend their time in issuing pompous proclamations, or in decorating themselves, and in talking about political liberty. We must ensure that there is not a single person who lacks food. It has always been the middle-class idea to blabber about "great principles" and what not. The idea of the people will be to provide food for all. And while middle-class citizens, and workmen infested with middle-class ideas admire their own rhetoric, and "practical people" are engaged in endless discussions on forms of government, we will consider food. Food must be found for the people of the revolution, and the question of food must take precedence over all other questions. If it is settled in the interests of the people, the revolution will be on the right road.
