## The left hemisphere is prone to over-optimistic denial

[Those with damage to the right hemisphere lack insight into illness or even denial of it](Those%20with%20damage%20to%20the%20right%20hemisphere%20lack%20insight%20into%20illness%20or%20even%20denial%20of%20it.md), and [those with right hemisphere legions show a dull unrelenting cheerfulness in the face of incapacity](Those%20with%20right%20hemisphere%20legions%20show%20a%20dull%20unrelenting%20cheerfulness%20in%20the%20face%20of%20incapacity.md). Denial is a [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) specialty: in states of relative [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) inactivation, in which there is therefore a bias toward the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), subjects tend to evaluate themselves optimistically, view pictures more positively, and are more apt to stick to their existing point of view. In the presence of a [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) stroke, the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is ‚Äòcrippled by naively optimistic forecasting of outcomes‚Äô. It is always a winner: winning is associated with activation of the left [amygdala](Amygdala.md), losing with right [amygdala](Amygdala.md) activation.
