## Cortisol release promotes the consumption of high-energy dense food # 

- Both animals and humans increase their food intake when stressed or when experiencing negative emotions, regardless of whether or not they are hungry. And there’s actually a reason for this. High-energy dense food, aka comfort food increases acute energy to the brain and thus reduces the amygdala’s output and subsequent stress.
- Stress may affect food intake in several ways. For instance, people with eating disorders tend to show higher levels of cortisol or greater cortisol reactivity.

- Cortisol is an appetite stimulant; infusion of cortisol into humans rapidly increases food intake. Those who put out more cortisol in response to chronic stress also usually consume the most comfort food in response to stress.
- worse. Cortisol actually kills neurons that help to inhibit food intake.
