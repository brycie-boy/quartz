## Communal narcissism # 

Communal [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissism]] involves an effort to gain favorable appraisals from others in the absence of a genuine communal self-view. This means that someone who is a communal narcissist feels good about themself exclusively by how they imagine they are perceived for their contributions to others.

Communal narcissism is defined by the same sense of entitlement and grandiosity that we are familiar with as traditional narcissism. The main difference is that a communal narcissist moves outside their own self to validate their worth. The end result of those actions is that it allows the communal narcissist to be viewed as someone who actually is working to help other people and receive the praise associated with this. This means that someone who is a communal narcissist is primarily concerned with being seen as altruistic and benevolent, even if this is not the case.

Unlike people with good, charitable intentions, a communal narcissist is a person who is only behaving well and helping others for the sake of receiving praise for their actions or being perceived as morally superior. Communal narcissists may require this praise from their community because they do not believe in their own worth themselves, and need to get that. This is tricky because even if a communal narcissist is behaving in a way that appears to be valiant, their motivation is not to be helpful or kind. Rather, it's to be perceived as acting helpful or kind.
