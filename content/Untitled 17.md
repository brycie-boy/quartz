## Heading # 

- Attention is not just another ‘function’ alongside other cognitive functions. Its ontological status is of something prior to functions and even to things.
- Attention changes what kind of a thing that comes into being for us. 
- yet nothing has changed objectively. The [[etic reality]] remains the same. This is the case with everything which we come into contact with. 
- There is no "real" interpretation which can be distinguished from these, no one way of thinking which reveals the true energy-event. It begins to seem that no one [[reality tunnel]] is adequate for the description of all human experience, although some [[reality tunnel]]s are better in some contexts than others are. 
- Science, however, purports to be uncovering the "real" event. Its apparently “objective” value-free descriptions are assumed to deliver the truth about the energy-event, onto which our feelings and desires are later painted. Yet this highly objective stance is itself value-laden. It is just one particular way of looking at things, a way which privileges detachment and a lack of emotional commitment of the viewer to the object viewed. For some purposes this can be undeniably useful. But its use in such cases does not make it truer or more “real,” or closer to the true nature of things.
- Attention is inescapably bound up with value—unlike what we conceive as ‘cognitive functions’, which are neutral in this respect. Values enter through the way in which those functions are exercised: they can be used in different ways for different purposes to different ends. Attention, however, intrinsically is a way in which, not a thing: it is intrinsically a relationship, not a brute fact. It is a ‘howness’, a something between, an aspect of consciousness itself, not a ‘whatness’, a thing in itself, an object of consciousness. It brings into being a world and, with it, depending on its nature, a set of values.
- If what it is that exists comes into being for each one of us through its interaction with our [[brain]]s and minds, then the idea that we could have an objective knowledge of it that was not also an expression of ourselves, and dependent on what we brought to the relationship, is untenable.
- Different aspects of the world come into being on the nature of our attention
