## The results of an action can disincentivize us to perform that action in the future

There may be plenty of punishment in simply seeing the results of our actions: if they cause harm and we see that they do, we will be less excited to repeat them in the future. We would become disenchanted with harmful actions. [Natural consequences allow people to make associations between actions and their inherent consequences](Natural%20consequences%20allow%20people%20to%20make%20associations%20between%20actions%20and%20their%20inherent%20consequences.md). But it is critical that we actually and accurately see what is happening. [Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) can be very helpful in this regard. We must remove our glasses of [subjective bias](Subjective%20bias.md), which skew how we interpret what is happening, so that we can clearly see everything that results from our behavior. Unless we get that immediate feedback‚Äîseeing the consequences of our actions‚Äîwe may learn something else entirely.
