## Psychedelics and mindfulness let in extra sensory signals by silencing the default mode network  # 

Because of how [[decreased default mode network activity may loosen the inhibitory mechanims in the brain]], It seems plausable to assume that [[psychedelic]]s and [[mindfulness]] silence the processes in which [[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]], thus activating areas of the [[brain]] that are that are [[habit]]ually deactivated by the [[default mode network]]. The subject is then percieving maybe 20 to 100 sensory signals per minute instead of the usual 10. This is enough to produce histarical laughter, profound awe, or accute anxiety.
