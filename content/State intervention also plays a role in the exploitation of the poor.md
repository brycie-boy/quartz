## State intervention also plays a role in the exploitation of the poor

People whos interests are not diametrically opposed tend to agree without the intervention of authority, but we do not ignore the objections that will be put forth. All such examples have their defective side, because it is impossible to quote a single organization exempt from the exploitation of the weak by the strong, the poor by the rich. This is why the statists will not fail to tell us with their wonted logic: ‚ÄòYou see that the intervention of the state is necessary to put an end to this exploitation!‚Äô Only they forget the lessons of history; they do not tell us to what extent the state itself has contributed towards the existing order by creating [proletarians](Proletariat.md) and delivering them up to exploiters. They forget to prove to us that it is possible to put an end to exploitation while the primal causes ‚Äì [private property](Private%20property.md) and poverty ([the wealth of the rich is derived from the poverty of the poor](The%20wealth%20of%20the%20rich%20is%20derived%20from%20the%20poverty%20of%20the%20poor.md)), two-thirds of which are artificially created by the [state]() ‚Äì continue to exist. As long as there are capitalists, these abuses of power will be perpetuated. It is precisely the [state](), the would-be benefactor, that has given to the companies that monopoly and those rights upon us which they possess today.
