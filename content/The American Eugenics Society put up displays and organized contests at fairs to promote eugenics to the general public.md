## The American Eugenics Society put up displays and organized contests at fairs to promote eugenics to the general public

[After the 1921 Second International Congress on Eugenics, many prominent eugenicists joined to form a U.S. national eugenics society to promote eugenics to the public](After%20the%201921%20Second%20International%20Congress%20on%20Eugenics,%20many%20prominent%20eugenicists%20joined%20to%20form%20a%20U.S.%20national%20eugenics%20society%20to%20promote%20eugenics%20to%20the%20public.md). State fairs proved to be particularly good forums for educating the public. In addition to its flashing-light exhibit, the society set up charts explaining the laws of [Mendelian inheritance](Mendelian%20inheritance.md) and how they determined human types. “Unfit human traits,” the American [Eugenics](Eugenics.md) Society advised the American public, “run in families and are inherited in exactly the same way as color in guinea pigs.” To further its point, the American [Eugenics](Eugenics.md) Society organized “Fitter Families” contests, with entrants submitting family histories, undergoing psychiatric exams, and taking IQ tests, all in the hope that they would be deemed Grade-A humans. Winning families joined other best-of-show livestock—pigs, goats, cows—in end-of-fair parades, the humans riding in automobiles decorated with banners proclaiming them the state’s “best crop.”
