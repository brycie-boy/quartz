## We may attract any force by making ourselves a fit condition for its manifestation # 

[[Each thing is interlinked to the rest of the Universe in various ways we do not yet know]], and [[since any force can be transformed into any other, we have an inexhaustible supply of any force we may need]]. Thus a person may attract to themselves any force of the Universe by making themselves a fit receptacle for it, establishing a connection with it, and arranging conditions so that its nature compels it to flow toward him. If I want pure water to drink, I dig a well in a place where there is underground water; I prevent it from leaking away; and I arrange to take advantage of water's accordance with the laws of Hydrostatics to fill it.
