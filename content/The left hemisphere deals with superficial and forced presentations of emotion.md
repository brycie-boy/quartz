## The left hemisphere deals with superficial and forced presentations of emotion  # 

The [[left hemisphere]] does play a role in the understanding and expression of emotion, but the differences lie in that the [[left hemisphere]] specialises in more superficial, social emotions, by contrast with the right hemisphere, which is more directly in touch with primary-process emotionality. Related to this, the [[left hemisphere]] may also be more involved in conscious representation of emotion: willed, or forced, emotional expressions, esspecially of the mouth area, are controlled by the [[left hemisphere]]. A study on conscious and unconscious processing of emotional facial expression has suggested that the left but not the right [[amygdala]] is associated with explicit representational content of the observed emotion, whereas the right [[amygdala]] is more closely involved with unconscious emotional processing.
