## The left hemisphere deals with superficial and forced presentations of emotion

The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) does play a role in the understanding and expression of emotion, but the differences lie in that the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) specialises in more superficial, social emotions, by contrast with the right hemisphere, which is more directly in touch with primary-process emotionality. Related to this, the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) may also be more involved in conscious representation of emotion: willed, or forced, emotional expressions, esspecially of the mouth area, are controlled by the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md). A study on conscious and unconscious processing of emotional facial expression has suggested that the left but not the right [amygdala](Amygdala.md) is associated with explicit representational content of the observed emotion, whereas the right [amygdala](Amygdala.md) is more closely involved with unconscious emotional processing.
