## Bio-survival anxiety will only permanently disappear when everyone has enough money

Marxists and other radicals are urgently aware of factors in ‚Äúmental health‚Äù such as how [suicide rates rise in accordance with the rise of interest rates](Suicide%20rates%20rise%20in%20accordance%20with%20the%20rise%20of%20interest%20rates.md) and hence scornful of all types of academic psychology which ignore these bio-survival issues. Unfortunately, the Marxist remedy‚Äîmaking everybody dependent for bio-survival on the whims of a State bureaucracy‚Äîis a cure worse than the disease. Bio-survival anxiety will only permanently disappear when world-wide wealth has reached a level, and a distribution, where, without totalitarianism, everyone has enough tickets. The Hunger Project, the idea of the Guaranteed Annual Income, Douglas‚Äô National Dividend plan, etc. represent groping toward that goal. The ideal can only be achieved in a technology of abundance.
