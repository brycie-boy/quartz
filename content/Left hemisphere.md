## Left hemisphere

The left brain [brain hemisphere]() is responsible for [spotlight consciousness](Spotlight%20consciousness.md). An animal needs to be able to focus their attention narrowly and with precision, kind of like a spotlight. For example, a bird needs to focus on a grain of corn that it must eat, in order to pick it out from, say, the pieces of grit on which it lies. The left hemisphere sees things abstracted from context, and broken into individual parts, from which it then reconstructs a ‘whole’. The left hemisphere is specialised in categorisation of stimuli and fine control of motor response. The left hemisphere uses a ‘local’ strategy – grouping the images according to particular features that must be invariably present. The left hemisphere is more reliant on the [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) [dopamine](Dopamine.md).
