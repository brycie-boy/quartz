## Model lIberal

One who has had his mind enlarged or ruined by a good course in epistemology might come out a fundamentalist, or absolutist, or Humean‚Äîconvinced that all proof is impossible and no idea is any more valid than another. But a wiser and less logical student might become merely a liberal Humean‚Äîone who holds that no proof is absolute but some ideas are more plausible than others, e.g. "If it rains, the streets will get wet." This is what distinguishes between liberals and [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) [materialist](Materialism.md)s.

Similarly, there are liberal [Theist]() everywhere these days, who will cheerfully admit there is no undeniable argument for God's existence, but still think the case for God a little better than the case against God. And, of course, there are [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) [Theist]()s, survivors of the Old Inquisition, who would happily burn at the stake anybody who has any doubts on the matter at all.

The liberal [materialist](Materialism.md), then, is one who holds that [materialism](Materialism.md) is a "relative best bet" among competing philosophies, or the most plausible model around, whereas the [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) [materialist](Materialism.md)‚Äîeither out of ignorance of philosophy or out of sheer bravado or out of blind faith‚Äîproclaims that materialism is the One True Philosophy and that anyone with doubts or hesitations about it is insane, perverse or a deliberate fraud. This One True Philosophy is the modern form of the One True Church of the dark ages. The [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) [materialist](Materialism.md) is the modern [Idolator](Idolatry.md); he has made an image of the world, and now he kneels and worships it.
