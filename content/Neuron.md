Neurons are the basic building blocks of the [nervous system](); their main function is to communicate with each other across tiny junctions called [synapse](Synapse.md)s. While there are many sorts of neurons, their basic design is pretty similar. Each neuron has a [soma]() that makes proteins so the neuron can stay alive. The [soma]() sends out spikes called [dendrite](Dendrite.md)s which receive [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s from other neurons and allow them to communicate with each other. Each neuron also has one long [axon](Axon.md), a special fiber that transmits this information. When a neural impulse is generated in the first [cell](), it pulses down to the end of the [axon](Axon.md), which contains little packets of [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s waiting to be released. The firing [axon](Axon.md) then shoots the [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s across the [synapse](Synapse.md) to bind to the [receptor](Receptor.md)s on the [dendrite](Dendrite.md)s of the next [cell]() either inhibiting it or exciting it to fire.
