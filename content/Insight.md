## Insight #‚è≥

Insight, when developed, leads to higher wisdom into the true nature of phenomena, which is defined by [the three characteristics](The%20three%20characteristics.md) and [emptiness](Emptiness.md), and which permanently liberates the mind from [ignorance](Ignorance.md) and ultimatley leads to the realization of [Nibbana](Nibbana.md). The cultivation of insight requires skill in observing, investigating, and discerning the nature of conditioned phenomena, or "formations.‚Äù Doing so requires intense concentration through the development of [serenity](Serenity.md). The stilled mind "sees things as they really are", that is, it observes phenomena as it arises and passes away, making [serenity](Serenity.md) the foundation for the development of insight. As Emerson put it, our ‚Äúcalm hours‚Äù reveal "that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin."
