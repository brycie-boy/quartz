## The way we attend to something changes whatever that thing is to us

Attention is not just another ‚Äòfunction‚Äô alongside other cognitive functions. Its ontological status is of something prior to functions and even to things. The kind of attention we bring to bear on the world changes the nature of the world we attend to, the very nature of the world in which those ‚Äòfunctions‚Äô would be carried out, and in which those ‚Äòthings‚Äô would exist. Attention changes what kind of a thing comes into being for us: in that way it changes the world. 

If you are my friend, the way in which I attend to you will be different from the way in which I would attend to you if you were my employer, my patient, the suspect in a crime I am investigating, my lover, my aunt, a body waiting to be dissected. In all these circumstances, except the last, you will also have a quite different experience not just of me, but of yourself: you would feel changed if I changed the type of my attention. And yet nothing objectively has changed. So it is, not just with the human world, but with everything with which we come into contact. 

For example, [Stanley Laurel]() throws a pie which hits [Oliver Hardy]() in the face. In the physicist [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md), the best description of what has happened is Newton's F equals ma (Force equals mass times acceleration). In the anthropological [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md), what has happened is a continuation of the Feast of Fools or Saturnalia or the tradition of the royal fool who is immune from the taboo against rebellion in comic form. To some Freudians, the best [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) is that the Son's rage against the Father is being expressed symbolically. To some Marxists, it is the worker's rage against the boss. Etc. There is no "real" interpretation which can be distinguished from these, no one way of thinking which reveals the true energy-event. It begins to seem that no one [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) is adequate for the description of all human experience, although some [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md)s are better for in some contexts than others are. 

Science, however, purports to be uncovering the "real" event. [Anything that cannot be measured is considered meaningless or nonexistent to science](Anything%20that%20cannot%20be%20measured%20is%20considered%20meaningless%20or%20nonexistent%20to%20science.md). Its apparently value-free descriptions are assumed to deliver the truth about the space-time event, onto which our feelings and desires are later painted. Yet this highly objective stance is itself value-laden. It is just one particular way of looking at things, a way which privileges detachment, a lack of commitment of the viewer to the object viewed. For some purposes this can be undeniably useful. But its use in such causes does not make it truer or more real, closer to the nature of things.

Attention is inescapably bound up with value‚Äîunlike what we conceive as ‚Äòcognitive functions‚Äô, which are neutral in this respect. Values enter through the way in which those functions are exercised: they can be used in different ways for different purposes to different ends. Attention, however, intrinsically is a way in which, not a thing: it is intrinsically a relationship, not a brute fact. It is a ‚Äòhowness‚Äô, a something between, an aspect of consciousness itself, not a ‚Äòwhatness‚Äô, a thing in itself, an object of consciousness. It brings into being a world and, with it, depending on its nature, a set of values.
