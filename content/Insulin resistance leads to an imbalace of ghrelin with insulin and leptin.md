## Insulin resistance leads to an imbalace of ghrelin with insulin and leptin

When [insulin](Insulin.md) is low and working right, both [insulin](Insulin.md) and [leptin](Leptin.md) counterbalance [ghrelin](Ghrelin.md) and keep you weight-stable. But when you become [insulin resistant](Insulin%20resistance.md), the [leptin](Leptin.md) signal is blocked—now the [ghrelin](Ghrelin.md) runs things, so you’re hungrier and storing like crazy. Therefore, the prime directive of metabolic therapy is “get the [insulin](Insulin.md) down.” And that’s true, regardless of your weight.
