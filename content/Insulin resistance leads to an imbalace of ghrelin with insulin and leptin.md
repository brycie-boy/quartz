## Insulin resistance leads to an imbalace of ghrelin with insulin and leptin  # 

When [[insulin]] is low and working right, both [[insulin]] and [[leptin]] counterbalance [[ghrelin]] and keep you weight-stable. But when you become [[Insulin resistance|insulin resistant]], the [[leptin]] signal is blocked—now the [[ghrelin]] runs things, so you’re hungrier and storing like crazy. Therefore, the prime directive of metabolic therapy is “get the [[insulin]] down.” And that’s true, regardless of your weight.
