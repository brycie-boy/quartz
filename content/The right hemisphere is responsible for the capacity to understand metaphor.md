## The right hemisphere is responsible for the capacity to understand metaphor

Particularly important difference between the [brain hemisphere]()s lies in the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s capacity to understand metaphor. The right [temporal lobe]() appears to be essential for the integration of two seemingly unrelated concepts into a meaningful metaphoric expression. Fascinatingly, however, clich√©d metaphorical or non-literal expressions are dealt with in the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md): for such an expression, it is seeing the literal meaning of the hackneyed phrase that refreshes it, that requires insight (a bit like seeing a joke), and therefore in this case the non-salient (unfamiliar, because non-clich√©d) meaning gets to be processed in the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md).
