## The right hemisphere is responsible for the capacity to understand metaphor # 

Particularly important difference between the [[brain hemisphere]]s lies in the [[right hemisphere]]'s capacity to understand metaphor. The right [[temporal lobe]] appears to be essential for the integration of two seemingly unrelated concepts into a meaningful metaphoric expression. Fascinatingly, however, clich√©d metaphorical or non-literal expressions are dealt with in the [[left hemisphere]]: for such an expression, it is seeing the literal meaning of the hackneyed phrase that refreshes it, that requires insight (a bit like seeing a joke), and therefore in this case the non-salient (unfamiliar, because non-clich√©d) meaning gets to be processed in the [[right hemisphere]].
