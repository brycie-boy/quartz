## The three unwholesome roots  #üß†

The three unwholesome roots and the offshoots which stem from them are the underlying motives which lead to [unwholesome kamma](Unwholesome%20kamma.md). These include:

* greed ([Mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md))
* hatred ([Stress-fear-memory pathway](Stress-fear-memory%20pathway.md))

both of which are perpetuated by the third unwholesome root:

* [ignorance](Ignorance.md)

The secondary offshoots include:

* anger
* hostility
* envy
* selfishness
* arrogance
* pride
* presumption
* laziness
