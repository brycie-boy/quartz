## The three unwholesome roots  #üß† 

The three unwholesome roots and the offshoots which stem from them are the underlying motives which lead to [[unwholesome kamma]]. These include:

- greed ([[Mesolimbic pathway]])
- hatred ([[Stress-fear-memory pathway]])

both of which are perpetuated by the third unwholesome root:

- [[ignorance]]

The secondary offshoots include:

- anger
- hostility
- envy
- selfishness
- arrogance
- pride
- presumption
- laziness

I believe the wholesome roots to involve the [[left hemisphere]] because [[a right hemisphere stroke is more disabling than a left in that one loses the ability to socialize and empathize]]. And also because the [[left hemisphere]] is more reliant on the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]], making the [[mesolimbic pathway]] more dominant in the [[left hemisphere]].
