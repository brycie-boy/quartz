## The three unwholesome roots  #üß†

The three unwholesome roots and the offshoots which stem from them are the underlying motives which lead to [unwholesome kamma](Unwholesome%20kamma.md). These include:

* greed ([Mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md))
* hatred ([Stress-fear-memory pathway](Stress-fear-memory%20pathway.md))

both of which are perpetuated by the third unwholesome root:

* [ignorance](Ignorance.md)

The secondary offshoots include:

* anger
* hostility
* envy
* selfishness
* arrogance
* pride
* presumption
* laziness

I believe the wholesome roots to involve the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) because [a right hemisphere stroke is more disabling than a left in that one loses the ability to socialize and empathize](A%20right%20hemisphere%20stroke%20is%20more%20disabling%20than%20a%20left%20in%20that%20one%20loses%20the%20ability%20to%20socialize%20and%20empathize.md). And also because the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is more reliant on the [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) [dopamine](Dopamine.md), making the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) more dominant in the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md).
