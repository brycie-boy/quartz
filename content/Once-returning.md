## Once-returning

Once-returning is the second stage of [the four stages of awakening](The%20four%20stages%20of%20awakening.md). This stage does not involve the eradication any new fetters. The once-returner eliminates the same three fetters destroyed with the attainment of [stream-entry](Stream-entry.md) and additionaly attenuates [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md) so that they do not arise often and if they do arise do not become obsessive. As the name implies, the once-returner will come back to this world only one more time and then attain final [Nibbana](Nibbana.md).
