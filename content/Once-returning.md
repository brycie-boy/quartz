## Once-returning  #

Once-returning is the second stage of [[the four stages of awakening]]. This stage does not involve the eradication any new fetters. The once-returner eliminates the same three fetters destroyed with the attainment of [[stream-entry]] and additionaly attenuates [[the three unwholesome roots]] so that they do not arise often and if they do arise do not become obsessive. As the name implies, the once-returner will come back to this world only one more time and then attain final [[Nibbana]].
