## The existential vacuum has spread through humanity due to the lack of a central tradition to our their lives

[The existential vacuum has spread through humanity due to the lack of instincts to help guide human behavior](The%20existential%20vacuum%20has%20spread%20through%20humanity%20due%20to%20the%20lack%20of%20instincts%20to%20help%20guide%20human%20behavior.md). In addition to this, however, humanity has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed its behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do ([conformity](Conformity.md)) or he does what other people wish him to do ([totalitarianism]()).
