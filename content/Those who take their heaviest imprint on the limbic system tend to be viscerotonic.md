## Those who take their heaviest imprint on the limbic system tend to be viscerotonic

In extreme cases, those who take their heaviest [imprint](Imprint.md) on the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) tend to be viscerotonic, because this [imprint](Imprint.md) determines lifelong [endocrine]() and glandular processes. Thus, in the extreme they are ‚Äúbaby-faced‚Äù in adult life, never lose their ‚Äúbaby-fat,‚Äù are plump and round and gentle, etc. Also, [a secure attachment in childhood is necessary for the development of the capacity to be alone](A%20secure%20attachment%20in%20childhood%20is%20necessary%20for%20the%20development%20of%20the%20capacity%20to%20be%20alone.md), so they are easily ‚Äúhurt‚Äù (threatened/terrified) by disapproval of any sort, because in the baby-circuit of the brain, disapproval suggests extinction by loss of the food supply.
