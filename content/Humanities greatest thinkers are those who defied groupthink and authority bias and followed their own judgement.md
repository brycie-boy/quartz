## Humanities greatest thinkers are those who defied groupthink and authority bias and followed their own judgement #üß†

When we encounter an unconventional idea, the sentiment that these ideas instill may be of more value than the idea itself. To trust in your own thought, and to place one's thoughts into the world because we believe they may reveal something universal constitutes what we call genius. The highest merit that we ascribe to humanities greatest thinkers is that they did not give way to [groupthink](Groupthink.md) or [authority bias](Authority%20bias.md), but rather they spoke what they personally thought and shifted the paradigm.
