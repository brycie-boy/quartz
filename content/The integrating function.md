## The integrating function

The integrating function is one of [Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school](Alexander%20Inglis%20six%20basic%20functions%20of%20school.md). This might well be called ‚Äúthe [conformity](Conformity.md) function,‚Äù because its intention is to make children as alike as possible. People who [conform](Conformity.md) are predictable because [identifying with a group obscures your true character and makes you predictible](Identifying%20with%20a%20group%20obscures%20your%20true%20character%20and%20makes%20you%20predictible.md), and this is of great use to those who wish to harness and manipulate a large [proletariat](Proletariat.md) class. Schools implement the integrating function through the process in which [the numbering, grading, and ordering of students conditions them to tacitly accept their hierachical position](The%20numbering,%20grading,%20and%20ordering%20of%20students%20conditions%20them%20to%20tacitly%20accept%20their%20hierachical%20position.md).
