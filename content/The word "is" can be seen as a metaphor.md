## The word "is" can be seen as a metaphor

Since [language can be seen as a kind of metaphor](Language%20can%20be%20seen%20as%20a%20kind%20of%20metaphor.md), consider the word "is" in the sense of [essentialist](Essentialism.md) identification ‚Äî as in A *is* a B. This appears very useful mathematically, because numbers of a mathematical set exist abstractly, but what about when the word as applied to sensory events? Consider pronouncements such as "this *is* a great work of art," "this *is* meaningless drivel," "this *is* Communism," "this *is* fascism," "this *is* sexism." When we consider that [because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential](Because%20perception%20is%20not%20absolute,%20all%20of%20our%20ideas%20are%20somewhat%20conjectural%20and%20inferential.md), such statements should be a bit more complicated‚Äîe.g. "this seems like a great work of art to me," this seems like meaningless drivel to me," "this seems like Communism to me," "this seems like fascism to me," "this seems like sexism to me."

Of course, when this is pointed out, people will say that the latter formulations are what they really mean and that the [essentialist](Essentialism.md) "is" was only used for convenience or brevity. But if you observe such people carefully, you will notice that language does indeed have hypnotic effects, and when someone who says "this *is* sacred" will treat something as if it really *is* sacred, and those who say "this *is* crap" will treat something as if it really were crap.
