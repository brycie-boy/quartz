[[people with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response]], and there may be problems with the [[hippocampus]] in people with major [[depression]]. This speculation was reinforced by the fact that the type of memory most often impaired in depression—[[declarative memory]]—is mediated by the [[hippocampus]]. [[Elevated levels of cortisol can shrink the hippocampus]]. The atrophy emerges as a result of the [[depression]] (rather than precedes it).
