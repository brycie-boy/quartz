## Heading

[people with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response](People%20with%20depression%20generally%20have%20higher%20levels%20of%20glucocorticoids%20due%20to%20an%20overactive%20stress-response.md), and there may be problems with the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md) in people with major [depression](Depression.md). This speculation was reinforced by the fact that the type of memory most often impaired in depression—[declarative memory]()—is mediated by the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md). [Elevated levels of cortisol can shrink the hippocampus](Elevated%20levels%20of%20cortisol%20can%20shrink%20the%20hippocampus.md). The atrophy emerges as a result of the [depression](Depression.md) (rather than precedes it).
