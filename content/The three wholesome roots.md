## The three wholesome roots  #‚è≥

The three wholesome roots are three underlying motives that lead to [wholesome kamma](Wholesome%20kamma.md). They are the opposite of [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md). These include:

* generosity
* [loving-kindness](Loving-kindness.md)

Which are perpetuated by the third wholesome root:

* wisdom (knowledge of [the four nobel truths](The%20four%20nobel%20truths.md))

I believe the three wholesome roots to involve the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), as [the right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20our%20capacity%20for%20emotional%20understanding.md).
