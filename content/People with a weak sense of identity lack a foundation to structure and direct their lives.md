## People with a weak sense of identity lack a foundation to structure and direct their lives and feel a sense of emptiness

One‚Äôs sense of identity can be seen as existing on a spectrum. On the one side of this spectrum are those with a strong identity, such people feel they have a place in the world, they know what they want with their lives and they take the necessary actions to move in the direction of their goals. On the other side of the spectrum are those with a weak identity, resulting in a feeling of emptiness. Such individuals lack a clear conception of what they want with their life, they have no long-term goals around which to structure their days, and so they feel powerless to positively influence their situation. These people tend to drift through life in a passive manner, they follow the path of least resistance, and are often crippled by existential doubts.
