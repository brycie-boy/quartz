## Opioid peptide  #üß†

Endogenous opioid peptides are [neuropeptides]() that bind to opioid [receptor](Receptor.md)s in the [brain](Brain.md) and generally generate feelings of consummation, pleasure, and bliss. These opioids surge into [synapse](Synapse.md)s and strengthen the neural circuits that are active, making them more likely to fire together in the future.
