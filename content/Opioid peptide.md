## Opioid peptide  #🧠 

Endogenous opioid peptides are [[neuropeptides]] that bind to opioid [[receptor]]s in the [[brain]] and generally generate feelings of consummation, pleasure, and bliss. These opioids surge into [[synapse]]s and strengthen the neural circuits that are active, making them more likely to fire together in the future.
