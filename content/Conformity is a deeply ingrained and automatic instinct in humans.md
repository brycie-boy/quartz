## Conformity is a deeply ingrained and automatic instinct in humans # 

The deeply ingrained nature of [[conformity]] in humans is shown by the ages when they are apparent. Zillions of pages have been written about [[conformity]] and peer pressure in kids. One study nicely demonstrates the continuity of [[conformity]] between us and other species. This was the report that a chimp was more likely to conform to the behaviors of three individuals doing a behavior once each than to one individual doing the behavior three times (see [[Primates have been shown to copy an action if they see others doing it]]). The study showed the same in two-year-old humans.

The depths of human [[conformity]] are shown by the speed with which they occur‚Äîit takes less than 200 milliseconds for your [[brain]] to register that the group has picked a different answer from yours, and less than 380 milliseconds for a profile of activation that predicts changing your opinion. Our [[brain]]s are biased to get along by going along in less than a second.
