## Those with impairments in the right frontolimbic regions have trouble with stopping whatever they're currently doing # 

A connection can also be made with the right [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], and a rather fundamental difference between the hemispheres. The [[left hemisphere]]'s ‚Äòstickiness‚Äô, its tendency to recur to what it is familiar with ([[the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]), also tends to reinforce whatever it is already doing. The [[right hemisphere]] by contrast, seeing more of the picture ([[The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention]]), and taking a broader perspective that characteristically includes both its own and the [[left hemisphere]]'s ([[the right hemisphere is able to use the left hemispheres style of cognition, but the left cannot use the rights]]), is more reciprocally inclined, and more likely to espouse another point of view.

One way of thinking of this is in terms of feedback systems. Most biological systems seek [[homeostasis]]: if they move too far in one direction, they stabilize themselves by self-correction. This is ‚Äònegative feedback‚Äô, the most familiar example of which is the operation of a thermostat: if the temperature constantly tends to drop, the thermostat triggers a heating system that will act to bring the temperature back to the desired level. However, systems can become unstable and enter a situation in which ‚Äòpositive feedback‚Äô obtains‚Äîin other words, a move in one direction, rather than producing a move in the opposite direction, serves to promote further moves in the same direction, and a snowballing effect occurs.

The [[right hemisphere]], then, is capable of freeing us through negative feedback. The [[left hemisphere]] tends toward positive feedback, and we can become stuck. This is not unlike the difference between the normal drinker and the [[Addiction|addict]]. After a certain point, the normal drinker begins to feel less like having another drink. What makes an [[Addiction|addict]] is the lack of an ‚Äòoff switch‚Äô‚Äîanother drink only makes the next, and the next, more likely. And, interestingly enough, lesions of the frontolimbic systems, mainly in the [[right hemisphere]], are associated with [[Addiction|addictive]] behavior. Pathological gamblers, for example, have frontal deficits which are mainly right-sided; by contrast, in [[cocaine]] [[Addiction|addicts]], for example, stimulating the right [[prefrontal cortex]] reduces craving for cocaine. And denial, a [[left hemisphere]] specialty ([[The left hemisphere is prone to over-optimistic denial]]), is typical of [[addiction]].
