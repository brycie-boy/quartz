## Psychiatric medications paper over symptoms rather than dealing with their cause # 

- [[Modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it]], and this goes not only for physical illness, but [[mental illness]] as well. Psychiatric medications supposedly fix a chemical imbalance in the [[brain]]. However, [[psychiatry has not yet been able to come up with laboratory tests for psychiatric conditions]]. Then what are these drugs really doing? They clearly do not fix a chemical imbalance, but instead shift [[neurotransmitter]] levels abnormally high or low. Rather than actually addressing what ever it is that is causing your symptoms in the first place, it simply papers over the symptoms making you more comfortably numb. Then you can be subjected to exploitation and oppression without protest.
- Amazon warehouses give free pain meds, not out of empathy and beneficence, but want you to keep working.
