## The fourth jhana  #⏳

The fourth of [the jhanas](The%20jhanas.md) involves the abandoning of pleasure and pain and the purification of [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) by [equanimity](Equanimity.md). 

From the fourth jhana, three lines of development become possible. The first line is the [the formless attainments](The%20formless%20attainments.md). The second line is the acquisition of [supernormal powers](Supernormal%20Powers.md). The third line is the knowledge of the destruction of [the taints](The%20taints.md).
