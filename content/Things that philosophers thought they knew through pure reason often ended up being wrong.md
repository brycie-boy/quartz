## Things that philosophers thought they knew through pure reason often ended up being wrong #🧠 

[[Because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential]]. However, the Greek philosophers, or some of them, regarded [[pure reason]] as a path to certitude. This has collapsed over the centuries for a variety of reasons, but chiefly because the things philosophers thought they knew this way have often turned out to be simply not true. For instance, [[Immanuel Kant]] thought pure reason "knew" intuitively that [[Euclidean geometry]] was the true and only geometry. Nowadays, mathematicians have several varieties of non-[[Euclidean geometry]], all of which are equally valid and all of which are as useful as [[Euclidean geometry]], although in different areas.
