## School fosters mental illness by stripping students of control and Independence

[Free play can elevate mental illness in students by giving them a sense of control, allowing them to confront risk, letting them learn social skills and allowing to find their passions](Free%20play%20can%20elevate%20mental%20illness%20in%20students%20by%20giving%20them%20a%20sense%20of%20control,%20allowing%20them%20to%20confront%20risk,%20letting%20them%20learn%20social%20skills%20and%20allowing%20to%20find%20their%20passions.md). In school, by contrast, children cannot make their own decisions; their job is to do as they are told. In school, children learn that what matters are test scores. Even outside of school, children spend increasing amounts of their time in settings where they are directed, protected, catered to, ranked, judged, criticized, praised, and rewarded by adults. 

In a series of research studies conducted in wealthy suburban neighborhoods in the northeastern United States, psychologist [Suniya Luthar]() and her colleagues found that those children who felt most pressured by their parents to achieve in school and were most frequently shuttled from one extracurricular activity to another were the most likely to feel anxious or depressed. Every time we reduce children‚Äôs opportunities for free play by increasing their time at school or at other adult-directed activities, we reduce further their opportunities to learn to control their own lives, to learn that they are not simply victims of circumstances and powerful others.
