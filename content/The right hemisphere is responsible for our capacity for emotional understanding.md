## The right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding

The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) has by far the preponderance of emotional understanding. It is the mediator of social behavior. In the absence of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is unconcerned about others and their feelings. Social intercourse is conducted with a blanket disregard for the feelings, wishes, needs and expectations of others. Patients with deficits in the right [orbitofrontal cortex](Orbitofrontal%20cortex.md), but not left, suffer a change of personality whereby they become incapable of empathy.
