## Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment has been criticized for him being too involved # 

[[Stanley Milgram had shown that people would continue to shock someone who missed an answer to a question to deadly levels if ordered to by authority]]. And [[Philip Zimbardo showed in Stanford Prison Experiment that those designated position as guard would comply to commands to commit cruelties toward prisoners]]. Between [[Stanley Milgram|Milgram]] and [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]]'s studies, the Stanford Prison Experiment has arguably attracted the most controversy. 

The biggest lightning rod was the role of [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]] himself. Rather than being a detached observer, he served as the prison‚Äôs ‚Äúsuperintendent.‚Äù He set the ground rules (e.g., telling guards that they could make the prisoners feel afraid and helpless) and met regularly with the guards throughout. He was clearly excited as hell to see what was happening in the study. [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]] is a larger-than-life force of nature, someone whom you‚Äôd very much wish to please. Thus guards were subject to pressure not only to conform with their cohort but also to obey and please [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]]; his role, consciously or otherwise, almost certainly prompted the guards to more extreme behavior. [[Philip Zimbardo|Zimbardo]], a humane, decent man who is a friend and colleague, has written at length about this distortive impact that he had on the study.
