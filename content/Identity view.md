## Identity view  #‚è≥

Giving up [craving](Craving.md) is so difficult because [craving](Craving.md) is reinforced by views, which [rationalize](Rationalization.md) our identification with [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md) and thus equip [craving](Craving.md) with a protective shield. The type of view that lies at the bottom of all affirmation of selfhood. [The Nikayas]() often mention twenty types of identity view, obtained by considering oneself to stand in relation to each of [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md): either as being identical with it, as possesing it, as containing it, or as being contained within it. Adopting any of these views is a cause of anxiety and distress. Much of human suffering stems from having this self that needs to be psychologically defended at all costs. It is through [insight](Insight.md) into [the three characteristics](The%20three%20characteristics.md) that ones sees the true nature of [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md) and no longer regards them as self or the belongings of a self.
