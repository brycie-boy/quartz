## The right frontal lobes enables one to step back form espousing ‚Äòmy‚Äô position, which enables us to empathize and consider the others point of view

For example, if the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s immediacy of association with emotion ([The right hemisphere is responsible for emotional expression](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20emotional%20expression.md)) and the body ([The right hemisphere sees the body as something we live, while the for the left it is devitalized](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20the%20body%20as%20something%20we%20live,%20while%20the%20for%20the%20left%20it%20is%20devitalized.md)) leads it to prioritize what is close, what is ‚Äòmine‚Äô, the right [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md) brings distance and delay to espousing ‚Äòmy‚Äô position. As a result it enables others to stand forth as individuals like ‚Äòme‚Äô; it enables a broader empathy and the beginnings of altruism. This is not a negation of something by the [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md), but a modulation of it, an ‚Äòunpacking‚Äô, if you like, of something that was there all along, albeit in germ only‚Äîsomething that comes to life only when a degree of necessary distance is interposed.
