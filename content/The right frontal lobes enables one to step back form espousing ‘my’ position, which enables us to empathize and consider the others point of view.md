## The right frontal lobes enables one to step back form espousing ‘my’ position, which enables us to empathize and consider the others point of view # 

For example, if the [[right hemisphere]]'s immediacy of association with emotion and the body ([[the right hemisphere is much more involved in emotions and bodily experience than the left hemisphere]]) leads it to prioritize what is close, what is ‘mine’, the right [[frontal lobe]] brings distance and delay to espousing ‘my’ position. As a result it enables others to stand forth as individuals like ‘me’; it enables a broader empathy and the beginnings of altruism. This is not a negation of something by the [[frontal lobe]], but a modulation of it, an ‘unpacking’, if you like, of something that was there all along, albeit in germ only—something that comes to life only when a degree of necessary distance is interposed.
