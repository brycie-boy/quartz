## Contemplation of feeling  #⏳ 

Contemplation of [[feeling]] is one of [[The establishments of mindfulness]]. It is described by [[The Buddha]] as follows: 

> “And how ... does a monk dwell contemplating ...  feelings? Here, when feeling a pleasant feeling, a monk understands: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling’; when feeling a painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a painful feeling’; when feeling a [neutral] feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a [neutral] feeling.’ When feeling a carnal pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a carnal pleasant feeling’; when feeling a spiritual pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a spiritual pleasant feeling’; when feeling a carnal painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a carnal painful feeling’; when feeling a spiritual painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a spiritual painful feeling’; when feeling a carnal [neutral] feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a carnal [neutral] feeling’; when feeling a spiritual [neutral] feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a spiritual [neutral] feeling.’
