## Contemplation of feeling  #⏳

Contemplation of [feeling](Feeling.md) is one of [The establishments of mindfulness](The%20establishments%20of%20mindfulness.md). It is described by [The Buddha]() as follows: 

 > 
 > “And how ... does a monk dwell contemplating ...  feelings? Here, when feeling a pleasant feeling, a monk understands: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling’; when feeling a painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a painful feeling’; when feeling a \[neutral\] feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a \[neutral\] feeling.’ When feeling a carnal pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a carnal pleasant feeling’; when feeling a spiritual pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a spiritual pleasant feeling’; when feeling a carnal painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a carnal painful feeling’; when feeling a spiritual painful feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a spiritual painful feeling’; when feeling a carnal \[neutral\] feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a carnal \[neutral\] feeling’; when feeling a spiritual \[neutral\] feeling, he understands: ‘I feel a spiritual \[neutral\] feeling.’
