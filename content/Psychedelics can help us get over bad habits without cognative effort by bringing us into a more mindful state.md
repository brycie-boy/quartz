## Psychedelics can help us get over bad habits without cognative effort by bringing us into a more mindful state

The insights people have from a [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md) experience tend to be surprisingly banal. Not that their journeys were banal‚Äî[psilocybin]() transported them all over the world and through history and to outer space‚Äîbut the insights they brought back with them were mundane in the extreme. Dr. [Matthew Johnson]() refers to these realizations as ‚Äúduh moments‚Äù and says they are common among his volunteers and not at all insignificant. Smokers know perfectly well that their [habit](Habit.md) is unhealthy, but under the influence of [psilocybin]() that knowing acquires a new weight, it becomes something they feel in thier bones rather than their [brain](Brain.md)s. They move from [conceptual understanding](Conceptual%20understanding.md) to [Experiential understanding](Experiential%20understanding.md). Insights like these become more compelling, stickier, and harder to avoid thinking about. These sessions deprive people of the luxury of mindlessness‚Äîour state of brought about by the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md)‚Äîand one in which [addiction](Addiction.md)s and [habit](Habit.md)s flourish, and puts us into a [mindful](Mindfulness.md) one. Similarly, [mindfulness can allow us to get over bad habits without congnitive effort](Mindfulness%20can%20allow%20us%20to%20get%20over%20bad%20habits%20without%20congnitive%20effort.md). 

Johnson believes the value of [psilocybin]() for the [addict](Addiction.md) is in the new perspective‚Äîat once obvious and profound‚Äîthat it opens onto one‚Äôs life and its [habit](Habit.md)s. [Addiction](Addiction.md) is a story we get stuck in, a story that gets [reinforced](Operant%20conditioning.md) every time we try and fail to quit: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a smoker and I‚Äôm powerless to stop.‚Äô The journey allows them to get some distance and see the bigger picture and to see the short-term pleasures of smoking in the larger, longer-term context of their lives.

Of course, this re-contextualization of an old [habit](Habit.md) doesn‚Äôt just happen; countless people have taken [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s and continued to smoke. If it does happen, it‚Äôs because breaking the [habit](Habit.md) is the avowed intention of the session, strongly [reinforced](Operant%20conditioning.md) by the therapist in the preparatory meetings and the integration afterward. The ‚Äúset‚Äù of the [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md) journey is carefully orchestrated by the therapist in much the same way a shaman would use his authority and stagecraft to maximize the medicine‚Äôs deep powers of suggestion.
