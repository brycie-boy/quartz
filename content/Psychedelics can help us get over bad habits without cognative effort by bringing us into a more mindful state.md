## Psychedelics can help us get over bad habits without cognative effort by bringing us into a more mindful state # 

The insights people have from a [[psychedelic]] experience tend to be surprisingly banal. Not that their journeys were banal—[[psilocybin]] transported them all over the world and through history and to outer space—but the insights they brought back with them were mundane in the extreme. Dr. [[Matthew Johnson]] refers to these realizations as “duh moments” and says they are common among his volunteers and not at all insignificant. Smokers know perfectly well that their [[habit]] is unhealthy, but under the influence of [[psilocybin]] that knowing acquires a new weight, it becomes something they feel in thier bones rather than their [[brain]]s. They move from [[conceptual understanding]] to [[Experiential understanding]]. Insights like these become more compelling, stickier, and harder to avoid thinking about. These sessions deprive people of the luxury of mindlessness—our state of brought about by the [[default mode network]]—and one in which [[addiction]]s and [[habit]]s flourish, and puts us into a [[Mindfulness|mindful]] one. Similarly, [[Mindfulness can allow us to get over bad habits without cognitive effort]]. 

Johnson believes the value of [[psilocybin]] for the [[Addiction|addict]] is in the new perspective—at once obvious and profound—that it opens onto one’s life and its [[habit]]s. [[Addiction]] is a story we get stuck in, a story that gets [[Operant conditioning|reinforced]] every time we try and fail to quit: ‘I’m a smoker and I’m powerless to stop.’ The journey allows them to get some distance and see the bigger picture and to see the short-term pleasures of smoking in the larger, longer-term context of their lives.

Of course, this re-contextualization of an old [[habit]] doesn’t just happen; countless people have taken [[psychedelic]]s and continued to smoke. If it does happen, it’s because breaking the [[habit]] is the avowed intention of the session, strongly [[Operant conditioning|reinforced]] by the therapist in the preparatory meetings and the integration afterward. The “set” of the [[psychedelic]] journey is carefully orchestrated by the therapist in much the same way a shaman would use his authority and stagecraft to maximize the medicine’s deep powers of suggestion.
