## The right hemisphere presents the world with detail and depth, while the left represents it abstractly, undetailed and even in one plane # 

[[The right hemisphere allows for the sense of spatial depth, whereas the left understands depth categorically, i.e. above, below]]. The [[right hemisphere]] tends to present the world realistically, with visual detail and in three dimensions, with depth; and an aesthetic sense of the intensity and beauty of visual representations comes largely from the [[right hemisphere]]. The [[right hemisphere]] represents objects as having volume and depth in space, as they are experienced; the [[left hemisphere]] tends to represent the visual world schematically, abstractly, geometrically, with a lack of realistic detail, and even in one plane. Drawings of buildings, in individuals with an inactivated [[right hemisphere]], may even be laid out flat with all facades simultaneously visible, as in a child's drawing. A patient studied by [[Micheal Gazzaniga]] and [[Joseph LeDoux]], who underwent a commissurotomy, could draw a cube normally with either hand prior to the operation, but following the procedure could draw only a poor diagram with his favored right hand, though the left hand was able to draw a 3-dimensional construct of a cube.
