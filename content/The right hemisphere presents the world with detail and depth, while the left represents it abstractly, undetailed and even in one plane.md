## The right hemisphere presents the world with detail and depth, while the left represents it abstractly, undetailed and even in one plane

[The right hemisphere allows for the sense of spatial depth, whereas the left understands depth categorically, i.e. above, below](The%20right%20hemisphere%20allows%20for%20the%20sense%20of%20spatial%20depth,%20whereas%20the%20left%20understands%20depth%20categorically,%20i.e.%20above,%20below.md). The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) tends to present the world realistically, with visual detail and in three dimensions, with depth; and an aesthetic sense of the intensity and beauty of visual representations comes largely from the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md). The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) represents objects as having volume and depth in space, as they are experienced; the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) tends to represent the visual world schematically, abstractly, geometrically, with a lack of realistic detail, and even in one plane. Drawings of buildings, in individuals with an inactivated [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), may even be laid out flat with all facades simultaneously visible, as in a child's drawing. A patient studied by [Micheal Gazzaniga]() and [Joseph LeDoux](), who underwent a commissurotomy, could draw a cube normally with either hand prior to the operation, but following the procedure could draw only a poor diagram with his favored right hand, though the left hand was able to draw a 3-dimensional construct of a cube.
