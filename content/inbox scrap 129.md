The various   
phenomena in this world and other worlds are in all cases   
devoid of intrinsic nature. They are also devoid of any nature   
that manifests itself.1 They are empty names, and the words   
used to describe them are likewise empty. But you insist on   
mistaking these idle names for reality. This is a great error.   
Even if something did exist, it would in all cases be no more   
than an environment that changes with what it depends on.

“And things like the Three Vehicles’ and the twelve divisions of the scriptural teachings —they’re all so much old toilet paper to wipe away filth. The Buddha is a phantom body,   
the patriarchs are nothing but old monks.

“Followers of the Way, the true Buddha is without form,   
the true Dharma is without characteristics. You are striking   
poses and dunning attitudes all because of a mere phantom.   
Even if in your seeking you got something, it would all be   
the work of wild fox spirits, certainly not the true Buddha.   
It would be the understanding of the non-Buddhists.

Followers of the Way, those who have left household life   
need to study the Way. I myself in past years turned my attention to the vinaya, w and I also delved into the sutras and   
treatises. But later I realized that these are just medicines to   
cure the sickness of the world, expositions of surface matters.   
So finally I tossed them aside and sought the Way through   
Ch’an practice.

“Followers of the Way, if you want to get the kind of understanding that accords with the Dharma, never be misled   
bv others. W hether vou re facing inward or facing outward,   
whatever you meet up with, just kill it! If you meet a buddha,   
kill the buddha. If you meet a patriarch, kill the patriarch. II   
you meet an arhat, kill the arhat. If you meet your parents,   
kill your parents. If you meet your kinfolk, kill your kinfolk.   
Then for the first time you will gain emancipation, will not   
be entangled with things, will pass freely anywhere you wish   
to go.20
