## Existential frustration # 

Someones [[will to meaning]] can also be frustrated, in which case [[logotherapy]] speaks of “existential frustration.” The term “existential” may be used in three ways: to refer to (1) existence itself, i.e., the specifically human mode of being; (2) the meaning of existence; and (3) the striving to find a concrete meaning in personal existence, that is to say, the [[will to meaning]].
