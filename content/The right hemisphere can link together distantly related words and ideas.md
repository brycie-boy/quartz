## The right hemisphere can link together distantly related words and ideas

This difference in the [brain hemisphere]()s are not predicated on any of the old distinctions such as verbal versus visuospatial. It operates equally in the realm of attention to verbal information. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) actively narrows its attentional focus to highly related words while the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) activates a broader range of words. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) operates focally, suppressing meanings that are not currently relevant. By contrast, the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) processes information in a non-focal manner with widespread activation of related meanings. Whereas close lexical semantic relationships rely more on the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), looser semantic associations rely on the right. 

Because the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) makes infrequent or distantly related word meanings available, there is increased [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) involvement when generating unusual or distantly related words or novel uses for objects. This may be one of many aspects that tend to associate the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) with a freer, more ‚Äòcreative‚Äô style. The right [anterior temporal region]() is associated with [Po](Po.md) thinking, and the right [posterior superior temporal sulcus]() may be selectively involved in verbal creativity. In the ‚Äòclose‚Äô situation, by contrast, the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) actively suppresses the right, to exclude associations which are semantically only distantly related.
