### Annotations

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3887
  The Shorter Discourse to Māluṅkyāputta (MN 63), shows that the Buddhist path is not designed to provide theoretical answers to philosophical questions.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3888
  In this sutta the monk Māluṅkyāputta approaches the Buddha and demands answers to ten speculative questions, threatening to leave the Saṅgha if this demand is not satisfied.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4002
  “These speculative views have been left undeclared by the Blessed One, set aside and rejected by him, namely: ‘the world is eternal’ and ‘the world is not eternal’; ‘the world is finite’ and ‘the world is infinite’; ‘the soul is the same as the body’ and ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’; and ‘after death a Tathāgata exists’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’
  (Majjhima Nikaya 63: Cūḷamāluṅkya Sutta; I 426–32)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3891
  Two collections of suttas in the Saṃyutta Nikāya—SN 33:1–10 and SN 44:7–8—make it clear that the Buddha’s “silence” had a deeper basis than mere pragmatic concerns.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3892
  These suttas show that all such questions are based on an underlying assumption that existence is to be interpreted in terms of a self and a world in which the self is situated. Since these premises are invalid, no answer framed in terms of these premises can be valid, and thus the Buddha must reject the very questions themselves.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3895
  However, while the Buddha had philosophical grounds for refusing to answer these questions, he also rejected them because he considered the obsession with their solutions to be irrelevant to the quest for release from suffering.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4057
  “Why have I left that undeclared? Because it is unbeneficial, it does not belong to the fundamentals of the spiritual life, it does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 63: Cūḷamāluṅkya Sutta; I 426–32)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4043
  ’If there is the view ‘the world is finite’ ... ‘the world is infinite’ ‘the soul is the same as the body’ ... ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’ … ‘after death a Tathāgata exists’ … ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived.… If there is the view ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist... there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair, the destruction of which I prescribe here and now.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 63: Cūḷamāluṅkya Sutta; I 426–32)

  the purpose of practicing the spiritual life under the Buddha is “the fading away of lust, … final Nibbāna without clinging,” the Noble Eightfold Path being the way to attain each of these aims

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4147
  “Monks, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is the spiritual life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘It is, friends, for the fading away of lust
  (Samyutta Nikaya 45:41–48, combined; V 27–29)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4155
  \[Or else you may answer them:\] ‘It is, friends, for the abandoning of the fetters … for the uprooting of the underlying tendencies … for the full understanding of the course \[of saṃsāra\] … for the destruction of the taints … for the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation … for the sake of knowledge and vision … for the sake of final Nibbāna without clinging that the spiritual life is lived under the Blessed One.’
  (Samyutta Nikaya 45:41–48, combined; V 27–29)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3911
  The Noble Eightfold Path is the classical formulation of the way to liberation, as is already clear from the Buddha’s first sermon, in which he calls the Eightfold Path the way to the cessation of suffering.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3923
  The eight factors are commonly distributed into three groups as follows:

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3924
  the moral discipline group (sīlakkhandha), made up of right speech, right action, and right livelihood;

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4172
  “And what, monks, is right speech? Abstinence from false speech, abstinence from malicious speech, abstinence from harsh speech, abstinence from idle chatter: this is called right speech.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4175
  “And what, monks, is right livelihood? Here a noble disciple, having abandoned a wrong mode of livelihood, earns his living by a right livelihood: this is called right livelihood.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4173
  “And what, monks, is right action? Abstinence from the destruction of life, abstinence from taking what is not given, abstinence from sexual misconduct: this is called right action.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3926
  the concentration group (sam̄dhikkhandha), made up of right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration;

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4176
  “And what, monks, is right effort? Here, monks, a monk generates desire for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states…. He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome states…. He generates desire for the continuation of arisen wholesome states, for their nondecline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called right effort.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4181
  “And what, monks is right mindfulness? Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body,
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4182
  He dwells contemplating feelings
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4183
  He dwells contemplating mind in mind,
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4184
  He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena,
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4184
  ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world. This is called right mindfulness.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4185
  “And what, monks, is right concentration?
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4186
  first jhāna,
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4186
  which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4188
  second jhāna,
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4188
  which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4189
  With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4190
  With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna,
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4191 
  which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3927
  the wisdom group (paññākkhandha), made up of right view and right intention.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4169
  “And what, monks, is right view? Knowledge of suffering, knowledge of the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of suffering, knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: this is called right view.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4170
  “And what,monks, is right intention? Intention of renunciation, intention of non–ill will, intention of harmlessness: this is called right intention.
  (Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3920
  Contrary to a common assumption, the eight path factors are not steps to be followed in sequence, one after another. They are more appropriately described as components than as steps. Optimally, all eight factors should be present simultaneously, each making its own distinctive contribution, like eight interwoven strands of a cable that give the cable maximum strength.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3922
  However, until that stage is reached, it is inevitable that the factors of the path exhibit some degree of sequence in their development.

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3932
  In the Nikāyas, the Buddha often expounds the practice of the path as a gradual training (anupubbasikkhā) that unfolds in stages from the first step to the final goal. This gradual training is a finer subdivision of the threefold division of the path into moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3934
  Invariably in the suttas the exposition of the gradual training begins with the going forth into homelessness and the adoption of the lifestyle of a bhikkhu, a Buddhist monk. This immediately calls attention to the importance of the monastic life in the Buddha’s pragmatic vision.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3936
  In principle the entire practice of the Noble Eightfold Path is open to people from any mode of life, monastic or lay, and the Buddha confirms that many among his lay followers were accomplished in the Dhamma and had attained the first three of the four stages of awakening, up to nonreturning

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3938
  (an̄ḡm̄; Theravāda commentators say that lay followers can also attain the fourth stage, arahantship, but they do so either on the verge of death or after attainment immediately seek the going forth).

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3939
  The fact remains, however, that the household life inevitably fosters a multitude of mundane concerns and personal attachments that impede the single-hearted quest for liberation. Thus when the Buddha set out on his own noble quest he did so by going into homelessness,

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4269
  “A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: ‘Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the spiritual life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3941
  after his enlightenment, as a practical way to help others, he established the Saṅgha, the order of monks and nuns, for those who want to devote themselves fully to the Dhamma unhindered by the cares of household life.

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3943
  The gradual training occurs in two versions: a longer version in the Dīgha Nikāya and a middle-length version in the Majjhima Nikāya.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3944
  (1) the longer version has a more detailed treatment of the observances that pertain to monastic etiquette and ascetic self-restraint;

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3945
  (2) the longer version includes eight types of higher knowledge while the middle-length version has three types. However, as these three types are the ones mentioned in the Buddha’s account of his own enlightenment (see Text II,3(2)), they are by far the most important.

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3951
  The sequence opens with the appearance of a Tathāgata in the world and his exposition of the Dhamma. Having heard this, the disciple acquires faith and follows the Teacher into homelessness. He then undertakes the rules of discipline that promote the purification of conduct and the right livelihood of an ascetic.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4264
  “So too, brahmin, here a Tathāgata appears in the world,
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4268
  He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4269
  “A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: ‘Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the spiritual life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4274
  “Having thus gone forth and possessing the monk’s training and way of life, abandoning the destruction of life, he abstains from the destruction of life; with rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious, merciful, he dwells compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; taking only what is given, expecting only what is given, by not stealing he dwells in purity. Abandoning sexual relations, he observes celibacy, living apart, refraining from the coarse practice of sexual intercourse.
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4278
  “Abandoning false speech,

  Abandoning malicious speech,

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4282
  Abandoning harsh speech,
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4284
  Abandoning idle chatter,
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4286
  “He abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He eats only one meal a day, abstaining from eating at night and outside the proper time.10 He abstains from dancing, singing, music, and unsuitable shows. He abstains from wearing garlands, smartening himself with scent, and embellishing himself with unguents. He abstains from high and large couches. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He abstains from accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting raw meat. He abstains from accepting women and girls. He abstains from accepting men and women slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from accepting elephants, cattle, horses, and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and land. He abstains from going on errands and running messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from false weights, false metals, and false measures. He abstains from accepting bribes, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He abstains from wounding, murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and violence.
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3953
  The next three steps—contentment, restraint of the sense faculties, and mindfulness and clear comprehension—internalize the process of purification and thereby bridge the transition from moral discipline to concentration.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4294 
  “He becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these with him.
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4297
  Possessing this aggregate of noble moral discipline, he experiences within himself the bliss of blamelessness.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4298
  “On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its signs and features.11 Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of longing and dejection might invade him, he practices the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear ... On smelling an odor with the nose ... On tasting a flavor with the tongue … On feeling a tactile object with the body ... On cognizing a mental phenomenon with the mind, he does not grasp at its signs and features.
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4305
  “He becomes one who acts with clear comprehension when going forward and returning; who acts with clear comprehension when looking ahead and looking away; who acts with clear comprehension when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts with clear comprehension when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts with clear comprehension when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; who acts with clear comprehension when defecating and urinating; who acts with clear comprehension when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4309
  “Possessing this aggregate of noble moral discipline, and this noble restraint of the faculties, and possessing this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, he resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.
  (Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3954
  The section on the abandonment of the five hindrances deals with the preliminary training in concentration. The five hindrances—sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt—are the principal obstacles to meditative development, and thus they must be removed for the mind to become collected and unified.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4312
  “On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness before him. Abandoning longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; he purifies his mind from longing.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4314
  Abandoning ill will and hatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings;
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4316
  Abandoning dullness and drowsiness, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and clearly comprehending;
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4317
  Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he dwells free from agitation with a mind inwardly peaceful;
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4318
  Abandoning doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states;
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4319
  five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom,
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3960
  The next stage in the sequence describes the attainment of the jhānas, profound states of concentration in which the mind becomes fully absorbed in its object.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3961 
  The Buddha enumerates four jhānas, named simply after their numerical position in the series, each more refined and elevated than its predecessor.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4320
  first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4325
  second jhāna,
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4325
  which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4327
  “Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4331
  “Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection,
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4332
  fourth jhāna,
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4332
  which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3963
  Although wisdom rather than concentration is the critical factor in the attainment of enlightenment, the Buddha invariably includes the jhānas in the gradual training for at least two reasons: first, because they contribute to the intrinsic perfection of the path; and second, because the deep concentration they induce serves as a basis for the arising of insight.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3965
  The Buddha calls the jhānas the “footsteps of the Tathāgata” (MN 27.19–22) and shows them to be precursors of the bliss of Nibbāna that lies at the end of the training.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4326
  This too, brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathāgata … but a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened.…’
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3967
  From the fourth jhāna three alternative lines of further development become possible.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3968
  first line: four meditative states that continue the mental unification established by the jhānas. These states, described as “the liberations that are peaceful and formless,” are further refinements of concentration.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3969
  Distinguished from the jhānas by their transcendence of the subtle mental image that serves as the object in the jhānas, they are named the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3972
  A second line of development is the acquisition of supernormal knowledge.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3972
  The Buddha frequently refers to a set of six types,

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3973
  six kinds of direct knowledge

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3973
  The last of these, the knowledge of the destruction of the taints, is “supramundane” or world-transcending and thus marks the culmination of the third line of development. But the other five are all mundane, products of the extraordinarily powerful mental concentration achieved in the fourth jhāna:

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3975
  the supernormal powers, the divine ear, the ability to read the minds of others, the recollection of past lives, and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings

---

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3977 
  The jhānas and the formless attainments by themselves do not issue in enlightenment and liberation. Though lofty and peaceful, they can only silence the defilements that sustain the round of rebirths but cannot eradicate them.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3978
  To uproot the defilements at the most fundamental level, and thereby arrive at enlightenment and liberation, the meditative process must be directed to a third line of development. This is the contemplation of “things as they really are,” which results in increasingly deeper insights into the nature of existence and culminates in the final goal, the attainment of arahantship.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3981
  This line of development is the one the Buddha pursues in the passage on the gradual training.

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3982
  he prefaces it with descriptions of two of the direct knowledges,

* Highlight(pink) - Location 3982
  the recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings.

Highlight(pink) - Location 3983
collectively called the three true knowledges

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4334
  “When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4338
  ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I was reborn here.’
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4342
  “When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4344
  With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate.
  (Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)

* Highlight(pink) - Location 4345
  He understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus: ‘These beings who behaved wrongly by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook actions based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who behaved well by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook action based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’
