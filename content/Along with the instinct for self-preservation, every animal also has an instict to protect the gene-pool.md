## Along with the instinct for self-preservation, every animal also has an instict to protect the gene-pool

Of course, on top of the hard-wired [imprint](Imprint.md)ing of the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) comes “softer” [conditioning](Conditioning.md). This allows the safe-space perimeter to be generalized outward from the mother’s body to the pack or tribe—the “extended family.” Every social animal has, in addition to the Darwinian “instinct” (genetic program) of self-preservation, a similar “instinct” to protect the gene-pool. This is the basis of altruism, and social animals could not survive without it. Whereas the instinct for self-preservation involves [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md), this altrusitic mechanism can be characterised by [the three wholesome roots](The%20three%20wholesome%20roots.md).
