## Spaced repetition  # 

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the [[spacing effect]] and automate it for max efficiency. The basis for spaced repetition research was laid by [[Hermann Eddinghaus]], who suggested that information loss over time follows a [[forgetting curve]], but that forgetting could be prevented with repetition based on [[active recall]].

Spaced repetition of my notes automates the re-reading process, allowing me to stay engaged with my notes, and also ensures that consolidate these ideas into long-term memory. The spaced repetition stage is a continuation of the [[Digestion]] process. It also resembles the [[Digestion]] pattern. When i first start reviewing a note, my understanding of it is fragmented and unclear, or "formless and void," much like my [[Nebula]]s in the supernova stage. Over time, through the process of [[chunking]], the note more and more clear, "let there be light!". As it enters long-term memory, the "work" is "ended" and god(mind) rests.
