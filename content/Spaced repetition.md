## Spaced repetition

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the [spacing effect](Spacing%20effect.md) and automate it for max efficiency.

The basis for spaced repetition research was laid by [Hermann Eddinghaus](), who suggested that information loss over time follows a [forgetting curve](), but that forgetting could be prevented with repetition based on [active recall]().
