## A lot of the means of production stand idle because people can't get those jobs

Under the [capitalist](Capitalism.md) system, a portion of the [means of production](Means%20of%20production.md) stand idle, and there are many people who ask for work, but whom work is denied. Such workeres would gladly devote their work to things of value if given the opprotunity. Only a year of well-directed work by these workers would drastically increase the things produced by the [means of production](Means%20of%20production.md) which as of now remain idle. But those who would be happy to become hardy pioneers in so many branches of wealth-producing activity, must remain idle because the [bourgeois](Bourgeoisie.md) would rather invest their [capital](Capital.md) in foreign bonds.
