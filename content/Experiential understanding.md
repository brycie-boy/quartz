## Experiential understanding #‚è≥

Experiential understanding refers to the intuitive understanding of a concept through direct penetration of a it within ones immediate experience. To achieve direct penetration, one begins with correct [conceptual understanding](Conceptual%20understanding.md) ([Direct Insight cannot occur without having a conceptual framework to facilitate it](Direct%20Insight%20cannot%20occur%20without%20having%20a%20conceptual%20framework%20to%20facilitate%20it.md)), and by practice, transforms this understanding into direct penetration. 

Neurologically, It involves the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), as [the global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere](The%20global%20attention%20of%20the%20right%20hemisphere%20precedes%20the%20narrow%20attention%20of%20the%20left%20hemisphere.md), making it more in grounded in lived experience. Also, [the right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20able%20to%20integrate%20individual%20aspects%20of%20things%20into%20a%20coherent%20whole%20whereas%20the%20left%20sees%20only%20separate%20entities.md). Through experiential understanding, we go from an abstract and fragmentary understanding to understanding each of those parts wholistically and intuitively, all at once.
