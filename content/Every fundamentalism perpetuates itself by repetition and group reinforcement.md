## Every fundamentalism perpetuates itself by repetition and group reinforcement #🧠 

Every [[fundamentalism]] perpetuates itself by repetition. This is maintained half-consciously by group [[Operant conditioning|reinforcement]]. The signals that maintain the group-reality are repeated endlessly and cheerfully, while others are edited out by [[purity test]]s. 

For instance, many of us would be frequently annoyed by a news paper. News that we may not want to read could get printed. Nowadays, all of this can be avoided online. [[Data mining and personalized algorithms create an online experience that is increasingly tailored to our interests]].

When they get together in groups, this is aided by the aforementioned group reinforcement. People will box themselves s into [[echo chamber]]s wherein they tell each other how reasonable the group-reality is, and how wicked and perverse are all the alien groups with alternative group-realities.
