## Every fundamentalism perpetuates itself by repetition and group reinforcement #🧠

Every [fundamentalism](Fundamentalism.md) perpetuates itself by repetition. This is maintained half-consciously by group [reinforcement](Operant%20conditioning.md). The signals that maintain the group-reality are repeated endlessly and cheerfully, while others are edited out by [purity test](Purity%20test.md)s. 

For instance, many of us would be frequently annoyed by a news paper. News that we may not want to read could get printed. Nowadays, all of this can be avoided online. [Data mining and personalized algorithms create an online experience that is increasingly tailored to our interests](Data%20mining%20and%20personalized%20algorithms%20create%20an%20online%20experience%20that%20is%20increasingly%20tailored%20to%20our%20interests.md).

When they get together in groups, this is aided by the aforementioned group reinforcement. People will box themselves s into [echo chamber](Echo%20chamber.md)s wherein they tell each other how reasonable the group-reality is, and how wicked and perverse are all the alien groups with alternative group-realities.
