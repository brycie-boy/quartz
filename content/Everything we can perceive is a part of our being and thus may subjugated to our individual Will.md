## Everything we can perceive is a part of our being and thus may subjugated to our individual Will # 

Man is capable of being, and using, anything which they perceive; for everything that they perceive is in a certain sense a part of their being. They may thus subjugate the whole Universe of which he is conscious to their individual Will. Man has used the idea of God to dictate their personal conduct, to obtain power over their fellows, to excuse their crimes, and for innumerable other purposes, including that of realizing themselves as God. They have used the irrational and unreal conceptions of mathematics to help them in the construction of mechanical devices. They have used their moral force to influence the actions even of wild animals. They have employed poetic genius for political purposes.
