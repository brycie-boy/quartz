### Impressions

Unfortunately I‚Äôm dissatisfied with this book. This is because it did not go over the outcomes very much, which is what I‚Äôm more interested in. However, it had plenty to say about strategies for delaying gratification. The problem I had with these strategies is that they are all cognitive. Such as reappraisal and the like. He even advocates for distraction. None of these actually address the draw toward short-term reward. It‚Äôs still there. I am more fond of Dr. Judson brewers approach, which involves paying closer attention to the outcomes of our actions, and as a result developing a visceral disinclination toward harmful ones. This is based on experience rather than faith. What I wanted from this book was the outcomes of those who did and did not delay gratification in the marshmallow test, regardless of what method they used. I wanted notes on what happens to people who don‚Äôt delay gratification
