## Dopamine  #🧠 

Dopamine is a [[neurotransmitter]] involved in motivation, [[craving]], and exitement and is responsible for the outward manifestations of “seeking” behaviors. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the [[brain]]. Dopamine decreases the noise or static of undirected [[neuron]] chatter by preventing the receiving [[neuron]] from processing irrelevant signals.
