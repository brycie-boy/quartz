## Dopamine  #🧠



Dopamine is a [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) that is primarily involved in motivation, [craving](Craving.md), and exitement and is responsible for the outward manifestations of “seeking” behaviors. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the [brain](Brain.md). Dopamine decreases the noise or static of undirected [neuron](Neuron.md) chatter by preventing the receiving [neuron](Neuron.md) from processing irrelevant signals.
