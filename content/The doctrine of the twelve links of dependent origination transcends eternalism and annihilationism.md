## The doctrine of the twelve links of dependent origination transcends eternalism and annihilationism  #‚è≥

[The twelve links of Dependent Origination](The%20twelve%20links%20of%20Dependent%20Origination.md) are regarded as a "teaching by the middle" becuase it trandsends two radical views that polarize philosphical reflection on the human condition. These are [eternalism](Eternalism.md) and [annihilationism](Annihilationism.md). These extremes pose insuperable problems. [Eternalism](Eternalism.md) encourages obstanate [clinging](Clinging.md) to [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md). [Annihilationism](Annihilationism.md) threatens to undermine ethics and to make suffering a product of chance. [The twelve links of Dependent Origination](The%20twelve%20links%20of%20Dependent%20Origination.md) thereby offer a cogent explanation of the problem of suffering that one hand avoids the philosophical dilemmas of a permanent self, and on the other hand avoids the dangers of ethical anarchy to which [annihilationism](Annihilationism.md) eventually leads.
