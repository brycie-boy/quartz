## Privacy allows us to selectively reveal aspects of ourselves depending on the situation #üß†

We are not the same to everyone we know and meet. We act differently when we are with our families, our friends, our work colleagues, and so on. Its not necessarily that we're lying, although sometimes we do; its that we reveal different facets of ourselves to different people. Privacy is what allows us to act appropriately depending on the circumstances we may find ourselves in. In the privacy of our home or bedroom, we can relax in a way that we can't when someone else is around. Privacy is a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect. It's about choice and having the power to control how you present yourself to the world. When we lose our privacy, we lose control over how we present ourselves.
