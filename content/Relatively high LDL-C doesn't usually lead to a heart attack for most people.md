## Relatively high LDL-C doesn't usually lead to a heart attack for most people  # 

[[LDL-C]] emerged as a risk factor for [[heart attack]] from the Framingham Heart Study, an observational study in Massachusetts that started after World War II and continues today. The takeaway was that if you had very high [[LDL-C]] you were more likely to suffer a [[heart attack]]. But when the data were analyzed, unless [[LDL-C]] was very high (over 200), it wasn‚Äôt a risk factor. 

In fact, patients with really high [[LDL-C]] levels often have a [[gene]]tic disorder. Your [[LDL-C]] level is for the most part [[gene]]tically determined. Conversely, those with [[LDL-C]] levels less than 70 develop relatively little [[heart disease]]. Yes, there seems to be a [[gene]]tic protection at the low end, and risk at the high end. 

But for the rest of the population, [[LDL-C]] is not a great predictor of who will suffer a [[heart attack]]. It‚Äôs true that the HR ratio (hazard risk ratio; a measure of difference in risk versus the general population) of [[LDL-C]] is 1.3, which means that if your [[LDL-C]] is high, you have a 30 percent increase in risk for a [[heart attack]]. But correlation doesn‚Äôt mean causation. For example, if [[LDL-C]] is truly the bad boy of [[heart disease]], as the Medical Establishment says, then why, when you remove younger people from the analysis and just look at older people (greater than sixty years), do high [[LDL-C]] levels correlate with longevity? Maybe, once you factor out the people with [[gene]]tic reasons for high [[LDL-C]] (like those with [[gene]]tic disorders), then [[LDL-C]] isn‚Äôt really so bad. Or maybe [[modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it]].
