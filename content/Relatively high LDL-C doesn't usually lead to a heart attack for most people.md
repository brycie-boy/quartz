## Relatively high LDL-C doesn't usually lead to a heart attack for most people

[LDL-C](LDL-C.md) emerged as a risk factor for [heart attack]() from the Framingham Heart Study, an observational study in Massachusetts that started after World War II and continues today. The takeaway was that if you had very high [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) you were more likely to suffer a [heart attack](). But when the data were analyzed, unless [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) was very high (over 200), it wasn‚Äôt a risk factor. 

In fact, patients with really high [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) levels often have a [gene]()tic disorder. Your [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) level is for the most part [gene]()tically determined. Conversely, those with [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) levels less than 70 develop relatively little [heart disease](). Yes, there seems to be a [gene]()tic protection at the low end, and risk at the high end. 

But for the rest of the population, [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) is not a great predictor of who will suffer a [heart attack](). It‚Äôs true that the HR ratio (hazard risk ratio; a measure of difference in risk versus the general population) of [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) is 1.3, which means that if your [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) is high, you have a 30 percent increase in risk for a [heart attack](). But correlation doesn‚Äôt mean causation. For example, if [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) is truly the bad boy of [heart disease](), as the Medical Establishment says, then why, when you remove younger people from the analysis and just look at older people (greater than sixty years), do high [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) levels correlate with longevity? Maybe, once you factor out the people with [gene]()tic reasons for high [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) (like those with [gene]()tic disorders), then [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) isn‚Äôt really so bad. Or maybe [modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it](Modern%20medicine%20tends%20to%20target%20the%20pathology%20of%20an%20illness%20rather%20than%20preventing%20it.md).
