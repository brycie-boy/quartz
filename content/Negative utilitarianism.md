## Negative utilitarianism

Negative utilitarianism is a type of [consequentialism](Consequentialism.md) that can be described as the view that people should minimize the total amount of aggregate suffering, or that they should minimize suffering and then, secondarily, maximize the total amount of happiness. It can be considered as a version of [utilitarianism](Utilitarianism.md) that gives greater priority to reducing suffering (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing pleasure (positive utility).
