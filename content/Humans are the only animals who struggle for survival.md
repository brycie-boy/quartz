## Humans are the only animals who struggle for survival   # 

Most people have too much activation of the [[stress-fear-memory pathway]] and [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit|territorial circuit]] pugnacity for their own good. They are literally struggling for survival, as no other animals do, despite Darwin. Most animals simply play most of the time, solve problems of survival when they have to, or die of not solving the problems; only humans are conscious of struggling, and hence worried and depressed about the Game of Life.
