## Leap of Faith  #‚è≥

In the 19th century, philospher [S√∏ren Kierkegaard]() circled back to the pre [Thomas Aquinas]() era of Christianity and suggested that the way out of the perpetual relapse into uncertainty is a "leap of faith". His arguement was that all methods of seeking certitude have a concealed "leap of faith" in them, which their devotees conveniently "forget" or overlook. So Kierkegaard asks: why not admit that we are taking a "leap of faith?" The authour [Robert Anton Wilson]() proposes that there is a more reasonable alternative; namely to avoid the leap of faith and adopt a [model agnosticism](Model%20Agnosticism.md), although willing to learn from them in an open-minded way.
