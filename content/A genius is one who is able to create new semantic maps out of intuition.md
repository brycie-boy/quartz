## A genius is one who is able to create new semantic maps out of intuition # 

The [[left hemisphere]] builds all of its [[conditioning]] and learning onto a bedrock of hard-wired [[imprint]]ing. Thus, many existentially thinkable thoughts are socially unthinkable, since (a) everybody in a given society has roughly the same semantic [[imprint]] and (b) this is reinforced daily by assumptions that are mechanically taken for granted. Thus, a "genius" is one who, by some internal process, breaks through to the [[right hemisphere]]‚Äîa minor neurological miracle loosely called ‚Äúintuition‚Äù‚Äîand comes back down to the [[left hemisphere]] with the capacity to paint a new semantic map, build a new model of experience. Needless to say, this is always a profound shock to those still trapped in the old robot-[[imprint]]s.
