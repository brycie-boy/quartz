## A genius is one who is able to create new semantic maps out of intuition

The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) builds all of its [conditioning](Conditioning.md) and learning onto a bedrock of hard-wired [imprint](Imprint.md)ing. Thus, many existentially thinkable thoughts are socially unthinkable, since (a) everybody in a given society has roughly the same semantic [imprint](Imprint.md) and (b) this is reinforced daily by assumptions that are mechanically taken for granted. Thus, a "genius" is one who, by some internal process, breaks through to the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)—a minor neurological miracle loosely called “intuition”—and comes back down to the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) with the capacity to paint a new semantic map, build a new model of experience. Needless to say, this is always a profound shock to those still trapped in the old robot-[imprint](Imprint.md)s.
