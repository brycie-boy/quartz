## Unwholesome kamma  #‚è≥

Unwholesome [kamma](Kamma.md) is an action that is harmful to the agent, morally reprehensible, and brings painful fruits. It is [kamma](Kamma.md) that ripens into bad fortune and misery, or a "hellish experience". The criterion for judging [kamma](Kamma.md) as unwholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots"; these are [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md). Unwholesome Kamma manifests as one of [the ten pathways of unwholesome kamma](The%20ten%20pathways%20of%20wholesome%20and%20unwholesome%20kamma.md). Unwholesome kamma may be thought of as an attempt to dominate and control others. Thus it is in contrast with [non-forcing](Non-forcing.md).
