## Unwholesome kamma  #‚è≥ 

Unwholesome [[kamma]] is an action that is harmful to the agent, morally reprehensible, and brings painful fruits. It is [[kamma]] that ripens into bad fortune and misery, or a "hellish experience". The criterion for judging [[kamma]] as unwholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots"; these are [[the three unwholesome roots]]. Unwholesome Kamma manifests as one of [[the ten pathways of wholesome and unwholesome kamma|the ten pathways of unwholesome kamma]]. Unwholesome kamma may be thought of as an attempt to dominate and control others. Thus it is in contrast with [[non-forcing]].
