## Consciousness is created from metaphiers and their paraphiers projecting paraphrands in the functional sense # 

The poetry of [[paraphier]]s and [[paraphrand]]s is how consciousness is made. Suppose we are trying to solve a problem, And suppose we express the fact that we have obtained the solution by exclaiming that at last we ‘see’ what the answer is. This metaphor may be analyzed just as a blanket of snow or the singing brook. The [[metaphrand]] is obtaining the solution, the [[metaphier]] is sight with the eyes, and the [[paraphier]]s are all those things associated with vision that then create [[paraphrand]]s, such as the mind’s ‘eye’, ‘seeing the solution clearly’ etc., and, most important, the [[paraphrand]] of a ‘space’ in which the ‘seeing’ is going on, or what I am calling mind-space, and ‘objects’ to ‘see.’

Consciousness is the work of lexical metaphor. It is spun out of the concrete [[metaphier]]s of expression and their [[paraphier]]s, projecting [[paraphrand]]s that exist only in the functional sense. Moreover, it goes on generating itself, each new [[paraphrand]] capable of being a [[metaphrand]] on its own, resulting in new [[metaphier]]s with their [[paraphier]]s, and so on.

Of course this process is not and cannot be as haphazard as It sounds here. The world is organized, highly organized, and the concrete [[metaphier]]s that are generating consciousness thus generate consciousness in an organized way. Hence the similarity of consciousness and the physical-behavioral world we are conscious of. And hence the structure of that world is echoed—though with certain differences—in the structure of consciousness.
