## Consciousness is created from metaphiers and their paraphiers projecting paraphrands in the functional sense

The poetry of [paraphier](Paraphier.md)s and [paraphrand](Paraphrand.md)s is how consciousness is made. Suppose we are trying to solve a problem, And suppose we express the fact that we have obtained the solution by exclaiming that at last we ‘see’ what the answer is. This metaphor may be analyzed just as a blanket of snow or the singing brook. The [metaphrand](Metaphrand.md) is obtaining the solution, the [metaphier](Metaphier.md) is sight with the eyes, and the [paraphier](Paraphier.md)s are all those things associated with vision that then create [paraphrand](Paraphrand.md)s, such as the mind’s ‘eye’, ‘seeing the solution clearly’ etc., and, most important, the [paraphrand](Paraphrand.md) of a ‘space’ in which the ‘seeing’ is going on, or what I am calling mind-space, and ‘objects’ to ‘see.’

Consciousness is the work of lexical metaphor. It is spun out of the concrete [metaphier](Metaphier.md)s of expression and their [paraphier](Paraphier.md)s, projecting [paraphrand](Paraphrand.md)s that exist only in the functional sense. Moreover, it goes on generating itself, each new [paraphrand](Paraphrand.md) capable of being a [metaphrand](Metaphrand.md) on its own, resulting in new [metaphier](Metaphier.md)s with their [paraphier](Paraphier.md)s, and so on.

Of course this process is not and cannot be as haphazard as It sounds here. The world is organized, highly organized, and the concrete [metaphier](Metaphier.md)s that are generating consciousness thus generate consciousness in an organized way. Hence the similarity of consciousness and the physical-behavioral world we are conscious of. And hence the structure of that world is echoed—though with certain differences—in the structure of consciousness.
