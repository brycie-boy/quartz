## The establishments of mindfulness  #‚è≥

An establishment of [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) is defined as a mode of dwelling which involves the observation of objects in the proper state of mind. This state of mind consists of three positive qualities: diligence, [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md), and clear comprehension. The establishments of [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) are divided into four major sections containing a variety of exercises. These are:

* [contemplation of body](Contemplation%20of%20body.md)
* [contemplation of feeling](Contemplation%20of%20feeling.md)
* [contemplation of mind](Contemplation%20of%20mind.md)
* [contemplation of phenomena](Contemplation%20of%20phenomena.md)

Each exercise contains an auxiliary section with three subdivisions. The first states that the meditator contemplates the object internally (within their own experience), then externally (reflectivity considering it as occurring within the experience of others) to exercise right hemispheres ability to put ourselves in others shoes: [the right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20the%20ability%20to%20put%20ourselves%20in%20anothers%20shoes.md), and then both, ensuring that the meditator develops a balanced view of the object. The second portion states that the meditator contemplates the object as subject to origination and vanishing. This brings light to the characteristic of [impermanence](Impermanence.md) and thus leads to [insight](Insight.md) into [the three characteristics](The%20three%20characteristics.md). The third describes the meditator as dwelling in a state of complete detachment, not [clinging](Clinging.md) to anything in the world.
