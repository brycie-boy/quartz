## Appeal to majority  # 

Appeal to majority is a [[Fallacy]] which is based on claiming a truth because the majority thinks it is so. It uses an appeal to the beliefs, tastes, or values of a group of people, stating that because a certain opinion or attitude is held by a majority, it must be correct.
