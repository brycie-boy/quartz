## Insulin can be both good and bad for you

[Insulin](Insulin.md) is good for you in that it lowers [blood glucose]() to prevent microvascular disease—but is also bad for you in that it increases the [smooth muscle]() around the [coronary arteries]() or in the [kidney](), leading to narrowing, and more risk for a [heart attack]() or [kidney]() failure. [Insulin](Insulin.md) has two actions in [cell]()s: 1) metabolic (lowers glucose, stores energy); and 2) cell proliferation (meaning growth and division). Every insulin molecule your pancreas makes is both good and bad for you, all at the same time—short-term gain (blood-glucose lowering) for long-term pain (vascular dysfunction and cancer).

This dichotomous effect of [insulin](Insulin.md) has been seen in every intensive [blood glucose]() control study, such as the UK Prospective [Diabetes](Diabetes.md) Study (UKPDS), the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in [Diabetes](Diabetes.md) Study (ACCORD) on the effects of rosiglitazone, the Veterans Affairs [Diabetes](Diabetes.md) Trial (VADT), and the Action in [Diabetes](Diabetes.md) and Vascular Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE), which actually had to be stopped midstream because of the increase in patient mortality from large vessel disease ([heart disease]()). We need [insulin](Insulin.md) to survive, but if we are [insulin resistant](Insulin%20resistance.md), adding extra [insulin](Insulin.md) lowers [glucose]() only at the expense of contributing to chronic disease. Short-term gain for long-term pain.
