## We can find meaning in uncontrollable suffering by taking it as a challenge to triumph and change our attitudes

One way we can find meaning in life is through suffering. We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one‚Äôs predicament into a human achievement. When we're no longer able to change a situation‚Äîjust think of an incurable disease such as inoperable [cancer]()‚Äîwe are challenged to change ourselves. Additionally, [we can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives](We%20can%20use%20our%20stress%20as%20a%20navigational%20tool%20to%20help%20guide%20our%20lives.md). In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. It is one of the basic tenets of [logotherapy]() that man‚Äôs main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life (see [will to meaning](Will%20to%20meaning.md)). That is why people are even *ready* to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that their suffering has a meaning.
