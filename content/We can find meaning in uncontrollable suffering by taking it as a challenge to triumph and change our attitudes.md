## We can find meaning in uncontrollable suffering by taking it as a challenge to triumph and change our attitudes # 

One way we can find meaning in life is through suffering. We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one‚Äôs predicament into a human achievement. When we're no longer able to change a situation‚Äîjust think of an incurable disease such as inoperable [[cancer]]‚Äîwe are challenged to change ourselves. Additionally, [[we can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives]]. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice. It is one of the basic tenets of [[logotherapy]] that man‚Äôs main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in their life (see [[will to meaning]]). That is why people are even _ready_ to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that their suffering has a meaning.
