## The way we attend to something changes whatever that thing is to us #üß† 

Attention is not just another ‚Äòfunction‚Äô alongside other cognitive functions. Its ontological status is of something prior to functions and even to things. The kind of attention we bring to bear on the world changes the nature of the world we attend to, the very nature of the world in which those ‚Äòfunctions‚Äô would be carried out, and in which those ‚Äòthings‚Äô would exist. Attention changes what kind of a thing that comes into being for us. 

Anything that we come into contact with well seem different to us depending on the [[reality tunnel]] we apply to it, and yet nothing has changed objectively. The [[etic reality]] remains the same. Take an example from [[Robert Anton Wilson]]:

>  ‚ÄúStanley Laurel throws a pie which hits Oliver Hardy in the face. In the physicist's model or reality-tunnel (the two overlap in this case) the best description of what has happened is Newton's F equals ma (Force equals mass times acceleration). In the anthropological reality-tunnel, what has happened is a continuation of the Feast of Fools or Saturnalia or the tradition of the royal fool who is immune from the tabu against rebellion in comic form. To some Freudians, the best reality-tunnel is that the Son's rage against the Father is being expressed symbolically. To some Marxists, it is the worker's rage against the boss.‚Äù

There is no "real" interpretation which can be distinguished from another, no one way of thinking which reveals the true energy-event. No one [[reality tunnel]] could be said to be adequate for the description of all human experience, although some [[reality tunnel]]s are better in some contexts than others are. 

Science, however, purports to be uncovering the "real" event. Its apparently ‚Äúobjective‚Äù and value-free descriptions are assumed to deliver the truth about the energy-event, onto which our feelings and desires are later painted. Yet this highly objective stance is itself value-laden. It is just one particular way of looking at things, a way which privileges detachment and a lack of emotional commitment of the viewer to the object viewed. For some purposes this can be undeniably useful. But its use in such cases does not make it truer or more ‚Äúreal,‚Äù or closer to the true nature of things.

Attention is inescapably bound up with value‚Äîunlike what we conceive as ‚Äòcognitive functions‚Äô, which are neutral in this respect. Values enter through the way in which those functions are exercised: they can be used in different ways for different purposes to different ends. Attention is intrinsically is a way in which, not a thing: it is intrinsically a relationship, not a brute fact. It is a ‚Äòhowness‚Äô, a something between, an aspect of consciousness itself, not a ‚Äòwhatness‚Äô, a thing in itself, an object of consciousness. It brings into being a world and, with it, depending on its nature, a set of values.

If what it is that exists comes into being for each one of us through its interaction with our [[brain]]s and minds, then the idea that we could have an objective knowledge of it that was not also an expression of ourselves, and dependent on what we brought to the relationship, is untenable. Different aspects of the world come into being through the interaction of our [[brain]]s with our object, and precisely which aspects come into being depends on the nature of our attention.
