## There are overweight people without who are not sick

[Weight gain occurs after metabolic syndrome](Weight%20gain%20occurs%20after%20metabolic%20syndrome.md), but there are also 20 percent of people who are overweight but not sick. Because the [subcutaneous fat]() tissue can actually be protective, giving excess energy a nontoxic place to go. Just because they’re obese does not automatically mean that they harbor the egregious and deadly forms of fat in other [organ]()s where it shouldn’t be. Rather, it’s the [ectopic fat]() that determines if they’ll develop [diabetes](Diabetes.md) or [heart disease](). [Robert H. Lustig]() and colleuges have shown that fat in the [liver]() is the most predictive of whether someone will get [diabetes](Diabetes.md) in the future. Furthermore, nonalcoholic [fatty liver disease]() can lead to [cirrhosis]() (scarring of the [liver](), which is lethal), just as can happen in chronic alcoholics. Each of these conditions occurs in normal weight people, too! [Obesity]() is just another symptom of the problem ([Insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md)), not the problem itself. But [modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it](Modern%20medicine%20tends%20to%20target%20the%20pathology%20of%20an%20illness%20rather%20than%20preventing%20it.md).
