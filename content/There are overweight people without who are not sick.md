## There are overweight people without who are not sick  # 

[[Weight gain occurs after metabolic syndrome]], but there are also 20 percent of people who are overweight but not sick. Because the [[subcutaneous fat]] tissue can actually be protective, giving excess energy a nontoxic place to go. Just because they’re obese does not automatically mean that they harbor the egregious and deadly forms of fat in other [[organ]]s where it shouldn’t be. Rather, it’s the [[ectopic fat]] that determines if they’ll develop [[diabetes]] or [[heart disease]]. [[Robert H. Lustig]] and colleuges have shown that fat in the [[liver]] is the most predictive of whether someone will get [[diabetes]] in the future. Furthermore, nonalcoholic [[fatty liver disease]] can lead to [[cirrhosis]] (scarring of the [[liver]], which is lethal), just as can happen in chronic alcoholics. Each of these conditions occurs in normal weight people, too! [[Obesity]] is just another symptom of the problem ([[Insulin resistance]]), not the problem itself. But [[modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it]].
