## The eight circuits of consciousness  # 

Following Dr. [[Timothy Leary]], we shall divide [[the brains hardware and software]] into eight circuits. Four of the circuits are  "antique" and conservative, they exist in everybody. These are: 

- The Oral [[Limbic system]]
- The Anal [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]]
- The [[Time-BInding Semantic Circuit]]
- The Moral [[Socio-Sexual Circuit]]

The second group of four [[brain]] circuits is much newer, and each circuit exists at present only in minorities. Where the antique circuits recapitualate evolution-to-the-present, these futuristic circuits precapitulate our future evolutiion. These are: 

- The Holistic [[Neurosomatic Circuit]]
- The [[Meta-Programming Circuit]]
- [[The Collective Neurogenetic Circuit]]
- [[The Non-Local Quantum CIrcuit]]
