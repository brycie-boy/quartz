## Supernormal Powers

The Buddha refers to six types of supernormal knowledge he calls the ‚Äúsix types of direct knowledge‚Äù which are one of the lines of development that can be reached through [The fourth jhana](The%20fourth%20jhana.md). These are:

* [Remote viewing]()
* [Telepathy]()
* [Recollection of past lives]()
* the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings
* the knowledge of the distruction of [The taints](The%20taints.md)
