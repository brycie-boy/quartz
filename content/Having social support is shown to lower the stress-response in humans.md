## Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in humans

[Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in primates](Having%20social%20support%20is%20shown%20to%20lower%20the%20stress-response%20in%20primates.md), and social support is certainly protective for humans as well. This can be demonstrated even in transient instances of support. In a number of subtle studies, subjects were exposed to a [stressor](Stressor.md) such as having to give a public speech or perform a mental arithmetic task, or having two strangers argue with them, with or without a supportive friend present. In each case, social support translated into less of a cardiovascular [stress-response](Stress-response.md). 

Profound and persistent differences in degrees of social support can influence human physiology as well: within the same family, there are significantly higher [cortisol](Cortisol.md) levels among stepchildren than among biological children. Or, as another example, among women with metastatic breast cancer, the more social support, the lower the resting [cortisol](Cortisol.md) levels.
