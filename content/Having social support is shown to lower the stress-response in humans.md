## Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in humans # 

[[Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in primates]], and social support is certainly protective for humans as well. This can be demonstrated even in transient instances of support. In a number of subtle studies, subjects were exposed to a [[stressor]] such as having to give a public speech or perform a mental arithmetic task, or having two strangers argue with them, with or without a supportive friend present. In each case, social support translated into less of a cardiovascular [[stress-response]]. 

Profound and persistent differences in degrees of social support can influence human physiology as well: within the same family, there are significantly higher [[cortisol]] levels among stepchildren than among biological children. Or, as another example, among women with metastatic breast cancer, the more social support, the lower the resting [[cortisol]] levels.
