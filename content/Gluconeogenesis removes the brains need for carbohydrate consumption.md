## Gluconeogenesis removes the brains need for carbohydrate consumption

It is true that certain portions of the [brain](Brain.md) do require some [glucose](), but this [glucose]() does not have to come from your diet, it can come from the process of [gluconeogenesis](Gluconeogenesis.md). The rest of your [brain](Brain.md) can utilize [ketone](Ketone.md)s for fuel, and in fact, the [brain](Brain.md) likely prefers [ketone](Ketone.md)s. Since [ketones provide more energy to the brain than glucose](Ketones%20provide%20more%20energy%20to%20the%20brain%20than%20glucose.md), [ketone](Ketone.md)s are taken up via the [brain](Brain.md) in proportion to their availability in the blood. The [liver]() can produce between 100 and 150 grams of [ketone](Ketone.md)s per day, which is more than enough to meet the energy demands of the [brain](Brain.md). This means that the [brain](Brain.md) can derive all of the energy it needs from [ketone](Ketone.md)s and [gluconeogenesis](Gluconeogenesis.md), removing the need for carbohydrate consumption.
