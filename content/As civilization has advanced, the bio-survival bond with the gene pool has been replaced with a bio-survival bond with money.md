## As civilization has advanced, the bio-survival bond with the gene pool has been replaced with a bio-survival bond with money  # 

As civilization has advanced, the pack-bond (the tribe, the extended family) has been broken. This is the root of the widely diagnosed “anomie” or “alienation” or “existential anguish” about which so many social critics have written so eloquently. What has happened is that the [[conditioning]] of the bio-survival bond to the gene-pool has been replaced by a [[conditioning]] of bio-survival drives to hook onto the peculiar tickets which we call “money”. Concretely, a modern man or woman doesn’t look for biosurvival security in the gene-pool, the pack, the extended family. Bio-survival depends on getting the tickets. “You can’t live without money." If the tickets are withdrawn, acute bio-survival anxiety appears at once. Imagine, as vividly as possible, what you would feel, and what you would do, if all your sources to bio-survival tickets (money) were cut off tomorrow. This is precisely what tribal men and women feel if cut off from the tribe.
