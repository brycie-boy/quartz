## Ego

* The ego is a psychological mechanism involving a [identity view](Identity%20view.md)
* the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive functions
* judgment, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defense, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning, and memory
* Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety and allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal.
