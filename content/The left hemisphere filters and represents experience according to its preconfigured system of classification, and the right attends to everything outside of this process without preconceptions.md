## The left hemisphere filters and represents experience according to its preconfigured system of classification, and the right attends to everything outside of this process without preconceptions

[The kind of attention we pay to an object changes whatever that thing is to us](The%20kind%20of%20attention%20we%20pay%20to%20an%20object%20changes%20whatever%20that%20thing%20is%20to%20us.md), so If what it is that exists comes into being for each one of us through its interaction with our [brain](Brain.md)s and minds, then the idea that we could have a knowledge of it that was not also an expression of ourselves, and dependent on what we brought to the relationship, is untenable. It may seem obvious, though, that the task of the [brain](Brain.md)—what we have a [brain](Brain.md) for—is to put us in touch with whatever it is that exists apart from ourselves. But this conclusion is not quite as obviously right as it seems. Different aspects of the world come into being through the interaction of our [brain](Brain.md)s with whatever it is that exists apart from ourselves, and precisely which aspects come into being depends on the nature of our attention. 

It might turn out that for some purposes, those that involve making use of the world and manipulating it for our benefit, we need, in fact, to be quite selective about what we see. In other words we might need to know what is of use to us—but this might be very different from understanding in a broader sense, and certainly might require filtering out some aspects of experience (the duty of the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md)). But without experiencing whatever it is, we would have nothing on which to ground our knowledge, so we have to experience it at some stage; but in order to *know* it, we have to ‘process’ experience. We have to be able to recognize (‘re-cognize’) what we experience: to say this is a ‘such-and-such’, that is, it has certain qualities that enable me to place it in a category of things that I have experienced before and about which I have certain beliefs and feelings. This processing eventually becomes so automatic that we do not so much experience *the* world as we experience our *representation* of the world. The world is no longer ‘present’ to us, but ‘re-presented’, a virtual world, a copy that exists in conceptual form in the mind.

Much of our capacity to ‘use’ the world depends, not on an attempt to open ourselves as much as possible to apprehending whatever it is that exists apart from ourselves, but instead on apprehending whatever we have brought into being for myself, my representation of it. This is the remit of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), and would appear to require a selective, highly focussed attention. The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is ‘on the look out’. It has to be open to whatever it is that exists apart from ourselves, as much as possible without preconceptions, not just focusing on what it already knows, or is interested in ([the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md)). This requires a mode of attention that is broader and more flexible than that of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md).
