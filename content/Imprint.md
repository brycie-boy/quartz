## Imprint  #üß†

[The brain selects for the brain circuits that are most utilized throughout development](The%20brain%20selects%20for%20the%20brain%20circuits%20that%20are%20most%20utilized%20throughout%20development.md), and imprints are more or less hard wired programs which the [brain](Brain.md) is genetically designed to except only at certain points in these stages of development. These points are known as times of imprint vulnerability. 

In general, the primordial imprint can always over-rule any subsequent [conditioning](Conditioning.md) or [learning](). An imprint is a species of [brain software](The%20brains%20hardware%20and%20software.md) that has become built in hardware, being impressed on tender [neuron](Neuron.md)s when they are open and vulnerable. Imprints are non-negotiable aspects of our personality. Out of the infinity of possible programs existing as potential software, the imprint establishes the limits within which all subsequent [conditioning](Conditioning.md) occurs. Each successive imprint complicates the software which programs our experience and which we experience as "reality."

Before the first imprint, the [consciousness](Consciousness.md) of the infant is ‚Äúformless and void‚Äù‚Äîlike the Universe at the beginning of Genesis, or the descriptions of unconditioned [consciousness](Consciousness.md) ([Nibbana](Nibbana.md)) in the [mystic](Mysticism.md) traditions. As soon as the first imprint is made, structure emerges out of the creative void. The growing mind, alas, becomes trapped within this structure. It identifies with the structure, and in a sense it becomes the structure. [Conditioning](Conditioning.md) and learning build further networks onto this bedrock of imprinted software. The total structure of this [brain](Brain.md)-circuitry makes up our map of the world. It is what our Thinker thinks, and our Prover mechanically fits all incoming signals to the limitations of this map ([What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves](What%20the%20Thinker%20thinks,%20the%20Prover%20proves.md)).
