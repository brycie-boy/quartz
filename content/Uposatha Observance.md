## Uposatha Observance #‚è≥ 

There is a more stringent moral discipline 
that lay Buddhists undertake for the Uposatha, the observance days determined by the lunar calendar: the full-moon day, the new-moon day, and the two half-moon days. Of the four, it is the full-moon day that is given priotity. On these occasions, devout lay Buddhists undertake eight precepts, The additional precepts emulate the training of a novince monk or nun. Other than  [[the five precepts]], these include:

- Complete sexual abstinace
- One meal a day, refraining from eating at night
- Abstinince of entertainment, including dancing, singing, music, shows, wearing jewelry, and using collogne
- Abstaining from using luxurious furniture, instead using low resting places, such as small beds or mats
