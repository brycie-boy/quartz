## Neural activity changes in accordance with mental activity

When your mind changes, your [brain](Brain.md) changes, too. In the saying from the work of the psychologist [Donald Hebb](): when [neuron](Neuron.md)s fire together, they wire together‚Äîmental activity actually creates new neural structures ([Synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened through life experiences and frequency of use](Synaptic%20connections%20are%20strengthened%20or%20weakened%20through%20life%20experiences%20and%20frequency%20of%20use.md)). "Mind" and"body" are not two seperate things, but are a [mind-body](Mind-body.md) unity. As a result, even fleeting thoughts and feelings can leave lasting marks on your [brain](Brain.md), much like a spring shower can leave little trails on a hillside. 

Conscious mental events are based on temporary coalitions of [synapse](Synapse.md)s that form and disperse‚Äîusually within seconds‚Äîlike eddies in a stream. [Neuron](Neuron.md)s can also make lasting circuits, strengthening their connections to each other as a result of mental activity. For example, taxi drivers in London‚Äîwhose job requires remembering lots of twisty streets‚Äîdevelop a larger [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md). As you become a happier person, the left frontal region of your [brain](Brain.md) becomes more active. 

What flows through your mind sculpts your [brain](Brain.md). Thus, you can use your mind to change your [brain](Brain.md) for the better. The mind and [brain](Brain.md) interact with each other so profoundly that they‚Äôre best understood as a single, co-dependent, mind/[brain](Brain.md) system. Ignorace of this is due to the mind-body [dualism]() which has coloured Western thinking from [Plato]() onwards, in which the immaterial and material aspects of the universe were thought of as separate and incompatible.
