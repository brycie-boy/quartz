## Glucagon

Glucagon is a [hormone]() released by the [pancreas]() when we have low levels of [blood glucose]() and [insulin](Insulin.md), which occurs when [carbohydrate](Carbohydrate.md) intake is decreased enough. Glucagon interacts with our [adipose tissue]() or [fat]() [cell]()s to release stored [fat]() into our bloodstream where it can be used by [cell]()s for energy.
