## Glucocorticoids can alter the features of neurotransmitter systems and make them less effective #üß†

The fact that [people with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response](People%20with%20depression%20generally%20have%20higher%20levels%20of%20glucocorticoids%20due%20to%20an%20overactive%20stress-response.md) is fitting in that the [hormone]()s can alter features of all three [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) systems of the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md)‚Äîthe amount of [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) synthesized, how fast it is broken down, how many [receptor](Receptor.md)s there are for each [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md), how well the [receptor](Receptor.md)s work, and so on. Moreover, stress has been shown to cause many of the same changes as well. Although [cortisol spikes are accompanied by increased dopamine levels in the brain](Cortisol%20spikes%20are%20accompanied%20by%20increased%20dopamine%20levels%20in%20the%20brain.md), sustained stress will eventually deplete [dopamine](Dopamine.md) from the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md), and [norepinephrine](Norepinephrine.md) from alerting the [locus ceruleus](). Moreover, stress alters all sorts of aspects of the synthesis, release, efficacy, and breakdown of [serotonin](Serotonin.md). Also, [excessive cortisol release has been shown to down-regulate serotonin-1a receptors](Excessive%20cortisol%20release%20has%20been%20shown%20to%20down-regulate%20serotonin-1a%20receptors.md). It is likely that whatever neurochemical abnormalities wind up being shown definitively link to [depression](Depression.md), there is precedent for stress and [glucocorticoid]()s causing those same abnormalities.
