## Glucocorticoids can alter the features of neurotransmitter systems and make them less effective # 

The fact that [[people with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response]] is fitting in that the [[hormone]]s can alter features of all three [[neurotransmitter]] systems of the [[limbic system]]‚Äîthe amount of [[neurotransmitter]] synthesized, how fast it is broken down, how many [[receptor]]s there are for each [[neurotransmitter]], how well the [[receptor]]s work, and so on. Moreover, stress has been shown to cause many of the same changes as well. Although [[Amygdala activity triggers the VTA to release dopamine]], sustained stress will eventually deplete [[dopamine]] from the [[mesolimbic pathway]], and [[norepinephrine]] from alerting the [[locus ceruleus]]. Moreover, stress alters all sorts of aspects of the synthesis, release, efficacy, and breakdown of [[serotonin]]. Also, [[excessive cortisol release has been shown to down-regulate serotonin-1a receptors]]. It is likely that whatever neurochemical abnormalities wind up being shown definitively link to [[depression]], there is precedent for stress and [[glucocorticoid]]s causing those same abnormalities.
