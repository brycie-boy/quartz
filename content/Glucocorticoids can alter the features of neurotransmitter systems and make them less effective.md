## Glucocorticoids can alter the features of neurotransmitter systems and make them less effective

The fact that [people with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response](People%20with%20depression%20generally%20have%20higher%20levels%20of%20glucocorticoids%20due%20to%20an%20overactive%20stress-response.md) is fitting in that the [hormone]()s can alter features of all three [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) systems‚Äîthe amount of [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) synthesized, how fast it is broken down, how many [receptor](Receptor.md)s there are for each [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md), how well the [receptor](Receptor.md)s work, and so on. Moreover, stress has been shown to cause many of the same changes as well. Although [Cortisol spikes are accompanied by increased dopamine levels in the brain](Cortisol%20spikes%20are%20accompanied%20by%20increased%20dopamine%20levels%20in%20the%20brain.md), sustained stress will eventually deplete [dopamine](Dopamine.md) from the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md), and [norepinephrine](Norepinephrine.md) from that alerting [locus ceruleus]() part of the [brain](Brain.md). Moreover, stress alters all sorts of aspects of the synthesis, release, efficacy, and breakdown of [serotonin](Serotonin.md). It is not clear which of those stress effects are most important, simply because it is not clear which [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) or [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s are most important. However, it is probably safe to say that whatever neurochemical abnormalities wind up being shown definitively to underlie [depression](Depression.md), there is precedent for stress and [glucocorticoid]()s causing those same abnormalities.
