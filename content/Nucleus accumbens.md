## Nucleus accumbens  #üß†

The [nucleus]() accumbens plays a significant role in the cognitive processing of [craving](Craving.md),¬†reward, and¬†[operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md), hence it also plays a significant role in¬†[addiction](Addiction.md). The motivation for reward is experienced when the [dopamine](Dopamine.md) from the [ventral tegmental area](Ventral%20tegmental%20area.md) reaches the [nucleus]() accumbens. The [nucleus]() accumbens is also a ‚Äúlearning‚Äù pathway‚Äîlearning what feels good. Upon consummation, those [neuron](Neuron.md)s then release [opioid peptide](Opioid%20peptide.md)s, which generate the feeling of [pleasure](Pleasure.md) or bliss.
