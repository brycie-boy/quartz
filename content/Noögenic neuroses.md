## No√∂genic neuroses

[Existential frustration](Existential%20frustration.md) can also result in [neuroses](). For this type of [neuroses]() [logotherapy]() has coined the term ‚Äú[no√∂genic neuroses](No%C3%B6genic%20neuroses.md)‚Äù in contrast to [neuroses]() in the traditional sense of the word, i.e., [psychogenic neuroses](). No√∂genic [neuroses]() have their origin not in the psychological but rather in the ‚Äúno√∂logical‚Äù (from the Greek no√∂s meaning mind) dimension of human existence. This is another [logotherapeutic]() term which denotes anything pertaining to the specifically human dimension.

No√∂genic [neuroses]() do not emerge from conflicts between drives and instincts but rather from existential problems. Among such problems, the frustration of the [will to meaning](Will%20to%20meaning.md) plays a large role. It is obvious that in no√∂genic cases the appropriate and adequate therapy is not psychotherapy in general but rather [logotherapy](); a therapy, that is, which dares to enter the specifically human dimension.
