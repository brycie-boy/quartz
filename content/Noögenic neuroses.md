## No√∂genic neuroses # 

[[Existential frustration]] can also result in [[neurosis|neuroses]]. For this type of [[neurosis|neuroses]] [[logotherapy]] has coined the term ‚Äú[[no√∂genic neuroses]]‚Äù in contrast to [[neurosis|neuroses]] in the traditional sense of the word, i.e., [[psychogenic neuroses]]. No√∂genic [[neurosis|neuroses]] have their origin not in the psychological but rather in the ‚Äúno√∂logical‚Äù (from the Greek no√∂s meaning mind) dimension of human existence. This is another [[logotherapy|logotherapeutic]] term which denotes anything pertaining to the specifically human dimension.

No√∂genic [[neurosis|neuroses]] do not emerge from conflicts between drives and instincts but rather from existential problems. Among such problems, the frustration of the [[will to meaning]] plays a large role. It is obvious that in no√∂genic cases the appropriate and adequate therapy is not psychotherapy in general but rather [[logotherapy]]; a therapy, that is, which dares to enter the specifically human dimension.
