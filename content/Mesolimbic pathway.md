The mesolimbic pathway is a part of the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) and is made up of [neuron](Neuron.md)s that synthesize the [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) [dopamine](Dopamine.md) in a primitive [nucleus]() in the [midbrain]() known as the [ventral tegmental area](Ventral%20tegmental%20area.md). When [neuron](Neuron.md)s in the [ventral tegmental area](Ventral%20tegmental%20area.md) fire, they send their [dopamine](Dopamine.md) to another [brain](Brain.md) area called the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) to generate the feelings of motivation that attend reward. It also facilitates [operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md).  A trigger associated with a previously pleasurable experience triggers a surge of [dopamine](Dopamine.md) in the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) and incites consummatory behavior.
