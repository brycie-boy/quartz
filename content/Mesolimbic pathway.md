## Mesolimbic pathway  #🧠 

![[68CB189A-B17C-46FB-97F0-2B6419AF3472.jpeg|500]]

The mesolimbic pathway is a part of the [[limbic system]] and is made up of [[neuron]]s that synthesize the [[neurotransmitter]] [[dopamine]] in a primitive [[nucleus]] in the [[midbrain]] known as the [[ventral tegmental area]]. When [[neuron]]s in the [[ventral tegmental area]] fire, they send their [[dopamine]] to another [[brain]] area called the [[nucleus accumbens]] to generate the feelings of motivation that attend reward. It also facilitates [[operant conditioning]].  A trigger associated with a previously pleasurable experience triggers a surge of [[dopamine]] in the [[nucleus accumbens]] and incites consummatory behavior.
