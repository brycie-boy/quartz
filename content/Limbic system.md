## Limbic system  #üß†

The limbic system is a structure in the [brain](Brain.md) involved in motivation, [craving](Craving.md), emotion, learning, and memory. This structure involves three major pathways that send and receive chemical information that is translated into positive and negative emotions. The first two include the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) and the [stress-fear-memory pathway](Stress-fear-memory%20pathway.md) which are responsible for the [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md). The third is the [serotonergic pathway](Serotonergic%20pathway.md). The interplay between these three distinct pathways dictates both the perception of emotion and the resultant behavioral responses.
