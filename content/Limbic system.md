## Limbic system  #🧠 

The limbic system is a structure in the [[brain]] involved in motivation, [[craving]], emotion, learning, and memory. This structure involves three major pathways that send and receive chemical information that is translated into positive and negative emotions. The first two include the [[mesolimbic pathway]] and the [[stress-fear-memory pathway]] which are responsible for the [[the three unwholesome roots]]. The third is the [[serotonergic pathway]]. The interplay between these three distinct pathways dictates both the perception of emotion and the resulting behavioral responses.
