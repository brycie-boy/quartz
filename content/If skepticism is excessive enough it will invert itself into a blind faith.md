## If skepticism is excessive enough it will invert itself into a blind faith  #üß†

Skepticism can turn into a blind faith when taken to its extreme. Every dogmatic [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) faith produces around itself a layer of doubt, denial, and outright skepticism of rival faiths. Every faith and every acceptance creates necessary doubt or rejection of things outside of that faith. Every [idol](Idol.md) is jealous of other [Idol](Idol.md)s. Less obviously, the extreme skeptic has their own blind faith, a psychological stocoma that is unconscious and therefor unacknowledged. To deny dogmatically is to say something is impossible. But to assert this is to claim, tacitly, that you already know the full range of the possible. The only escape from this trap is to adopt a [model agnosticism](Model%20Agnosticism.md).
