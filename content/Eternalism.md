## Eternalism  #⏳

Eternal ism is a philosophical view that proposes the existence of an eternal component of the individual, or an eternal ground or essence of the universe. It is referred to in Buddhism as the view of existence. The teaching of [the twelve links of Dependent Origination](The%20twelve%20links%20of%20Dependent%20Origination.md) avoids this position.
