## Capitalism needs people who can quickly jump from one identity to the next

[Capitalism destroys sources of stable identity so that it can market new ones](Capitalism%20destroys%20sources%20of%20stable%20identity%20so%20that%20it%20can%20market%20new%20ones.md), and we are constantly being scrambled, deidentified and made to feel isolated, and thus better subjects to be sold new identities and new relations. Consumer [capitalism](Capitalism.md) needs subjects who continually reenact the infantile drama of [mirror stage]() identifications. These subjects must oscillate quickly between [schizophrenic]() consciousness and idealized [ego](Ego.md) formations. Capitalism needs [schizophrenia](), but it also needs [ego](Ego.md)s. The contradiction is resolved through the acceleration of the rhythm of late capitalist visual culture. The more [capitalism](Capitalism.md) wants us to feel scrambled so that we're isolated, automatonized, and susceptible to replacing our own needs with the needs of [capital](Capital.md), the more quickly [capitalism](Capitalism.md) needs to sell us an ever-wider array of identities to feel secure and logical within.
