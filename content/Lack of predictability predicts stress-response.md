## Lack of predictability predicts stress-response

* [A lack of predictability as to when a stressor will occur has been shown to increase chronic stress](A%20lack%20of%20predictability%20as%20to%20when%20a%20stressor%20will%20occur%20has%20been%20shown%20to%20increase%20chronic%20stress.md)
* [Receiving a reward at an unpredictable time interval creates a stronger stress response than when it is received predictably](Receiving%20a%20reward%20at%20an%20unpredictable%20time%20interval%20creates%20a%20stronger%20stress%20response%20than%20when%20it%20is%20received%20predictably.md)
* [Organisms will habituate to stressors that are experienced predictably](Organisms%20will%20habituate%20to%20stressors%20that%20are%20experienced%20predictably.md)
* [Unpredictability can cause a higher stress response than if conditions were more stressful overall but still consistent](Unpredictability%20can%20cause%20a%20higher%20stress%20response%20than%20if%20conditions%20were%20more%20stressful%20overall%20but%20still%20consistent.md)
