## Childhood development plays a strong role in the development of mental illness and addiction

[Brain](Brain.md) development in the [uterus]() and during childhood is the single most important biological factor in determining whether or not a person will be predisposed to substance dependence and to [addictive](Addiction.md) behaviors of any sort, whether drug-related or not. Startling as this view may appear to be at first sight, it is amply supported by recent research. Dr. [Vincent Felitti]() was chief investigator in a landmark study of over seventeen thousand middle-class Americans for Kaiser Permanente and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. “The basic cause of [addiction](Addiction.md) is predominantly experience-dependent during childhood, and not substance-dependent,” Dr. Felitti has written. “The current concept of [addiction](Addiction.md) is ill-founded.”
