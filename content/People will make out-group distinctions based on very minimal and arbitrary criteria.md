## People will make out-group distinctions based on very minimal and arbitrary criteria

[Our brains make us-them distinctions extremely quickly](Our%20brains%20make%20us-them%20distinctions%20extremely%20quickly.md). Similarly, consider ‚Äúminimal group‚Äù paradigms, pioneered in the 1970s by [Henri Tajfel]() of the University of Bristol. He showed that even if groupings are based on flimsy differences (e.g., whether someone over or underestimated the number of dots in a picture), [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) biases, such as higher levels of cooperation, still soon develop. Such prosociality is about group identification‚Äîpeople preferentially allocate resources to anonymous [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) individuals. Merely grouping people activates parochial biases, no matter how tenuous the basis of the grouping. In general, minimal group paradigms enhance our opinion of Us rather than lessening our opinion of Them.
