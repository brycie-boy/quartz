## Addictions are rooted in efforts to avoid or prevent unpleasant feelings or memories  # 

When Dr. [[Judson Brewer]]s patients would tell him their stories of becoming addicted, he noticed a common theme. It was as if his patients had been one of the rats in [[B. F. Skinner]]s [[operant conditioning]] experiments and were describing the [[operant conditioning]] process that they had gone through: "i would have a flashback to some truamatic event" (trigger), "get drunk" (behavior), "and this was better than reliving the experience" (reward). He could line up the habit loop in their heads. Trigger, behavior, reward, repeat. The patients used these substances as a way to "medicate," by being high or drunk, they could avoid unpleasant memories or [[feeling]]s or prevent them from arising, or not remember afterword wether those memories had surfaced or not. They described their [[operant conditioning]] as a way to avoid situations, numb their pain, mask their unpleasant feelings, or just to relieve their [[craving]]s. 

- Someone says the wrong thing‚Äîor she believes they do. Her OFC, unconsciously primed to recall the many times she has been attacked, insulted, and injured, interprets this stimulus as a serious aggression.
