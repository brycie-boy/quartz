## Master morality  # 

Master morality is the type of ethics of the ruling class and involves [[friendly strength]] and [[hostile strength]] types. Master morality establishes itself as good and their own actions as good in contrast to all the low, low-minded, common and plebeian. Master morality values qualities such as power, strength, beauty, happiness. [[Hostile Strength]] is the embodiment of Nietzsche’s “Blond Beast,” the primitive conqueror-pirate type we find at the dawn of every civilization. This is what Nietzsche also called the “animal” or “unsublimated" form of the [[Will to Power]].

- every noble morality develops from a triumphant affirmation of itself
- it acts and grows spontaneously
- it seeks its opposite only so as to affirm itself more gratefully and triumphantly—its negative concept “low,” “common,” “bad” is only a subsequently-invented pale, contrasting image in relation to its positive basic concept—filled with life and passion through and through
