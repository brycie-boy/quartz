## Master morality

Master morality is the type of ethics of the ruling class and involves [friendly strength](Friendly%20strength.md) and [hostile strength](Hostile%20strength.md) types. Indeed, [Hostile Strength](Hostile%20strength.md) is the embodiment of Nietzsche’s “Blond Beast,” the primitive conqueror-pirate type we find at the dawn of every civilization. This is what Nietzsche also called the “animal” or “unsublimated" form of the Will to Power.
