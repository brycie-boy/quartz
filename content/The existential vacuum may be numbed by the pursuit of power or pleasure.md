## The existential vacuum may be numbed by the pursuit of power or pleasure # 

There are various masks and guises under which the [[existential vacuum]] appears. Sometimes the frustrated [[will to meaning]] is vicariously compensated for by a [[will to power]], including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of frustrated will to meaning is taken by the [[will to pleasure]]. That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual [[libido]] becomes rampant in the [[existential vacuum]].
