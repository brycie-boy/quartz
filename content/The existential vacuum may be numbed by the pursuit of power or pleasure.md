## The existential vacuum may be numbed by the pursuit of power or pleasure

There are various masks and guises under which the [existential vacuum](Existential%20vacuum.md) appears. Sometimes the frustrated [will to meaning](Will%20to%20meaning.md) is vicariously compensated for by a [will to power](), including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of frustrated will to meaning is taken by the [will to pleasure](). That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual [libido]() becomes rampant in the [existential vacuum](Existential%20vacuum.md).
