## We should take a model agnostic perspective towards mental disorders # 

[[Some people believe psychiatry can find the true essence of mental disorders]], and [[some people take mental disorders to be restrictive myths that do not exist at all]]. Another perspective on psychiatry is [[Model Agnosticism|model agnostic]]. [[Mental disorder]]s are not real diseases as the first perspective might wish; but neither are they the dangerous myths feared by the other perspective. They only focus on what works best‚Äînot distracted by biological [[reductionism]] or [[rationalism|rationalist]] doubt. They recognize that [[each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty]], and accept that we are constantly constructing perceptions and finding temporary explanations that are useful, but never completely accurate. Our classification of [[mental disorder]]s is no more than a collection of fallible and limited constructs that seeks but never fully finds the truth‚Äîbut remains our best current way of communicating about, treating, and researching [[mental disorder]]s.

[[Schizophrenia]] is a useful construct‚Äînot myth, not disease. It is a description of a particular set of psychological problems, not an explanation of their cause. Someday we will have a much more accurate understanding and more precise ways of describing these same problems. But for now, [[schizophrenia]] is very valuable in our day-to-day work. And so are the other [[DSM]] disorders. It is good to know and use the [[DSM]] definitions, but not to [[Reification|reify]] or worship them.
