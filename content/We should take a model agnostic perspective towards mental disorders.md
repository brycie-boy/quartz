## We should take a model agnostic perspective towards mental disorders

[Some people believe psychiatry can find the true essence of mental disorders](Some%20people%20believe%20psychiatry%20can%20find%20the%20true%20essence%20of%20mental%20disorders.md), and [some people take mental disorders to be restrictive myths that do not exist at all](Some%20people%20take%20mental%20disorders%20to%20be%20restrictive%20myths%20that%20do%20not%20exist%20at%20all.md). Another perspective on psychiatry is [model agnostic](Model%20Agnosticism.md). [Mental disorder]()s are not real diseases as the first perspective might wish; but neither are they the dangerous myths feared by the other perspective. They only focus on what works best‚Äînot distracted by biological [reductionism](Reductionism.md) or [rationalist]() doubt. They recognize that [each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty](Each%20perception%20that%20we%20make%20is%20best%20considered%20to%20be%20a%20gamble%20rather%20than%20a%20certainty.md), and accept that we are constantly constructing perceptions and finding temporary explanations that are useful, but never completely accurate. Our classification of [mental disorder]()s is no more than a collection of fallible and limited constructs that seeks but never fully finds the truth‚Äîbut remains our best current way of communicating about, treating, and researching [mental disorder]()s.

[Schizophrenia]() is a useful construct‚Äînot myth, not disease. It is a description of a particular set of psychological problems, not an explanation of their cause. Someday we will have a much more accurate understanding and more precise ways of describing these same problems. But for now, [schizophrenia]() is very valuable in our day-to-day work. And so are the other [DSM]() disorders. It is good to know and use the [DSM]() definitions, but not to [reify](Reification.md) or worship them.
