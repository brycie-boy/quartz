## Cognitive methods for self-control are based on faith

[Mindfulness can allow us to get over bad habits without cognitive effort](Mindfulness%20can%20allow%20us%20to%20get%20over%20bad%20habits%20without%20cognitive%20effort.md). Those who rely on cognitive methods for self-control have to rely on faith. Namely in faith in an abstract [conceptual understanding](Conceptual%20understanding.md) that the outcomes of a certain behavior are negative, rather than the direct experience of those outcomes. 

* what experts or society have told you is bad
* This is especially dangerous when it is used to enforce norms

If they truly believed that a behavior was a harmful one, then they would have no motivation to do it in the first place, and thus no need for inhibition or reappraisal techniques.
