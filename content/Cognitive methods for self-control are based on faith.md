Namely in faith in an abstract [[conceptual understanding]] that the outcomes of a certain behavior are negative, rather than the direct experience of those outcomes. 

- what experts or society have told you is bad

If they truly believed that a behavior was a harmful one, then they would have no motivation to do it in the first place, and thus no need for inhibition or reappraisal techniques.
