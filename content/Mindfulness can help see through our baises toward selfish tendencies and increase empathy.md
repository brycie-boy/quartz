## Mindfulness can help see through our baises toward selfish tendencies and increase empathy

Through out our lives we may learn ethical values that are based on (and [subjectively biased](Subjective%20bias.md) toward) cultural and situational norms. By appealing to ethical judgments that all members of our human moral community would make if they were alert and unbiased, we can make sense of the idea that individuals and groups sometimes get the normative truth wrong, and that we sometimes get it right. Being able to see our [subjective bias](Subjective%20bias.md)es, which are born from our previous reactions, may be enough to help us learn a common human ethic.

The development of awareness entails a fundamental realignment of one‚Äôs sensitivity to the feelings, needs, longings and fears of others. Thus, [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) means empathizing with the condition and plight of others as revealed through an enhanced ‚Äòreading‚Äô of their bodies. This clarity is important for disrupting innate tendencies of selfishness, which in turn contributes to letting go of self-interested reactivity. If we can take off our blur-inducing glasses of self-focus and [subjective bias](Subjective%20bias.md), which lead us to [habit](Habit.md)ually react to the world through fear, anger, and so forth, we will be able to see the results of our actions more clearly (by getting a better read from others‚Äô body language), and we may respond more skillfully to each moment‚Äôs unique circumstances.
