## Clinging  #🧠 

In Buddhism, clinging is defined as a tight attachment or identification with objects of desire through sensuality and [[Ignorance]]. [[The Nikayas]] list four types of clinging: clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of self. The cause and condition for the manifestation of clinging is [[craving]]. Neurologically, clinging is associated with the [[posterior cingulate cortex]]. And most likely the left one, as [[the right hemisphere is better at dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis]].
