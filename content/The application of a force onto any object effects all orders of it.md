## The application of a force onto any object effects all orders of it

If we take into consideration the principle of  [Dependent Origination](Dependent%20Origination.md), the application of any given force affects all the orders of being which exist in the object to which it is¬†applied, whichever of those orders is directly affected. If I strike a man with a dagger, his consciousness, not his body only, is affected by my act; although the dagger, as such, has no direct relation therewith. Similarly, the power of my thought may so work on the mind of another person as to produce far-reaching physical changes in him, or in others through him
