## Mindfulness has been shown to improve cognitive inhibition # 

There is evidence that [[meditation]] can improve [[cognitive inhibition]]. Undergrads volunteered to try ten-minute sessions of either focusing on counting their breath or an apt comparison task: browsing Huffington Post, Snapchat, or BuzzFeed. Just three ten-minute sessions of breath counting was enough to appreciably increase their attention skills on a battery of tests. And the biggest gains were among the heavy multitaskers, who did more poorly on those tests initially, as [[multitasking can worsen cognitive inhibition]].

Even beginners in [[meditation]] can sharpen their attention skills, with some surprising benefits. For instance, researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara gave volunteers an eight-minute instruction of [[mindfulness]] of their breath, and found that this short focusing session (compared to reading a newspaper or just relaxing) lessened how much their mind wandered afterward. 

While that finding is of interest, the follow-up was even more compelling. The same researchers gave volunteers a two-week course in [[mindfulness]] of breathing, as well as of daily activities like eating, for a total of six hours, plus ten-minute booster sessions at home daily. The active control group studied nutrition for the same amount of time. Again, [[mindfulness]] improved concentration and lessened mind-wandering.
