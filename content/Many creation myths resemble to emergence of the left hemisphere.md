## Many creation myths resemble to emergence of the left hemisphere  # 

The emergence of the [[left hemisphere]] has been recorded in many of the earliest “Creation” texts of human culture. The “God” portrayed in the Book of Genesis is what [[William Blake]] refered to as the “Holy Reasoning Power.” For that remarkable power, captured so vividly and so remarkably honestly by the early Hebrew writers, fulfils and embodies all of the fundamental activities, properties and even personality, of left-brain circuitry. [[The right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts]]. Similarly, this early “God” of the Bible presents itself, as does the Demiurge of Plato’s Timaeus and indeed many other rational abstract deities, as a “Creator” God, but through textual analysis it is evident that it “creates” solely by abstracting and dividing experience (an existence usually in fact acknowledged as being eternal and pre-existing in these texts, but in a state that appears to its rational programmed Deity as being relatively “chaotic”, void, and “formless”).
