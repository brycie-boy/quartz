## Organisms will habituate to stressors that are experienced predictably

Not only does [a lack of predictability as to when a stressor will occur has been shown to increase chronic stress](A%20lack%20of%20predictability%20as%20to%20when%20a%20stressor%20will%20occur%20has%20been%20shown%20to%20increase%20chronic%20stress.md), organisms will eventually habituate to a [stressor](Stressor.md) if it is applied over and over; it may knock physiological [allostasis]() equally out of balance the umpteenth time that it happens, but it is a familiar, predictable [stressor](Stressor.md) by then, and a smaller [stress-response](Stress-response.md) is triggered. One classic demonstration involved men in the Norwegian military going through parachute training‚Äîas the process went from being hair-raisingly novel to something they could do in their sleep, their anticipatory stress-response went from being gargantuan to nonexistent. I feel like this has to do with the fact that [novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar](Novel%20experience%20and%20information%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20right%20hemisphere,%20and%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20once%20it%20becomes%20familiar.md). Once the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) feels like it has a grasp on the situation, it relaxes.
