## The decreased subjectivity correlated with decreased default mode network activity may lead to insights feeling objectively true

The process in which [decreased activity in the default mode network correlated with a decreased sense of self](Decreased%20activity%20in%20the%20default%20mode%20network%20correlated%20with%20a%20decreased%20sense%20of%20self.md) might help explain another feature of the mystical experience: the fact that the insights it sponsors are felt to be objectively true‚Äîrevealed truths rather than plain old insights. It could be that in order to judge an insight as merely subjective, one person‚Äôs opinion, you must first have a sense of subjectivity. Which is precisely what the mystic on [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s has lost.
