## Western progressivism distiguishes western and eastern mysticism

‚ÄúWestern progressivism‚Äù (or Utopianism) came out of the mid-East and is the distinct contribution of the Jews, which is why all reactionaries are intuitively anti-Semitic. As [William Blake]() wrote of this tradition: 

 > 
 > The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I asked them how they dared so roundly to assert that God spoke to them; and whether they did not think at the time that they would be misunderstood & so be the cause of imposition. Isaiah answer‚Äôd: ‚ÄòI saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical perception; but my senses discover‚Äôd the infinite in everything, and as I was then persuaded & remain confirmed that the voice of honest indignation is the voice of God, I cared not for consequences, but wrote.‚Äô

This vision of the infinite in everything ([emptiness](Emptiness.md)) is common to East and West; what is distinctly Western, out of the Jews, is the voice of honest indignation against every institution which would deny or demean the infinity within each human. The release of our full human potential‚Äîto let the light of Prometheus shine everywhere‚Äîis the distinctly Western [mystic](Mysticism.md) tradition and does not appear in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism or any Eastern religion, which tend to advocate for renunciation.

[Thomas Jefferson]() developed his view that ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù from the perception of the infinity within each of us, which he learned from the Scottish philosophers, Reid and Hutcheson. (It was also from Hutcheson that Jefferson got his idea of ‚Äúunalienable rights,‚Äù which Congress in the interest of stylistic elegance altered to ‚Äúinalienable rights.‚Äù) The Scottish Enlightenment, like the French and English Enlightenment, was the beginning of the materialization and manifestation of the Judeo-Christian vision of the Heavenly City. It was also this 18th Century Illuminati circle which introduced the concept of progress‚Äîthe conscious formulation of the symbolism of Prometheus.
