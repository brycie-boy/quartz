## We should think in terms of tuned-in and not-tuned-in rather than by existence and nonexistence  #‚è≥

Since [Facts are only appearances which we have decided to believe are factual](Facts%20are%20only%20appearances%20which%20we%20have%20decided%20to%20believe%20are%20factual.md) and "existence" appears to be meaningless (scientifically indeterminate forever) or some kind of [Game rule](Game%20rule.md) in disguise, then we should not talk about it at all if we want to make sense. What we can talk sensebly about is the tuned-in and the not-tuned-in. The microscopic world was not nonexistent before we developed microscopes but was only not-tuned-in. The beauty seen by a painter is not necessarily nonexistent for a money-oriented business man but is just not-tuned-in, because it is not relevent to his [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md). 

If we talk about the tuned-in and the not-tuned-in, we can make scientific statements that are operationally and scientificallly meaningful, although limited by our space-time cooridinates. When we talk about existence and nonexistence, on the other hand, we make statements that can never be totally confirmed ([When a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challenges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain](When%20a%20system%20of%20thought%20becomes%20less%20than%20totally%20trivial,%20an%20infinite%20regress%20of%20challenges%20manifest%20and%20it%20becomes%20increasingly%20uncertain.md)) or perhaps can never be totally refuted, which means we are making operationally [meaningless statement](Meaningless%20statement.md)s. 

It is not impossible that many "unscientific" [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md)s explored by painters, poets, musicians, novelists, mystics, etc. may not be non-existent but simply not-tuned-in by those who have not practiced for years in tuning in to painter, poetic, musical, novelist, or mystic experiences.
