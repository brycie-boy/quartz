## We should think in terms of tuned-in and not-tuned-in rather than by existence and nonexistence  #‚è≥ 

Since [[Facts are only appearances which we have decided to believe are factual]] and "existence" appears to be meaningless (scientifically indeterminate forever) or some kind of [[Game rule]] in disguise, then we should not talk about it at all if we want to make sense. What we can talk sensebly about is the tuned-in and the not-tuned-in. The microscopic world was not nonexistent before we developed microscopes but was only not-tuned-in. The beauty seen by a painter is not necessarily nonexistent for a money-oriented business man but is just not-tuned-in, because it is not relevent to his [[reality tunnel]]. 

If we talk about the tuned-in and the not-tuned-in, we can make scientific statements that are operationally and scientificallly meaningful, although limited by our space-time cooridinates. When we talk about existence and nonexistence, on the other hand, we make statements that can never be totally confirmed ([[When a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challenges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain]]) or perhaps can never be totally refuted, which means we are making operationally [[meaningless statement]]s. 

It is not impossible that many "unscientific" [[reality tunnel]]s explored by painters, poets, musicians, novelists, mystics, etc. may not be non-existent but simply not-tuned-in by those who have not practiced for years in tuning in to painter, poetic, musical, novelist, or mystic experiences.
