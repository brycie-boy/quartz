THE NEW COMMEN

The theogony of our Law is entirely scientific, Nuit is Matter,  
Hadit is Motion, in theirfull physical sense. [C2] They are the Tao and Teh of Chinese Philosophy; or,  
to put itvery simply, the Noun and Verb in grammar. Our central Tr  
uth -- beyond otherphilosophies -- is that these two infinities cannot exist apart. T  
his extensive subjectmust be studied in our other writings, notably Berashith,  
my own Magical Diaries,especially those of 1919, 1920 and 1921, and The Book of Wisdom or Folly.  
See alsoThe Soldier and the Hunchback.  
Further information concerning Nuit and Hadit isg  
iven in the course of this Book; but I must here mention that the Brother mentioned inconnexion with the Wizard Amalantrah etc. (Samuel bar A  
iwaz) identifies them withANU and ADAD the supreme Mother and Father deities of the Sumerians. Ta  
ken inconnexion with the AIWAZ identification, this is very striking indeed. [M2]  
I  
t is also to be considered that Nu is connected with North, while Had is Sad, Set, Satan,S  
at (equals "Being" in Sanskrit), South. He is then the Sun, one point concentratingSpace, as also is any other star.  
[Q2]  
  
For the North-South antithesis see Fabre d'Olivet'sHermeneutic Interpretation of the Origin of the Social State in Man.

THE NEW¬†  
COMMENTThis explains the general theme of this revelation: gives the Dramatis Personae,  
so tos  
peak.It is cosmographically, the conception of the two Ultimate Ideas; Space, and T  
hat whicho  
ccupies Space.I  
t will however appear later that these two ideas may be resolved into one, that ofMatter; with Space, its 'Condition' or 'form', included therein. T  
his leaves the idea of'  
Motion' for Hadit, whose interplay with Nuit makes the Universe.Time should perhaps be considered as a particular kind or dimension of Space. [C4]  
Further, this verse is to be taken with the next. T  
he 'company of heaven' is Mankind,a  
nd its 'unveiling' is the assertion of the independent godhead of every man and everyw  
oman!Further, as Khabs (see verse 8)  
is "Star", there is a further meaning; this Book is toreveal the Secret Self of a man, i.e. to initiate him. [M3]

AL I.3: "Every man and every woman is a star{.}" [EGI03]

THE NEW¬†  
COMMENTThis thesis is fully treated in The Book of Wisdom or Folly.  
Its main statement is thate  
ach human being is an Element of the Cosmos, self-determined and supreme, co-equalw  
ith all other Gods.From this the Law "Do what thou wilt" follows logically.  
One star influences anotherby attraction, of course; but these are incidents of self-predestined orbits. T  
here is,however,  
a mystery of the planets, revolving about a star of whom they are parts; but Is

7

This theory is the only one which explains "why" the A  
bsolute limited itself, and why Itd  
oes not recognize Itself during its cycle of incarnations. It disposes of "Evil" and theO  
rigin of Evil; without denying Reality to "Evil", or insulting our daily observation andour common sense. [C6]

THE NEW¬†  
COMMENTThis is a great and holy mystery. Although each star has its own number,  
each numberi  
s equal and supreme. Every man and every woman is not only a part of God, but theUltimate God. "The Centre is everywhere and the circumference nowhere". T

asquaney in New Hampshire, U.S.A. and developed into fullness on varioussubsequent occasions. Each 'Star' is connected directly with every other star,  
and theSpace being Without Limit (Ain Soph)  
the Body of Nuith, any one star is as much theCentre as any other.  
Each man instinctively feels that he is the Centre of the Cosmos,a  
nd philosophers have jeered at his presumption. But it was he that was precisely right.T  
he yokel is no more 'petty' than the King, nor the earth than the Sun. Each simpleelemental Self is supreme, Very God of Very God. Ay, in this Book is Tr  
uth almostinsuff  
erably splendid, for Man has veiled himself too long from his own glory: he fearsthe abyss, the ageless Absolute. But Truth shall make him free! [12] [M4]

8

I  
t must be understood from the beginning that this book contains the keys of all thek  
nowledge necessary for the operation of the Magical Formulae of the world during theA  
eon which it initiates. In this very early verse is already given a Master Key tom  
athematics and metaphysics. On applying this to current problems of thought, it willbe discovered that the long-fast doors fly open at a touch. [Q3]

AL I.5: "Help me, O warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Childre  
no f men{!}" [13] [EGI05]

8

Here Nuit appeals, simply and directly,  
recognizing the separate function of each Star ofher Body. T  
hough all is One, each part of that One has its own special work, each Stari

8

The unveiling is the Proclamation of the Tr  
uth previously explained, that the Body ofNuith occupies Infinite Space, so that every Star thereof is W  
hole in itself, anindependent and absolute Unit. They differ as Carbon and Calcium differ,  
but each is as  
imple "immortal" Substance, or at least a form of some simpler Substance. Each soul ist  
hus absolute, and 'good' or 'evil' are merely terms descriptive of relations betweendestructible combinations. T  
hus Quinine is 'good' for a malarial patient, but 'evil' for thegerm of the disease. Heat is 'bad' for ice-cream and 'good' for coffee. T  
he indivisibleessence of things, their 'souls', are indifferent to all conditions soever,  
for none can inany way affect them. [M5]

THE NEW¬†  
COMMENTN  
uit formulates me as Hadit, especially in the three centres of consciousness of herBeing. In this way, for this purpose, I became the complement of Her. These centres are those of Love, Life and language. Duality is the condition of all three.It will appear later how it is that None and Tw  
o are identical; they are distinct in ourm  
inds only because those minds are conscious, and therefore think of "two" as theirown state. But the unconscious mind thinks Nothing, and is Nothing. Ye  
t it is the samem  
ind.Nuith selects three centres of Her Body to become "Tw  
o" with Hadit; for she asks me tod  
eclare Her in these three. Infinite freedom, all-embracing, for physical Love;boundless continuity for Life; and the silent rhythm of the Stars for Language. T  
hesethree conceptions are Her gift to us. [M7]

Kraat, that is ofthe Saviour of the World in the larger sense, and of mine own "Silent Self" in the lesser.

This is the Task of the A  
dept, to have the Knowledge and Conversation of His HolyGuardian Angel, to become aware of his nature and his purpose, fulfilling them. [Q4]

AL I.8: "The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs{.}" [EGI08]

11

THE NEW¬†  
COMMENTWe  
are not to regard ourselves as base beings, without whose sphere is Light or "God".Our minds and bodies are veils of the Light within. T  
he uninitiate is a "Dark Star", andthe Great Work for him is to make his veils transparent by 'purifying' them. T  
his'purification' is really 'simplification'; it is not that the veil is dirty,  
but that thecomplexity of its folds makes it opaque. The Great Wo  
rk therefore consists principallyi  
n the solution of complexes. Everything in itself is perfect, but when things aremuddled, they become 'evil'. (This will be understood better in the Light of T  
he Hermitof Esopus Island,  
[17]  
q.v.) T  
he Doctrine is evidently of supreme importance, from itsposition as the first 'revelation' of A

11

This 'star' or 'Inmost Light' is the original, individual, eternal essence. The Khu¬†  
is them  
agical garment which it weaves for itself, a 'form' for its Being Beyond Form, by useof which it can gain experience through self-consciousness, as explained in the n  
ote toverses 2 and 3. This Khu is the first veil, far subtler than mind or body,  
and truer; for itssymbolic shape depends on the nature of its Star.

11

Why are we told that the Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs?  
Did we thensuppose the converse? I think that we are warned against the idea of a Pleroma,  
a flameof which we are Sparks, and to which we return when we 'attain'. T  
hat would indeed bet  
o make the whole curse of separate existence ridiculous, a senseless and inexcusablefolly. It would throw us back on the dilemma of Manichaeism. T  
he idea of incarnations"perfecting" a thing originally perfect by definition is imbecile. T  
he only sane solutionis as given previously,  
to suppose that the Perfect enjoys experience of (apparent)I  
mperfection. (There are deeper resolutions of this problem appropriate to the highestgrades of initiation; but the above should suffice the average intelligence.) [M9]

AL I.11: "These are fools that men adore; both their Gods and their men are

,  
as it seems. I prefer to suggest that these"  
fools" are "Silent selves", impotent babes unborn; then verse 12 continues "Comeforth!", that is, bring your Holy Guardian A  
ngel from the womb of yoursubconsciousness. Then, "take your fill of love"; that is, do your True Wi  
ll, whose modeof fulfilment is love, as explained later in this chapter.  
[M10]

15

The whole doctrine of 'love' is discussed in the Book Aleph (Wisdom or Folly)

AL I.15: "Now ye shall know that the chosen priest and¬†  
apostle of infinite space isthe prince-priest the Beast{;} and in // his woman called the Scarlet Wo  
man is allpower given. They shall gather my children into their fold: Th  
ey shall bring theg lory of the stars into the hearts of men." [20] [EGI15]

17

THE NEW¬†  
COMMENTThe definition of "infinite space" offered in the Comment on verse 13¬†  
is useful here.My Wo  
rk is in great part to insist upon the infinite possibilities of human development.M  
an has too slavishly acquiesced in his limitations. Science itself has shewn itselfa  
lmost as intolerant as Religion toward certain lines of research. Indeed, every elementof society has added its energ  
y to the opposition which bars each pioneer withundiscriminating stupidity. Darwin, Pasteur, Lister,  
and Jenner met with the samef  
erocious cowardice as Shelly and Luther; they were assailed on every ground fromR  
eligion and Morality upwards; every falsehood that malice could invent was circulateda  
bout them. In short, they were treated then as I am being treated now; and I amresolute to prosecute my Wo

That which is beneath is like that which is above. The Beast and the Scarlet Wo

It is necessary to say here that T

T  
he sun and moon, in their occult sense, are secondary representatives of this originalduality which is a phase of the Qabalistic Zero. Other correspondences are [Yang] [H5]  
and Yin, Yod and He,  
etc. But most such dualities have been conceived in very gross andu  
nphilosophical forms. Of course, it is impossible to grasp this subject properly byr  
eason; only the understanding developed by meditation and spiritual experience avails.Initiation is pantomorphously progressive. [Q9] [M14]

23

THE NEW¬†  
COMMENTWe have here a further conception of the cosmographical scheme. Nuit is A  
ll that whiche  
xists, and the condition of that existence. Hadit is the Principle which causesmodifications in this Being. This explains how one may call Nuit Matter,  
and HaditM  
otion, in the highest physico-philosophical sense of those terms.We are asked to acquiesce in this Law of Nature. T  
hat is, we are not to opposeresistance to the perfect fluidity of the "Becoming" of Nature. Similarly,  
we are not toattach more importance to any one momentary appearance than to any other.  
For, the moment we do so, we confirm illusion of Duality. We  
assert Imperfection asa  
bsolute in

23

This question of making "no difference" as ordained is to regard the whole of the non-Ego or universe apparently external to the Self as a single phenomenon; Samadhi¬†  
onany one thing becomes therefore Samadhi on The Whole. T  
he mystic who "availeth inthis" can then perform his Great Wo  
rk of "love under will" in a single operation insteado  
f being obliged to unite himself with the non-Ego piecemeal. But see also theComment on verse 4,  
above.Notice the word "hurt", from he French heurter,  
meaning to knock against an obstacle.There is thus a strictly technical accuracy in the choice of the term. [C16]

THE NEW¬†

T

indeed as an essential part of the whole, hehas made himself Lord of the W  
hole as such. In fact, it is obvious on quite rationalg

I  
n order to have Motion one must have Change. In fact, one must have this in order to have anythingat all. Now this Change is what we call Love. thus "love under will" is the Law of Motion. The re-entrant character of this Motion is difficult to conceive; but the Aspirant is urg  
ed to try to assimilatethe idea. A¬†  
Hindu might compare the Cosmic process to a churn which out of milk made butter tofeed a milk-producing woman, every step in the cycle being a Progress of Joy.  
Ti  
me is necessarily created by us in order to make room for the apparent existence of the dualitywhich we devise for the presentation of unity, or nihility.  
"Tw  
o things" must evidently exist either in two places, or at two times, or both; else they would bei  
ndistinguishable.Two phenomena which diff  
er in time would be considered simultaneous if separated in space so thato  
ur observation of the former were delayed, for several reasons; and it is fairly easy to realize thepossibility.  
But it seems as if separation in space were somehow more intractable. I can see no priorir  
eason for this distinction; I think it arises from the fact that space is directly presented to our senses,w

30

Our universe is (after all) in one place, so far as we are concerned, i.e., in our sensoria,  
so that anyt  
wo impressions can only be registered by us as consecutive. Even when we are aware of theirsimultaneity, we are compelled to place them in sequence. Our sensorium¬†  
makes no distinctionb  
etween concrete and abstract ideas in this respect. Sensory impressions and general ideas aree  
qually grist for the mill. But we make a distinction between our record of events whose sequence isa necessary part of our comprehension of them, and those which are independent of our history. We  
i  
nsist on the sequence of school and college, but our general judgments are recognized asindependent of time. T  
his is peculiarly the case with our idea of the Ego, which we instinctivelyregard as if it were eternal and unchanging, though in fact it grows and decays continually. Ye  
t wethink of the incidents of boyhood as having occurred to the Ego, forming part of its character.

30

N  
ow since this Ego is only conscious by virtue of having formulated itself, or the Universe (as ithappens to view the case), in the form of Duality,  
and since all the experiences of the Ego arenecessary to it, as all phenomena soever are necessary,  
it is permissible to regard the totality of thee  
xperience of the Ego as the presentation in duality of a single simultaneous fact.I

30

T  
he man who fails to recognize it as such is hopelessly bewildered by the irrational character of theuniverse, which he takes to be real; and he cannot but regard it as aimless and absurd. T  
hea  
dventures of his body and mind, with their desires for material and moral well-being, are obviouslya  
s foredoomed to disaster as Don Quixote's. He must be a fool if he struggles on (against inexorablef  
ate) to obtain results which he knows can only end in catastrophe, a climax the more bitter as hec

I  
t is not surprising that these incidents should occur in an apparent disorderly sequence any morethan that the colours of a picture, or the words of a story,  
should not be disturbed according to an ap

I  
t will be said that nobody can realize himself so long as the presentation is imperfect, that is, solong as he is incarnated. T  
his is no doubt true in all rigour; but one can obtain an approximation tot  
he intended self-knowledge by withdrawing for a time to the monistic form of self-consciousness,which does not distinguish between the Ego and the Non-Ego; in other words, by attaining Samadhi.  
But the first experience of Samadhi¬†  
will then naturally be an ecstasy devoid of name or form, andc  
ontaining no elements distinguishable as such; and we know this to be the case. One has simplyd  
eprived oneself of the means of expression, and all dual consciousness disappears, together with itsf  
orms, time and space. One concludes from this that the Universe is identical with the Ego, and allt  
hings dissolve into a formless essence characterized by knowledge and bliss. But this early stage ofSamadhi¬†  
is an illusion, a sort of drunken dizziness. (So in sexual love, the ecstasy abolishes the Ego,apparently; it forg  
ets that duality was its cause, and must be equally real with itself, in one sense oranother). But subsequent Samadhi¬†  
teaches the adept that his universal instantaneous Unity exists as"None and Two"; and he learns that his Samadhi¬†  
is p

31

He becomes able to experience the truth of the statements in the Book of the Law,  
the nature ofNuith and Hadith, and of himself as a Star,  
unique, individual, and eternal, but yet a part of the Bodyo  
f Nuith, and therefore identical with all other stars in that respect.H  
e realizes himself as the "bed in working" of Nuith and Hadit, as a particular form assumed by thelatter for the sake of Variety in his "play" with the former; and he partakes in this play by his self-r  
ealization, which he synthesizes from the "events of his life".H  
e understands that these events are the resultant of the Universe as applied to him, so that hise  
xperience is equally unique and universal, each star being the centre of the cosmos, and theCosmos applicable as a whole to each star.

31

T  
he experiences of each angle of a triangle are common to all, for one can express any relation as af  
unction of any angle, at will. Each may be taken as the starting-point of the study of the propertiest  
o the triangle. But each angle is necessary to the triangle, and each is equally important to itse  
xistence. Each is bound to the others, and moreover each is in a sense illusory in respect of thet  
riangle, which is an idea, simple and ideal, whose unity is compelled to express itself and manifestits properties by extension as a plane figure. For no triangle can express the idea of a triangle. A  
nyt  
riangle must be either equilateral, isosceles or scalene, either acute, right-angled, or obtuse; and noone triangle can be all these at once; while the idea of a triangle includes all these, and infinite other,  
p  
ossibilities.In a similar way,  
Nuith and Hadith include all possible forms of existence; they can only realizeThemselves by creating an infinite variety of forms of Themselves, each one real as it is T  
heirimage, illusory as it is a partial and divided aspect of T  
he

31

Each such Star is intelligible to T  
hem, as a poem is to its author as a part of this soul mirrored by hism  
ind. But it is not intelligible to itself, because it has no relation with any other ideas; it only knowsi  
tself as the babe of its mother Nuith, to whom it yearns, being stirred by its father Hadith to expresst  
hat

31

To know itself, each such Star, or Soul, must eat of the Fruit of the Tr  
ee of Knowledge of Good andEvil, by accepting labour and pain as its portion, and death as its doom. T  
hat is, it must reveal itsnature to itself by formulating that nature as duality.  
It must express itself by a series of symbolicg  
estures ostensibly external to it, just as a painter reveals one facet of his Delight-Diamond byc  
overing a canvas with colours in such a way that the picture seems at first sight to representsomething outside himself. It must, in fact, repeat for itself the original Magick¬†  
of Nuith and Hadithw

32

As They made T  
hemselves visible piecemeal by fashioning particular Souls, expressing theImpersonal and Absolute Homogeneity by means of Personal Relative Heterogeneity,  
so, notforg  
etting their true nature as forms of the Infinite, whereby they are one with all, must the starsd  
evise methods of studying themselves.T  
hey must make images of themselves, apparently external, and they must represent their highlyc  
omplex qualities in a duality involving space and time. For each Star is of necessity related toevery other star,  
so that no influence is alien to its individuality; it must therefore observer itsreaction to every other star.  
J  
ust so are most chemical elements possessed of but few qualities directly appreciable by our senses;w  
e must learn their natures by putting them into relation with the other Elements in turn. (Note wellt  
hat this knowledge were impossible unless there were a variety of elements; so also the fact of ours  
elf-consciousness proves the existence of individual souls; all related, all parts of the One Soul, ino  
ne sense, but none the less independent in themselves, eternal entities expressing particulare

32

E  
ach star is in itself immune and innocent; its proper consciousness is monistic; it must thereforee  
mploy a body and mind as the instruments for interpreting its relations with other souls, andc  
omparing its nature with theirs. For the mind perceives the contrast of the Self and the not-Self, andp  
resents its experiences, classified and judged, to the soul as documents for the dossier; and theb  
ody reports to the mind the impressions received from its contact with alien forms as the sensesr

I  
t must naturally require many incarnations for the soul to begin to know itself with any degree ofp  
erfection; and one may recognize advanced souls by their minds, which understand the a nature oftheir work, are indiff  
erent to the body's preference for any special forms of experience, and seekeagerly after novel adventures (like a philatelist after rare stamps) to complete the collection. T  
heya

I  
t is important to understand the necessity of our present Universe. Perfection could do noto  
therwise than create Imperfection. But was there not original Imperfection? No; for Perfection ish  
ardly more than that original state, since we cannot conceive the total as susceptible of addition.[Q15] This is another view of the God going through the combinations, on a larg  
er scale, and showsn  
ot only why He does it, but why He must do it. But is not all this based on the accident that Ipersonally am bored by omniscience on any given matter? Ye  
s, but Imperfection is a fact, and a Godw  
hom Perfection did not bore would not have created Imperfection. But why not suppose a wickedGod, or a foolish God? T  
hings which seem to me wrong, or stupid, are so because I am the solejudge. But these things are not my creations, but those of other Gods. Tr  
ue, but those Gods are allp  
art of me, so far as I know them. So then, in my own nature are these contrary Gods, which (asabove said) I have created in myself to give variety.

The first paragraph is a general statement or definition of Sin or Error. A

The remainder of the paragraph takes a particular case as an example. T  
here shall be noproperty in human flesh. T  
he sex-instinct is one of the most deeply-seated expressionso  
f the will; and it must not be restricted, either negatively by preventing its freef

44

The sexual act is a sacrament of Will. To profane it is the great offence. A  
ll trueexpression of it is lawful; all suppression or distortion is contrary to the Law of Liberty.  
To  
use legal or financial constraint to compel either abstention or submission, is entirelyh  
orrible, unnatural and absurd. Physical constraint, up to a certain point, is not sos  
eriously wrong; for it has its roots in the original sex-conflict which we see in animals,and has often the eff  
ect of exciting Love in his highest and noblest shape. Some of themost passionate and permanent attachments have begun with rape. [H14]¬†  
Rome wasactually founded thereon. Similarly,  
murder of a faithless partner is ethically excusable,in a certain sense; for there may be some stars whose Nature is extreme violence. T  
hec  
ollision of galaxies is a magnificent spectacle, after all. But there is nothing inspiringin a visit to one's lawyer.  
Of course this is merely my personal view; a star whohappened to be a lawyer might see things otherwise! Yet Nature's unspeakable variety,  
though it admits cruelty and selfishness, off

L  
aws against adultery are based upon the idea that woman is a chattel, so that to makel  
ove to a married woman is to deprive the husband of her services. It is the frankest andmost crass statement of a slave-situation. To us, every woman is a star.  
She hastherefore an absolute right to travel in her own orbit. T  
here is no reason why she shouldn  
ot be the ideal hausfrau, if that chance to be her will. But society has no right to insistu  
pon that standard. It was, for practical reasons, almost necessary to set up such taboosi  
n small communities, savage tribes, where the wife was nothing but a general servant,w  
here the safety of the people depended upon a high birth-rate. But to-day woman iseconomically independent, becomes more so every year. T  
he result is that she instantlya  
sserts her right to have as many or as few men or babies as she wants or can get; andshe defies the world to interfere with her.

Similarly, one may say that not to do one's will is evidence of mental or moral insanity.

It is of course better to expel or destroy an irreconcilable. "If thine eye off

are all members of the Body of God, the Sun; and about our System is theOcean of Space. T

Darkness", "Illusion", whatever one chooses to call it, is simply a phenomenon ofa  
ccidental and temporary separateness. If you are "walking in darkness", do not try tom

"  
As ye will." It should be abundantly clear from the foregoing remarks that eachi  
ndividual has an absolute and indefeasible right to use his sexual vehicle in accordancewith its own proper character,  
and that he is responsible only to himself. But he shouldn  
ot injure himself and his right aforesaid; acts invasive of another individual's equalrights are implicitly self-aggressions. A¬†  
thief can hardly complain on theoreticalg  
rounds if he is himself robbed. Such acts as rape, and the assault or seduction ofinfants, may therefore be justly regarded as offences against the Law of Liberty,  
andrepressed in the interests of that Law.

canon is no less deadly in love than in artor literature; its acceptance stifles style, and its enforcement extinguishes sincerity.

55

It is better for a person of heterosexual nature to suff  
er every possible calamity as thei  
ndirect environment-evoked result of his doing his true will in that respect than toenjoy health, wealth and happiness by means either of suppressing sex altogether,  
ofd  
ebauching it to the service of Sodom or Gommorrah.E  
qually it is better for the androgyne, the urning, or their feminine counterparts toe  
ndure blackmailers private and public, the terrors of police persecution, the disgust,contempt and loathing of the vulgar,  
and the self-torture of suspecting the peculiarity tob

bring down this doctrine to a practical rule for every man or woman by which theymay enjoy,  
in perfection, their sexual life and make it what it rightly is, the holiest parto  
f the religious life, I say 'holiest' because it redeems even physical grossness to partakewith spiritual saintship, the intention of this Book of the Law¬†  
is perfectly simple.Whatever your sexual predilections may be, you are free, by the Law of Thelema,  
to thet  
he star you are, to go your own way rejoicing. It is not indicated here in this text,t  
hought it is elsewhere implied, that only one symptom warns that you have mistakenyour true Wi

as a general rule, foryour sexual gratification to destroy, deform, or displease any other star.

T  
he most important condition of the act, humanly speaking, is that the attraction shouldbe spontaneous and irresistible; a leaping up of the will to create with lyrical frenzy.  
thisf  
irst condition once recognized, it should be surrounded with every circumstance ofworship. Study and experience should furnish a technique of love. A  
ll science, all art,every elaboration should emphasize and adorn the expression of the enthusiasm. A  
llstrength and all skill should be summoned to fulfil the frenzy,  
and life itself should bef

The Book of the Law emphasizes the importance of these considerations. T  
he act oflove must be spontaneous, in absolute freedom. T  
he man must be true to himself.Romeo must not be thrust on Rosaline for family,  
social, or financial reasons.Desdemona must not be barred from Othello for reasons of race or religion. T  
heh  
omosexual must not blaspheme his nature and commit spiritual suicide by suppressinglove or attempting to pervert it, as ignorance and fear,  
shame and weakness, so ofteninduce him to do. W

T  
his whole trouble comes from humanity's horror of Love. For the last hundred years,e  
very first-rate writer on morals has sent forth his lightnings and thunders, hailstonesa  
nd coals of fire, to burn up Gommorrah and Sodom where Love is either shameful ands  
ecret, or daubed with dung of sentiment in order that the swinish citizens mayrecognize their ideal therein. We  
do not tell the artist that his art is so sacred, sod  
isgusting, so splendid and so disgraceful that he must not on any account learn the useo  
f the tools of his trade, and study in school how to see with his eye, and record what hesees with his hand. We  
do not tell the man who would heal disease that he must notk  
now his subject, from anatomy to Pathology; or bid him undertake to remove anappendix from a valued A

67

But we of Thelema,  
like the artist, the true lover of Love, shameless and fearless, seeingG  
od face to face alike in our own souls within and in all Nature without, though we use,as the bourg  
eois does, the word Love, we hold not the word "too often profaned for usto profane it;" it burns inviolate in its sanctuary,  
being reborn immaculate with everybreath of life. But by 'Love' we mean a thing which the eye of the bourg  
eois hath notseen, nor his ear heard; neither hath his heart conceived it. We  
have accepted Love ast  
he meaning of Change, Change being the Life of all Matter soever in the Universe.And we have accepted Love as the mode of Motion of the Will to Change. To  
us everya  
ct, as implying Change, is an act of Love. Life is a dance of delight, its rhythm ani  
nfinite rapture that never can weary or stale. Our personal pleasure in it is derived noto  
nly from our own part in it, but from our conscious apprehension of its totalperfections. We  
study its structure, we expand ourselves as we lose ourselves inunderstanding it, and so becoming one with it. Wi

burn the body on the altar of Love, that even thebrute may serve the Will of the Soul. We must then study the art of Bodily Love. We  
must not balk or bungle. We must be cool and competent as surg

The 'old time' is the A

Note that Knowledge is Daath, Child of Chokmah by Binah,  
and crown ofMicroprosopus; yet he is not one of the Sephiroth, and his place is in the A  
byss. By thiss  
ymbolism we draw attention to the fact that Knowledge is by nature impossible; for itimplies Duality and is therefore relative. A

must proceed either to the identity which means ultimately "Nothing," or to diverg  
entd  
iversities which only seem to mean something so long as we refrain from pushing thea  
nalysis of any term to its logical elements. For example, "Sugar is sugar" is obviouslyn  
ot knowledge. But no more is this: "Sugar is a sweet white crystalline carbo-hydrate."F  
or each of these four terms describes a sensory impression on ourselves; and we defineour impressions only in terms of such things as sugar. T  
hus "sweet" means "the qualityascribed by our taste to honey, sugar,  
etc."; "white" is "what champaks, zinc oxide,sugar, etc. report to our eyesight;" and so on. The proposition is ultimately an identity,  
f  
or all our attempts to evade the issue by creating complications. "Knowledge" istherefore not a "thing-in-itself;" it is rightly denied a place upon the Tr  
ee of Life; itpertains to the A

What then may we understand by this verse, with its capital K for "Knowledge?" W  
hatis it, and how shall it "go aright?" T  
he key is in the word "go." It cannot "be," as weh  
ave seen above; it is the fundamental error of the "Black Brothers" in their policy ofresisting all Change, to try to maintain it as fixed and absolute. But (as the Tr  
ee of Lifei  
ndicates) Knowledge is the means by which the conscious mind, Microprosopus,reaches to Understanding and to Wisdom, its mother and father,  
which reflectrespectively Nuith and Hadit from the Ain and Kether. T  
he process is to use each newi  
tem of knowledge to correct and increase one's comprehension of the Subject of theProposition. Thus ARB should tell us: A is (not A, as we supposed) but A. T  
hisfacilitates the discovery A,R,C leading to A, is A  
(index2); and so on. In practice, everyt  
hing that we learn about (e.g.) "horse" helps us to understand -- to enjoy -- the idea.The diff  
erence between the scholar and the schoolboy is that the former glows andexults when he is reminded of some word like Thalassa. Ourselves:- W

It follows that, as Hadit can never be known, there is no death. T

FourteenthAethyr.  
One may attain to be aware that one is but a particular 'child' of the Play ofH  
adit and Nuit; one's personality is then perceived as being a disguise. It is not only nota

The W  
heel and the Circle are evidently symbols of Nuith; this sentence insists upon theconception of Lingam-Yoni.  
But beyond the obvious relation, we observe twogeometrical definitions. T  
he axle is a cylinder set perpendicularly to the plane of thew  
heel; thus Hadit supplies the third dimension to Nuith. It suggests that Matter is to beconceived as Tw  
o-dimensional; that is, perhaps, as possessed of two qualities, extensionand potentiality. To these Hadit brings motion and position. T  
he wheel moves;m  
anifestation now is possible. Its perception implies three-dimensional space, and time.But note that the Mover is himself not moved. T  
he "cube in the circle" emphasizes thisquestion of dimensions. T  
he cube is rectilinear (therefore phallic no less than the axle);i  
ts unity suggests perfection projected as a "solid" for human perception; its squarefaces affirm balance, equity,  
and limitation; its six-sidedness sets it among the solars  
ymbols. It is thus like the Sun in the Zodiac, which is no more than the field for Hisf  
ulfilment in His going. He, by virtue of his successive relations with each degree of thec  
ircle, clothes Himself with an appearance of "Matter in Motion," although absolutem  
otion through space is a meaningless expression (Eddington, op. cit.). None the less,e  
very point in the cube -- there are 2 of them -- has an unique relation with every pointin the circle exactly balanced against an equal and opposite relation. We  
have thusM  
atter that both is and is not, Motion that both moves and moves not, interacting in av  
ariety of ways which is infinite to manifest individuals, each of which is unlike anyother,  
yet is symmetrically supported by its counterpart. Note that even at the centre ofgravity of the cube no two rays are identical except in mere length. They diff

Why is Nuith restricted to two dimensions? We

asy to imagine" (Eddington, op. cit. p.158) and prefers to attribute a geometrical formwhose resemblance to the Kteis¬†  
is most striking. For Nuit is, philosophically speaking,the archetype of the Kteis, giving appropriate Form to all Being, and off  
ering everyp  
ossibility of fulfilment of every several point that it envelops. But Nuith cannot bes  
ymbolized as three-dimensional, in our system; each unit has position by three spatial,a

I  
n a deeper sense, the word "Death" is meaningless apart from the presentation of theUniverse as conditioned by "Time." But what is the meaning of Ti  
me?T  
here is great confusion of thought in the use of the word "eternal," and the phrase "forever.  
" People who want "eternal happiness" mean by that a cycle of varying events alleff  
ective in stimulating pleasant sensations; i.e., they want time to continue exactly as itdoes with themselves released from the contingencies of accidents such as poverty,  
sickness and death. A  
n eternal state is however a possible experience, if one interpretsthe term sensibly. One can kindle flamman aeternae caritatis,  
for instance; one cane  
xperience a love which is in truth eternal. Such love must have no relation withphenomena whose condition is time. Similarly, one's "immortal soul" is a diff  
erent kindof thing altogether from one's mortal vesture. This Soul is a particular Star,  
with its ownp  
eculiar qualities, of course; but these qualities are all "eternal," and part of the natureof the Soul. T  
his Soul being a monistic consciousness, it is unable to appreciate itselfa  
nd its qualities, as explained in a previous entry; so it realizes itself by the device ofduality, with the limitations of time, space and causality. The "Happiness" of We  
ddedLove or eating Marrons Glaces¬†  
is a concrete external non-eternal expression of thec  
orresponding abstract internal eternal idea, just as any triangle is one partial andi  
mperfect picture of the idea of a triangle. (It does not matter whether we consider"Tr

they nol

103

In the same way a poet or painter, wishing to express Beauty,  
is impelled to choose ap  
articular form; with luck, this is at first able to recompense in him what he feels; buts  
ooner or later he finds that he has failed to include certain elements of himself, and hem  
ust needs embody these in a new poem or picture. He may know that he can never dom  
ore than present a part of the possible perfection, and that in imperfect imagery; but atl  
east he may utter his utmost within the limits of the mental and sensory instruments ofhis similarly inadequate symbol of the A  
bsolute,¬†

103

These suffer from the same defects as the other forms; ultimately,  
"Happiness" weariesitself in the eff  
ort to invent fresh images, and becomes disheartened and doubtful ofi  
tself. Only a few people have wit enough to proceed to generalization from the failureo  
f a few familiar figures of itself, and recognize that all "actual" forms are imperfect;b  
ut such people are apt to turn with disgust from the whole procedure, and to long forthe "eternal" state. T  
his state is however incapable of realization, as we know; and theS  
oul understanding this, can find no good but in "Cessation" of all things, its creationsno more than its own tendencies to create. It therefore sighs for Nibbana.

103

But there is one other solution, as I have endeavoured to shew. We  
may accept (whatafter all it is absurd to accuse and oppose) the essential character of existence. We  
c  
annot extirpate or even alter in the minutest degree either the matter or manner of anye  
lement of the Universe, here each item is equally inherent and important, eacha  
equipollent, independent, and interdependent.We may thus acquiesce in the fact that it is apodeictically implicit in the A  
bsolute toa  
pprehend itself by self-expression as Positive and Negative in the first place, and toc  
omb

103

We may thus cease either (1) to seek the A  
bsolute in any of its images, knowing that wem  
ust abstract every one of their qualities from every one of these equally if we wouldunveil it; or (2) to reject all images of the A  
bsolute, knowing that attainment thereofw  
ould be the signal for the manifestation of that part of its nature which necessarilyf  
ormulates itself in a new universe of images.R  
ealizing that these two courses (the materialist's and the mystic's) are equally fatuous,w  
e may engage in either or both of two other plans of action, based on assent toactuality.

103

We  
may (1) ascertain our own particular properties as partial projections of theA  
bsolute; we may allow every image presented to us to be of equally intrinsic ande  
ssential entity with ourselves, and its presentation to us a phenomenon necessary inN  
ature; and we may adjust our apprehension to the actuality that every event is an itemin the account which we render to ourselves of our own estate. We  
dare not desire toomit any single entry, lest the balance be upset. We  
may react with elasticity andindiff  
erence to each occurrence, intent only on the idea that the total, intelligentlyappreciated, constitutes a perfect knowledge not indeed of the A  
bsolute but of that partthereof which is ourselves. We thus adjust one imperfection accurately to another,  
andr

This path, the "Way of the Tao,

he Equation Five plus Six is Eleven is of the same orderof perfection as Ten Million times Ten times Ten T

bsolute, every point is equally the Centre; every pointi

T  
his is the only way to deal with reason. Reason is like a woman; if you listen, you arel  
ost; with a thick stick, you have some sort of sporting chance. Reason leads thep  
hilosopher to self-contradiction, the statesman to doctrinaire follies; it makes thewarrior lay down his arms, and the lover cease to rave. W  
hat is so unreasonable asman? The only Because in the lover's litany is Because I love you. We  
want no skeletons

119

Philosophically, 'Because is absurd.' There is no answer to the question "Why." T  
hegreatest thinkers have been sceptics or agnostics: omnia exeunt in mysterium,  
andsumma scientia nihil scire are old commonplaces. In my essays 'Truth' (in K  
onx OmP ax [16]), The Soldier and the Hunchback, Eleusis and others, I have off  
ered adetailed demonstration of the self-contradictory nature of Reason. T  
he crux of thew  
hole proof may be summarized by saying that any possible proposition must beequally true with its contradictory,  
as, if not, the universe would no longer be ine  
quilibrium. It is no objection that to accept this is to destroy conventional Logic, fort

I ask "What is (e.g.) a tree?" T

he sameapplies to any "Why" that may be posed. T  
he one existing mystery disappears as ac

ask questions is thus evidently worse than a waste of time, so far as one is lookingfor an answer.

There is also the point that any proposition S is P merely includes P¬†  
in the connotationo  
f S, and is therefore not really a statement of relation between two things, but ana  
mendment of the definition of one of them. "Some cats are black" only means that ouri  
dea of a cat involves the liability to appear black, and that blackness is consistent withthose sets of impressions which we recognize as characteristic of cats. A  
ll ratiocinationmay be reduced to syllogistic form; hence, the sole eff  
ect of the process is to make eacht  
erm more complex. Reason does not add to our knowledge; a filing system does notincrease one's correspondence directly,  
though by arranging it one gets a better grasp ofone's business. T  
hus coordination of our impressions should help us to control them;b  
ut to allow reason to rule us is as abject as to expect the exactitude of our ledgers toe

This striving is to be strenuous. We  
are not to set our lives at a pin's fee. "Unhand me,g  
entlemen! I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!" Death is the End that crowns theWo  
rk.Evolution works by variation. W  
hen an animal develops one part of itself beyond theothers, it infringes the norm of its type. At first this eff  
ort is made at the expense ofother eff  
orts, and it seems as if, the general balance being upset, the Nature were indanger.  
(It must obviously appear so to the casual observer -- who probably reproachesa  
nd persecutes the experimenter). But when this variation is intended to meet somenew,  
or even foreseen, change in environment, and is paid for by some surplus part, ors  
ome part now superfluous, although once useful to meet a quality of the environmentw  
hich no longer menaces the individual, the adaptation is biologically profitable.Obviously, the whole idea of exercise, mental or bodily,  
is to develop the involvedorgans in manner physiologically and psychologically proper.  
It is deleterious to force any faculty to live by an alien law. W

Every org  
an has 'no law beyond Do what thou wilt'. Its law is determined by the historyof its development, and by its present relations with its fellow-citizens. We  
do notf  
ortify our lungs and our limbs by identical methods, or aim at the same tokens ofsuccess in training the throat of the tenor and the fingers of the fiddler.  
But all laws area  
like in this: they agree that power and tone come from persistently practising theproper exercise without overstraining. W  
hen a faculty is freely fulfilling its function, itw  
ill grow; the test is its willingness to 'strive ever to more'; it justifies itself by being'  
ever joyous'. It follows that 'death is the crown of all'. For a life which has fulfilled alli  
ts possibilities ceases to have a purpose; death is its diploma, so to speak; it is ready toapply itself to the new conditions of a larg

Note that the Atu "Death" in the Tarot refers to Scorpio. T

But in this verse the main point is that death is the 'crown' of all. The crown is Kether,  
the Unity; "Love under will" having been applied to all Nuith-possibilities of all Khu-energies of any Hadit-central-Star, that Star has exhausted itself perfectly,  
completedo

The one way of safety lies in applying the Law of Thelema with the utmost rigour.  
E  
very impulse, however feeble, is necessary to the stability of the whole structure; thet  
iniest flaw may cause the cannon to burst. Every impulse however opposite to the mainm  
otive, is part of the plan; the rifling does not thwart the purpose of the barrel. Ones  
hould therefore acquiesce in every element of one's nature, and develop it as its ownlaws demand, with absolute impartiality.  
One need not fear; there is a natural limit tot  
he growth of any species; it either finds food fail, or is choked by its neighbours, oroverg  
rows itself, and is transformed. Nor need one fret about the harmony andp  
roportion of one's various faculties; the fit will survive, and the perfection of the wholew

shrewd skill, and accurate subtlety; but thento content himself with indefatigable energy,

articular star of the Body of Nuit, from whom, in the strictest scientific sense, comet  
his earth, a chilled spark of Him, and all our Light and Life. His vice-regent andr  
epresentative in the animal kingdom is His cognate symbol the Phallus, representingLove and Liberty. Ra-Hoor-Khuit, like all true Gods, is therefore a Solar-Phallic deity.  
But we regard Him as He is in truth, eternal; the Solar-Phallic deities of the old A  
eon,such as Osiris, "Christ", Hiram, A  
donis, Hercules, &c., were supposed, through ourignorance of the Cosmos, to 'die' and rise again'. T

We of Thelema say that "Every man and every woman is a star." We  
do not fool andflatter women; we do not despise and abuse them. To  
us a woman is Herself, absolute,o

arrogate no right upon Her will; wec  
laim not to deflect Her development, to dispose of Her desires, or to determine Herdestiny. She is Her own sole arbiter; we ask no more than to supply our strength to Her,

nd sottish, with an imbecile laugh and a pretty taste in fancy waistcoats. He lacksvirility, like the ox which is the meaning of the letter Aleph which describes the Tr  
ump,and his value is Zero, its number. He is air,  
formless and incapable of resistance, carriero  
f sounds which mean nothing to it, swept up into destructive rages of senselessv
