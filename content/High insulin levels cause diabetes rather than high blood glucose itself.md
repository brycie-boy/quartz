## High insulin levels cause diabetes rather than high blood glucose itself

[Diabetes](Diabetes.md) is not really about [blood glucose](). [Blood glucose]() is just the indirect measurable proxy for the real culprit—which is the blood [insulin](Insulin.md) level. [Insulin](Insulin.md) is the real bad guy in this story—it is its own risk factor, and while high [blood glucose]() can trigger an [insulin](Insulin.md) response, most of the time your blood [insulin](Insulin.md) is unrelated to [blood glucose]().  We know this at a basic molecular level, because of seminal mouse studies done by Dr. [C. Ron Kahn]()’s lab at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.

Kahn’s lab constructed eight separate tissue-specific [insulin](Insulin.md) [receptor](Receptor.md) knockout (IRKO) models. Each mouse was genetically engineered to be missing their [insulin](Insulin.md) [receptor](Receptor.md) in a different [organ]() (normally, both mice and humans have [\[insulin]() [receptor](Receptor.md)s in every [organ]()), and therefore [insulin](Insulin.md) has different effects in each mouse. The scientists took the [insulin](Insulin.md) [receptor](Receptor.md) out of the [liver](), [brain](Brain.md), [fat]() [cell]()s, brown [adipose tissue](), muscle, beta-[cell]()s, [vascular smooth muscle](), or [kidney](). Each mouse developed some form of pathology, none were healthy. But the pathologies were all different from each other.

Interestingly, only the [liver]() and the [brain](Brain.md) IRKO mice developed high [blood glucose](), and only the [brain](Brain.md) IRKO mouse became obese and developed [metabolic syndrome](Metabolic%20syndrome.md). And even more interestingly, the [kidney]() IRKO mouse had normal [blood glucose](), but developed diabetic [kidney]() disease anyway. These various mice show that the cause of the disease is not the high [blood glucose]()—it’s the [insulin](Insulin.md)! And this isn’t just in mice—we know this is true in humans as well. Because when people with type 1 [diabetes](Diabetes.md) ([insulin](Insulin.md) deficiency) are diagnosed, they have normal [kidney]()s, and it takes about ten to twenty years of bad [glucose]() control before they develop [kidney]() disease. Yet, people with [metabolic syndrome](Metabolic%20syndrome.md) ([insulin resistant](Insulin%20resistance.md)) already have [kidney]() disease even before their [glucose]() levels start to rise. Again, [modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it](Modern%20medicine%20tends%20to%20target%20the%20pathology%20of%20an%20illness%20rather%20than%20preventing%20it.md). The reason for this dichotomy is because [insulin can be both good and bad for you](Insulin%20can%20be%20both%20good%20and%20bad%20for%20you.md).
