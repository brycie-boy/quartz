## Mundane and supramundane wholesome kamma #‚è≥

Whereas [kamma](Kamma.md) springing from [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md) is bound to the world of [Samsara](Samsara.md), [kamma](Kamma.md) springing from [the three wholesome roots](The%20three%20wholesome%20roots.md) may be of two catagories, the mundane and the supramundane. The mundane [wholesome kamma](Wholesome%20kamma.md) has the potential to produce a fortunate [rebirth](Rebirth.md) within [Samsara](Samsara.md). The supramundane [wholesome kamma](Wholesome%20kamma.md) is [kamma](Kamma.md) that leads to the escape from [Samsara](Samsara.md) and is generated by developing [The Nobel Eightfold Path](The%20Nobel%20Eightfold%20Path.md) and the other aids to the realization of [Nibbana](Nibbana.md). This is the [kamma](Kamma.md) that dismantles the entire process of kammic causation.
