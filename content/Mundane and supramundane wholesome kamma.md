## Mundane and supramundane wholesome kamma #‚è≥ 

Whereas [[kamma]] springing from [[the three unwholesome roots]] is bound to the world of [[Samsara]], [[kamma]] springing from [[the three wholesome roots]] may be of two catagories, the mundane and the supramundane. The mundane [[wholesome kamma]] has the potential to produce a fortunate [[rebirth]] within [[Samsara]]. The supramundane [[wholesome kamma]] is [[kamma]] that leads to the escape from [[Samsara]] and is generated by developing [[The Nobel Eightfold Path]] and the other aids to the realization of [[Nibbana]]. This is the [[kamma]] that dismantles the entire process of kammic causation.
