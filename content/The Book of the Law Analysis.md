### Annotations

- 11. These are fools that men adore; both their Gods & their men are fools.
The Gods of the new Aeon spit on the gods and prophets of the old aeons

- 41. The word of Sin is Restriction. O man! refuse not thy wife, if she will! O lover, if thou wilt, depart! There is no bond that can unite the divided but love: all else is a curse. Accursed! Accursed be it to the aeons! Hell.
There‚Äôs a lot to unpack here. First, Crowley clarifies that the word of the old aeons was sin and restriction. He relates this to sex, marriage and monogomy as a form of restriction. In the new Aeon of Horus, there are no restrictions or sins as long as the individual listens to their true Will. Nuit then curses restriction. Furthermore, ‚Äúlove‚Äù is the act of uniting oneself with some other (this can be a person, idea, etc.).

- 40. Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into the word. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the man of Earth. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
And now we see the infamous command. Let‚Äôs pick through this. Adherents of the new religions are called, Thelemites or those who follow the Will. There are three grades of Thelemites which correspond to the Tree of Life (see verse 34). These represent major achievements in mastering your own soul, understanding the Law, getting in contact with your Holy Guardian Angel and living according to the Will rather than your own ego.

- 3. Every man and every woman is a star.
More on this throughout, but according Crowley the star is a person‚Äôs true, perfect, immortal, monist soul or self*.

- 8. The Khabs is in the Khu, not the Khu in the Khabs.
The ‚ÄúKhabs‚Äù (or star) is an individual‚Äôs true self in accordance with the Will; an individual within the body of the pantheistic Nuit. The ‚ÄúKhu‚Äù is one‚Äôs active consciousness or ego or ‚Äúpersonality soul.‚Äù Since the Khabs is immortal, the true self lives on eternally; while the body, mind and personality pass away after death or are (possibily) reincarnated. More on this later*.

9. Worship then the Khabs, and behold my light shed over you!
Crowley (or Aiwass/Nuit) is telling the reader to worship the Star, the True Will, the Absolute Self; and to realize the ‚ÄúKhabs‚Äù as their true self.

- 42. Let it be that state of manyhood bound and loathing. So with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy will.
Again, the old aeon was restrictive and odious. The new Aeon says that you have no right, except to live in accordance with the Will. This means you should only ‚Äúlove‚Äù (find connection with) things in accordance with your True Will.

- 43. Do that, and no other shall say nay.
Obviously, if you are living according to Thelema (a philosophy that bascially requires members to break social mores), you will get some push back from the followers of the word of restriction. So what is Crowley saying here? Well, according to Thelema, every man and woman is a star with an appropriate course (in the same way that a star has a¬† course). If you living according to your Will, or inner star, then you will live ‚Äì not in opposition to the universal Will ‚Äì but rather with it. None shall say nay because you are living the life that you should be ‚Äì and the universe will reward you.

- 44. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.
This passage might be cribbed from Reballas whose fictional Abbey of Thelema told people to ‚Äúdo what thou wilt.‚Äù You should want to live with the Will because it is perfect for you as an individual. Not because it will grant you anything or give you the results you want. It‚Äôs just the right way to live.

- 49. Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hath taken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods; and let Asar be with Isa, who also are one. But they are not of me. Let Asar be the adorant, Isa the sufferer; Hoor in his secret name and splendour is the Lord initiating.
All laws and customes are repealed. Horus the Child has taken his seat in the East (where the sun rises, and Thelema is a solar religion) at the Equinox of the Gods. The Equinox is the end of the old Aeon of the Resurected God (think of the various dead-and-resurections myths including Christianity) which is replaced with the Aeon of Horus which is ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù like a child. A child can perform a gentle or harmful act, but he or she may not understand the ramifications for doing it or whether it is good or evil. If we follow our Will in this new Aeon, we too will be ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù in our actions ‚Äì divorced from the stigmas of the past or the lust for result.

- 17. Hear me, ye people of sighing!
The sorrows of pain and regret
Are left to the dead and the dying,
The folk that not know me as yet.
The world is full of suffering, and those they abide by the religions of Restriction and Sin are suffering and causing suffering. Knowledge of Hadit can relieve that pain.

- 24. Behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends who be hermits. Now think not to find them in the forest or on the mountain; but in beds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eyes, and masses of flaming hair about them; there shall ye find them. Ye shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy; and there shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this. Beware lest any force another, King against King! Love one another with burning hearts; on the low men trample in the fierce lust of your pride, in the day of your wrath.
Hadit is a hermit. But don‚Äôt look for this hermit in caves like the ascetics. Instead look for them in the throws of passion.

But the Kings (Thelemites) must be certain not to force one another to do anything, because the perfect Will implies no conflict or contradiction for anyone on the path. But rather, those who do not obey the Will will be trampled by the new aeon.

- 22. I am the Snake that giveth Knowledge & Delight and bright glory, and stir the hearts of men with drunkenness. To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! They shall not harm ye at all. It is a lie, this folly against self. The exposure of innocence is a lie. Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.
The Snake is very similar to the serpent in theGarden of Eden, promising knowledge and glory. Crowley later compares Hadit to Satan, the serpent who climbs the Tree of Life to find reunification with god, but also provides wisdom and ferocity.

Hadit encourages his followers to live life to the fullest and experiement with drugs and drunkeness; promising that it will not harm them at all (similar to Mark 16:18). Crowley, of course, was a heavy drug user and an inspiration to counter cultural figureheads like Timothy Leary.

Hadit goes on to say that Restriction is a lie, and that any God that demands passion, pleasure and ecstasy in this life are liars.

- 27. There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes shall make a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit called Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason.
Those who do not understand this will waste much of the spiritual energy and waste their lives. Most of the time this is because they try to analyze the Will with Reason and logic. This becomes their pit an prison (Choronzon).

28. Now a curse upon Because and his kin!
Hadit curses Because and Reason.

29. May Because be accursed for ever!
Yup.

- 30. If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will stops & does nought.
Will does not need a Reason to act. Will just acts. It is Horus the Child. And a child acts with pure innocence whether or not he/she causes joy or harm.

Or as Damien says in The Omen III, ‚ÄúMost people confuse evil with their own trivial lusts and perversions. Now, true evil is as pure as innocence.‚Äù

Will cannot ask Why or Because, because then it would cease to be Will, its very nature.

31. If Power asks why, then is Power weakness.
Power never needs to ask for permission.

- 32. Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & all their words are skew-wise.
Human reason cannot fathom the infinite and unknown. Those that try to use Reason to assess the ultimate truth as deceived.

- 54. Nor shall they who cry aloud their folly that thou meanest nought avail; thou shall reveal it: thou availest: they are the slaves of because: They are not of me. The stops as thou wilt; the letters? change them not in style or value!
Fear not the ‚Äúslaves of because‚Äù because you are beyond them. Also do not change the letters of this Book, but publish them as there were written since even the shapes of the letters have hidden intent.

- 70. There is help & hope in other spells. Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein!
Be overcome by joy. But don‚Äôt be overcome by your animal nature. All action should be taken as a ritual under Will. Enjoy excess, but only with dignity. That is the subtly of the Law.

- 75. Aye! listen to the numbers & the words:
And here comes one of the greatest puzzles of the Book of the Law.

76. 4 6 3 8 A B K 2 4 A L G M O R 3 Y X 24 89 R P S T O V A L. What meaneth this, o prophet? Thou knowest not; nor shalt thou know ever. There cometh one to follow thee: he shall expound it. But remember, o chose none, to be me; to follow the love of Nu in the star-lit heaven; to look forth upon men, to tell them this glad word.
Crowley will never understand this, says Aiwass / Hadit. Another will come to interpret this mystery (sometimes called the ‚ÄúRiddle of AL‚Äú).

According to one translation, it reads: ‚ÄúFather (of) Manhood and Sexuality! O King (of) Fortune! Mighty (Beast) 666! The Second (Beast) (is come to) manhood, the youth [or child], the Perfection, the Fulfillment (of the promise), O King! Master (of the Temple), Anointed One (who hath achieved) Hadith, (long) implored, called upon and invoked, (in the name of) Athoth (shut up in silence). Tier of this Gordian Knot, the Antichrist, (thy) most Beloved One, the second beast, (thy Sword, the Sword of Horus, is here!)‚Äù

But there are many more interpretations out there. I just didn‚Äôt want to leave the reader disappointed that I left this blank.

- 1. Abrahadabra; the reward of Ra Hoor Khut.
- Abrahadabra is the word of the Aeon, delivered by Horus as promised by Aiwass. Its sum is 418 and it has 11 letters (both numbers should make sense to you by now). It is a magickal formula with¬†[many interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahadabra). Of course, Thelemites would agree you can learn more by sussing out the meaning yourself.

- 2. There is division hither homeward; there is a word not known. Spelling is 
- defunct; all is not aught. Beware! Hold! Raise the spell of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!
   All is not all. Our forms of spelling and mathematics cannot fully comprehend what Horus is about to tell us.

- 3. Now let it be first understood that I am a god of War and of Vengeance. I shall deal hardly with them.
- Horus the child is a terrifying god of war. It‚Äôs also quite brilliant in that Crowley foresaw the New Aeon as a very difficult growing up process; rather than the light and love utopia of the New Ager‚Äôs Age of Aquarius.

- 11. This shall be your only proof. I forbid argument. Conquer! That is enough. I will make easy to you the abstruction from the ill-ordered house in the Victorious City. Thou shalt thyself convey it with worship, o prophet, though thou likest it not. Thou shalt have danger & trouble. Ra-Hoor-Khu is with thee. Worship me with fire & blood; worship me with swords & with spears. Let the woman be girt with a sword before me: let blood flow to my name. Trample down the Heathen; be upon them, o warrior, I will give you of their flesh to eat!
- The stele is proof enough. Horus again forbids Because and Reason. Then things turn eschatological. Horus will make Thelemites a force against the ill-ordered Vatican. There will be great danger. But don‚Äôt worry, Horus is with you. There will be blood, Horus commands it. The woman girt with sword could be the Whore of Babylon or phallic energy within women, the feminist movement, etc. Those opposing your True Will will be trampled. Of course, as with anything written by Crowley ‚Äì blood could very well mean semen. Often things like blood and death are used as symbols for sex magick.

- 19. That stele they shall call the Abomination of Desolation; count well its name, & it shall be to you as 718.
Thelema, as represented by the stele, will be called an abomination because it will decimate the false philosophies. 718 -> 7+1+8 = 16 -> 1+6 = 7 -> the chariot, the tarot for victory, security, drive.

20. Why? Because of the fall of Because, that he is not there again.
Horus will defeat Because. Magick transcends the restrictions of Because and Reason.

- 24. The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what.
Here we find the recipe for the Cakes of Light. Crowley believes that the sexual fluids contain magick and power; and that is the essential secret of all the worlds religions and rituals. Crowley believes that every part of the body (even the gross parts) are of the Gods. By feeding oneself Cakes of Light, the participant feeds their soul, finds connection with the divine through Left Hand Path-style rituals and breaks Restriction and Sin implanted biases.

The recipe calls for menstrual blood, semen and other less salacious ingredients.

- 44. But let her raise herself in pride! Let her follow me in my way! Let her work the work of wickedness! Let her kill her heart! Let her be loud and adulterous! Let her be covered with jewels, and rich garments, and let her be shameless before all men!
Revelation 17. The Scarlet Woman is the Whore of Babylon and indulges in the richest decadence and depravity.

45. Then will I lift her to pinnacles of power: then will I breed from her a child mightier than all the kings of the earth. I will fill her with joy: with my force shall she see & strike at the worship of Nu: she shall achieve Hadit.
The Scarlet Woman will give birth to the Antichrist.

- 47. This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine. Let him not seek to try: but one cometh after him, whence I say not, who shall discover the Key of it all. Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is a key also. And Abrahadabra. It shall be his child & that strangely. Let him not seek after this; for thereby alone can he fall from it.
Again Crowley talks about the secrets hidden in the shape of his letters. Of course, another will come an elucidate the Book and its mysteries. Aiwass goes on to offer a vague key for the operation.

- 49. I am in a secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods of men.
Horus is the the new secret fourfold word, thereby making tetragrammaton obsolete. Crowley then goes on to blasphemy the gods.

50. Curse them! Curse them! Curse them!

51. With my Hawk‚Äôs head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs upon the cross.
Horus the hawk claws out the eyes of Jesus. The dead-and-rising god is no more. Now is the time for Horus.

52. I flap my wings in the face of Mohammed & blind him.
Moving from Christianity to Islam. Horus seems to imply that Islam is a ‚Äúblind‚Äù theology.

53. With my claws I tear out the flesh of the Indian and the Buddhist, Mongol and Din.
As well as the eastern religions. In this, Horus seems to imply that the fleshly denials of the ascetic religions are in error. Instead, Thelema reveres the body rather than deny it.

54. Bahlasti! Ompehda! I spit on your crapulous creeds.
These ‚Äúcurse words‚Äù originally found in The Book of the Law. Crapulous means drunk and stumbling.

55. Let Mary inviolate be torn upon wheels: for her sake let all chaste women be utterly despised among you!
Blasphemy against the Virgin Mary. Curses chastity as a Restriction, therefore against the law of Thelema. Thelema is about love and union.

- 73. Paste the sheets from right to left and from top to bottom: then behold!
If you make a grid of all the pages from the Book of the Law, it should reveal some secret.
