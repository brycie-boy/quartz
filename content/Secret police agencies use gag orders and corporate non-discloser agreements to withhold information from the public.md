## Secret police agencies use gag orders and corporate non-discloser agreements to withhold information from the public

SInce the terrorist attacks of 9/11, FBI and NSA National Security letters demanding surveillence information from various companies have regurlarly come with gag orders attached. Those who recieve such a letter are prohibited talking, even in general terms, about it. That makes it much harder to fight the letters in court. Governments are also hiding behind corperate non-discloser agreements. That's the reason the FBI and local police give for not revealing the details of their Stingray cell phone surveillence system. That's why the local police departments refuse to divulge details of the commercially developed policing algorithms they use to deploy officers.
