## People with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response

[Glucocorticoid]() levels are typically abnormal in people who are clinically [depressed](Depression.md). A relatively infrequent subtype of [depression](Depression.md), called ‚Äúatypical [depression](Depression.md),‚Äù is dominated by the psychomotor features of the disease‚Äîan incapacitating physical and psychological exhaustion. Just as is the case with chronic fatigue syndrome, atypical [depression](Depression.md) is characterized by lower than normal [glucocorticoid]() levels. However, the far more common feature of [depression](Depression.md) is one of an overactive [stress-response](Stress-response.md)‚Äîsomewhat of an overly activated [sympathetic nervous system](Sympathetic%20nervous%20system.md) and, even more dramatically, elevated levels of [glucocorticoid]()s. This is probably worse for those who have experienced some for of childhood neglect, since [a stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life](A%20stressful%20childhood%20can%20result%20in%20an%20overactive%20stress%20response%20in%20later%20life.md). This adds to the picture that [depressed](Depression.md) people, sitting on the edge of their beds without the energy to get up, are actually vigilant and aroused, with a [hormonal]() profile to match‚Äîbut the battle is inside them.

Research stretching back some forty years has explored why, on a nuts-and-bolts level, [glucocorticoid]() levels are often elevated in [depression](Depression.md). The elevated levels appear to be due to too much of a stress signal from the [brain](Brain.md), rather than the [adrenal gland]()s just getting some depressive [glucocorticoid]() hiccup all on their own now and then. Moreover, the excessive secretion of [glucocorticoid]()s is due to what is called feedback resistance‚Äîin other words, the [brain](Brain.md) is less effective than it should be at shutting down [glucocorticoid]() secretion. Normally, the levels of this [hormone]() are tightly regulated‚Äîthe [brain](Brain.md) senses circulating [glucocorticoid]() levels, and if they get higher than desired (the ‚Äúdesired‚Äù level shifts depending on whether events are calm or stressful), the [brain](Brain.md) stops secreting [glucocorticoid]()s. Just like the regulation of water in a toilet bowl tank. In [depressives](Depression.md), this feedback regulation fails‚Äîconcentrations of circulating [glucocorticoid]()s that should shut down the system fail to do so, as the [brain](Brain.md) does not sense the feedback signal.
