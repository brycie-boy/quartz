## The right hemisphere is able to use the left hemispheres style of cognition, but the left cannot use the rights

The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)s more flexible style is evidenced not just in its own preferences, but also at the ‘meta’ level, in the fact that it can also use the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)'s preferred style, whereas the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) cannot use the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s. For example, although the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) gains more benefit from a single strong association than several weaker associations, only the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) can use either equally.
