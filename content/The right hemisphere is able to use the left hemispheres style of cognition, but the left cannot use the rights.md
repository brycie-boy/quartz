## The right hemisphere is able to use the left hemispheres style of cognition, but the left cannot use the rights  # 

The [[right hemisphere]]s more flexible style is evidenced not just in its own preferences, but also at the ‘meta’ level, in the fact that it can also use the [[left hemisphere]]'s preferred style, whereas the [[left hemisphere]] cannot use the [[right hemisphere]]'s. For example, although the [[left hemisphere]] gains more benefit from a single strong association than several weaker associations, only the [[right hemisphere]] can use either equally.
