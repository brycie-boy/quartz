## People are for forgiving to in-group members for violating a norm # 

People are more likely to make amends for transgressions against [[In-group and out-group|Us]] than against [[In-group and out-group|Them]]. What about responses to other [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] members violating a norm? Most common is forgiving Us more readily than [[In-group and out-group|Them]]. This is often rationalized—we screw up because of special circumstances; [[In-group and out-group|They]] screw up because that’s how [[In-group and out-group|They]] are. Something interesting can happen when someone’s transgression constitutes airing the group’s dirty laundry that affirms a negative stereotype. The resulting [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] shame can provoke high levels of punishment as a signal to outsiders.
