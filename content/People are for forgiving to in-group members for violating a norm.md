## People are for forgiving to in-group members for violating a norm

People are more likely to make amends for transgressions against [Us](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) than against [Them](In-group%20and%20out-group.md). What about responses to other [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) members violating a norm? Most common is forgiving Us more readily than [Them](In-group%20and%20out-group.md). This is often rationalized‚Äîwe screw up because of special circumstances; [They](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) screw up because that‚Äôs how [They](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) are. Something interesting can happen when someone‚Äôs transgression constitutes airing the group‚Äôs dirty laundry that affirms a negative stereotype. The resulting [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) shame can provoke high levels of punishment as a signal to outsiders.
