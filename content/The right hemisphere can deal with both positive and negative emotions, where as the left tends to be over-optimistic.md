## The right hemisphere can deal with both positive and negative emotions, where as the left tends to be over-optimistic

The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is more in tune with sadness, and less with anger, than the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md); and that what we call positive emotions rely on both. While the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is associated with positive affect in many cases, and may even be the principle source of pleasurable experience, it is in general the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) that tends to take a more optimistic view of the self and the future. In fact there is evidence that it may take an unwarrantedly optimistic view.

Once again the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s range is more inclusive (it can deal with either), and the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)'s more partial. It is believed that the emotions which are related to bonding and empathy, whether ‘positive’ or ‘negative’, are preferentially treated by the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), as one would expect: such stimuli capture [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) attention. By the same token, those to do with competition, rivalry and individual self-belief, positive or negative, would be preferentially treated by the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md).
