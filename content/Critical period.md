## Critical period

* The critical period is a maturational stage in the lifespan of an organism during which the nervous system is especially sensitive to certain environmental stimuli. If, for some reason, the organism does not receive the appropriate stimulus during this "critical period" to learn a given skill or trait, it may be difficult, ultimately less successful, or even impossible, to develop certain associated functions later in life.
* A critical period is a window in which environmental input is necessary for the appropriate development of the relevant brain circuit. During a critical period, the brain has a heightened plasticity in which experiences have robust effects on establishing stable neurocircuitry. During this developmental period, the brain’s malleability creates both a vulnerability to environmental insults or deprivations as well as a remarkable ability to quickly and robustly acquire skills. After the closure of critical periods, neuronal changes are still possible, but more restricted.
* During critical periods of plasticity, ectopic synaptic connections are then pruned in an activity-dependent manner,
* After CP closure, a range of functional and structural elements prevent passive experience from eliciting significant plastic changes in the brain
