## The strength of the connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex determines a person‚Äôs level of emotional reactivity

The stronger the [synaptic](Synapse.md) connections between the [amygdala](Amygdala.md) and the [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md), the less a person will be hijacked by emotional downs and ups of all sorts. This connectivity modulates a person‚Äôs level of emotional reactivity: the stronger the link, the less reactive. Indeed, that relationship is so strong that a person‚Äôs reactivity level can be predicted by the connectivity. Meditation has been shown to strengthen this connection: [the brains of seasoned meditators have been shown to have stronger connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex](The%20brains%20of%20seasoned%20meditators%20have%20been%20shown%20to%20have%20stronger%20connections%20between%20the%20amygdala%20and%20the%20prefrontal%20cortex.md)
