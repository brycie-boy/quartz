## Existentialist consciousness

In existentialist consciousness, we are [model agnostic](Model%20Agnosticism.md) and consciously recognize our models as our creations ([when we recognize the gamble in every perception, we realize the active and creative nature of our consciousness](When%20we%20recognize%20the%20gamble%20in%20every%20perception,%20we%20realize%20the%20active%20and%20creative%20nature%20of%20our%20consciousness.md)). In this state, we are model-relativists and actively create. We are actively aware that [each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty](Each%20perception%20that%20we%20make%20is%20best%20considered%20to%20be%20a%20gamble%20rather%20than%20a%20certainty.md). We consciously seek to edit less and tune in more. And we actively [Actively try to confront information that is opposed to your beliefs and expectations](Actively%20try%20to%20confront%20information%20that%20is%20opposed%20to%20your%20beliefs%20and%20expectations.md), since they will teach us to make better models tomorrow, and an even better one the day after. We are not dominated by the "real" universe since we remember that the model is just our latest gamble and we can make a better one quickly. 

Existentialist consciousness involves the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), since [the left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20be%20stubbornly%20certain,%20whereas%20the%20right%20acknowledges%20ambiguity%20and%20is%20always%20uncertain.md), and also because [The right hemisphere can juggle multiple ambiguous possibilities and interpretations, whereas the left hemisphere jumps to premature conclusions](The%20right%20hemisphere%20can%20juggle%20multiple%20ambiguous%20possibilities%20and%20interpretations,%20whereas%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20jumps%20to%20premature%20conclusions.md).
