#### Notes

Amount: 12

- [[Capitalism forces the worker to give up much of what they produce]]
- [[Since every creation is the culmination of countless contributors, no single individual should be able to claim it as their own]]
- [[Humanity is only poor because the products of our labor are seized by a few owners]]
- [[People go without because the bourgeois will limit production in order to keep prices up]]
- [[A lot of work in a capitalist system is wasted on useless products]]
- [[A lot of the means of production stand idle because people can't get those jobs]]
- [[Capital and the means of production must become common property in order to achieve well being for all]]
- [[Every product is to some extent dependent on the external community]]
- [[A communist society would be forced to immediately abandon all wage systems]]
- [[Communist tendencies can be seen in all individualist societies]]
- [[Individualist societies still have many services that do not measure individual consumption or contribution to society before use]]
- [[Organization would be more efficient and less constraining without government intervention]]
