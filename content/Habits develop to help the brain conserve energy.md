## Habits develop to help the brain conserve energy # 

[[Habit]]s develop because the [[brain]] is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the [[basal ganglia]] will try to make almost any routine into a [[habit]], because [[habit]]s allow our minds to ramp down more often. This effort-saving instinct is a huge advantage. An efficient [[brain]] requires less room, which makes for a smaller head, which makes childbirth easier and therefore causes fewer infant and mother deaths. An efficient [[brain]] also allows us to stop thinking constantly about basic behaviors, such as walking and choosing what to eat, so we can devote mental energy to inventing spears, irrigation systems, and, eventually, airplanes and video games.
