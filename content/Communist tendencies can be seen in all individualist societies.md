## Communist tendencies can be seen in all individualist societies  # 

Not only is [[communism]] desirable, but even our existing societies, which are founded on individualism, are inevitably impelled in the direction of [[communism]]. The development of individualism can be explained by the efforts of the individual to protect themsleves from the tyranny of [[capital]] and of the [[state]]. For a time they imagined, and those who expressed their thought for them declared, that they could free themselves entirely from the [[state]] and from society. "By means of money I can buy all that I need," they said. But the individual was on a wrong track, because without the help of all, they cannot accomplish very much. In fact, along with this current of individualism, we find in all modern history a tendency, on the one hand, to retain all that remains of the partial [[communism]] of antiquity, and, on the other, to establish the [[Communism|communist]] principle in many developments of modern life.

New organizations, based on the same principle‚Äîto every man according to his needs‚Äîspring up under many different forms, and without a certain degree of [[communism]] the present societies could not exist. Despite the narrowly individualistic leaning that prevails within our [[Capitalism|capitalist]] commercial system, the tendency towards [[communism]] is constantly appearing, and it influences our activities in a variety of ways. Roads, for the most part, have become public property. Museums, free libraries, free schools, free meals for children; parks and gardens are open to all: streets paved and lighted, free to all; water supplied to every house‚Äîall such arrangements are founded on the principle: ‚ÄòTake what you need.‚Äô
