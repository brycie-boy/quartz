## Communist tendencies can be seen in all individualist societies

Not only is [communism](Communism.md) desirable, but even our existing societies, which are founded on individualism, are inevitably impelled in the direction of [communism](Communism.md). The development of individualism can be explained by the efforts of the individual to protect themsleves from the tyranny of [capital](Capital.md) and of the [state](). For a time they imagined, and those who expressed their thought for them declared, that they could free themselves entirely from the [state]() and from society. "By means of money I can buy all that I need," they said. But the individual was on a wrong track, because without the help of all, they cannot accomplish very much. In fact, along with this current of individualism, we find in all modern history a tendency, on the one hand, to retain all that remains of the partial [communism](Communism.md) of antiquity, and, on the other, to establish the [communist](Communism.md) principle in many developments of modern life.

New organizations, based on the same principle‚Äîto every man according to his needs‚Äîspring up under many different forms, and without a certain degree of [communism](Communism.md) the present societies could not exist. Despite the narrowly individualistic leaning that prevails within our [capitalist](Capitalism.md) commercial system, the tendency towards [communism](Communism.md) is constantly appearing, and it influences our activities in a variety of ways. Roads, for the most part, have become public property. Museums, free libraries, free schools, free meals for children; parks and gardens are open to all: streets paved and lighted, free to all; water supplied to every house‚Äîall such arrangements are founded on the principle: ‚ÄòTake what you need.‚Äô
