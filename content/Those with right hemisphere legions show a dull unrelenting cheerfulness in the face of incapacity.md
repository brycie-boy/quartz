## Those with right hemisphere legions show a dull unrelenting cheerfulness in the face of incapacity

Not only do [those with damage to the right hemisphere lack insight into illness or even denial of it](Those%20with%20damage%20to%20the%20right%20hemisphere%20lack%20insight%20into%20illness%20or%20even%20denial%20of%20it.md). In [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) lesions, there is not only denial or indifference in the face of incapacity, but sometimes a disturbance of mood ‚Äòreminiscent of the fatuousness of those with frontal lesions: euphoria, joviality, a penchant for feeble puns‚Äô. Remember that [the right frontal lobe has a depressive stance, where as the left shows undue cheerfulness](The%20right%20frontal%20lobe%20has%20a%20depressive%20stance,%20where%20as%20the%20left%20shows%20undue%20cheerfulness.md). One of the patients reported by H√©caen and de Ajuriaguerra, who had complete hemi-[asomatognosia]() caused by a parietal tumour ‚Äòexhibited a surprising joviality, at the same time complaining of a fierce headache.‚Äô
