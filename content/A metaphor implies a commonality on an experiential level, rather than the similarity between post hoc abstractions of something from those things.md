## A metaphor implies a commonality on an experiential level, rather than the similarity between post hoc abstractions of something from those things

[Every word is metaphorically linked to the something in the lived world](Every%20word%20is%20metaphorically%20linked%20to%20the%20something%20in%20the%20lived%20world.md). It must be emphasized, however, that a metaphor asserts a common life that is experienced in the body of the one who makes it, and the separation is only present at the linguistic level. Our sense of the commonality of the two ideas, perceptions or entities does not lie in a post hoc derivation of something abstracted from each of them, which is found on subsequent comparison to be similar, or even one and the same thing; but rather on a single concrete, kinaesthetic experience more fundamental than either, and from which they in turn are derived. Thus a clash of arguments and a clash of cymbals are not seen to have something in common only after the disembodied idea of a ‚Äòclash‚Äô is abstracted from the one and from the other, and found ‚Äì aha! ‚Äì to be similar; it is rather that these experiences ‚Äì a clash of arguments and a clash of cymbals, or, for that matter, a clash of swords, or a clash of colors ‚Äì are felt in our embodied selves as sharing a common nature.
