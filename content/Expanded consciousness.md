## Expanded consciousness

Expanded consciousness occurs with states such as [the three wholesome roots](The%20three%20wholesome%20roots.md), gratefulness, or when being open to feelings, people and nature. This feeling is often accompanied by a diminution of [ego](Ego.md), as well as a falloff in the attention paid to past and future on which the [ego](Ego.md) feasts. It is correlated with a drop in activity the [posterior cingulate cortex](Posterior%20cingulate%20cortex.md) and increase of activity in the [parasympathetic nervous system](Parasympathetic%20nervous%20system.md). It contrasts with [contracted consciousness](Contracted%20consciousness.md).
