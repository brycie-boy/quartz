## Psychedelic  # 

Psychedelics are a group of [[tryptamine]]s which have a strong affinity with one particular type of [[serotonin]] [[receptor]], called the [[5-HT2A]]. These [[receptor]]s are found in large numbers in the [[cortex]]. Psychedelics resemble [[serotonin]] closely enough that they can attach themselves to this [[receptor]] site in such a way as to activate it to do various things. Psychedelics effects are primarily the result of a reduction of [[brain]] activity, with the falloff concentrated paticularly in the [[default mode network]].
