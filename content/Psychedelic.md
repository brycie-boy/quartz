## Psychedelic

Psychedelics are a group of [tryptamine](Tryptamine.md)s which have a strong affinity with one particular type of [serotonin](Serotonin.md) [receptor](Receptor.md), called the [5-HT2A](). These [receptor](Receptor.md)s are found in large numbers in the [cortex](). Psychedelics resemble [serotonin](Serotonin.md) closely enough that they can attach themselves to this [receptor](Receptor.md) site in such a way as to activate it to do various things. Psychedelics effects are primarily the result of a reduction of [brain](Brain.md) activity, with the falloff concentrated paticularly in the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md).
