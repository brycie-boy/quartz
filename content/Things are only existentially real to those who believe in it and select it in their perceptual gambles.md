## Things are only existentially real to those who believe in it and select it in their perceptual gambles  # 

The fact that [[when we recognize the gamble in every perception, we realize the active and creative nature of our consciousness]] leads us to a similar conclusion of quantum physics: what ever we are talking about. our mind has been its principle architect. "Nothing is real and everything is real." as physicist [[John Gribbin]] says. That is, nothing is absolutely real in the metaphysical sense, and everything is experienced reality to those who believe in it and select it in their perceptual gambles. 

If we recognize the validity in these observations and we try to wake ourselves from the hypnotic trance of modeltheism‚ÄîIf we try to recall, moment by moment, in an ordinary day that the "real" universe is only a model that we have created and that existential experience cannot be compressed into one model ([[the finite models of the universe that we cling to lead us to discard the infinity of existential reality]])‚Äîwe enter a new kind of [[consciousness]]. What [[William Blake]] called "single vision" turns into multi-vision‚Äîinto conscious bet making. The person then sees the [[emptiness]] of all phenomena. Or as Blake puts it more positively, you "Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand, And Eternity in an hour." The world is not as finite, or static, or tidy, as the trance called the "real" universe. Like [[Godel's Incompleteness theorem]], it contains an [[infinite regress]]. Using [[The four corners]], the other person and indeed the whole continuum of experience now seems to "be" X and not-X and both X and not-X and neither X nor not-X. All that seems like relative certainty is what ever i think i "know" about a person or the world is just my latest gamble.
