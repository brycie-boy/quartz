The  
only enhanced GM volume in the meta-analysis of Nakao  
et al. [26] in ADHD patients relative to controls was in the pre-cuneus, which is part of the default mode network (DMN).  
The DMN consists of intercorrelated coactivation of medial  
frontal lobe, anterior and posterior cingulate and inferior tem-poral and parietal areas during rest that are parametrically attenu-ated during cognitive load, presumably reflecting increases in  
attentional and computational resources that impinge upon  
task-unrelated thoughts and processes. The DMN is therefore  
thought to reflect self-referential and stimulus-independent  
thought processes that need to be switched off for successful cog-nitive functioning, which is shown by increased attentional lapses  
being associated with failure to inhibit the DMN [29]. ADHD  
patients have shown to have more attentional lapses and attenu-ated deactivation of the DMN during attention tasks [30â€“32].  
The enlarged volume size may hence potentially be a plastic  
consequence of enhanced DMN activation (i.e., diminished  
deactivation).

Functional MRI studies

Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have provided consistent evi-dence for fronto-striatal, fronto-parietal and fronto-cerebellar  
deficits in ADHD during tasks of cognitive control. Further-more, there is some emerging, but less consistent evidence for  
fronto-limbic abnormalities in the context of reward processing.  
Several meta-analyses of whole-brain fMRI studies of EF and  
timing tasks have been published recently. They showed cogni-tive domain-specific fronto-striatal, fronto-parietal and fronto-cerebellar brain dysfunctions in ADHD. Thus, a meta-analysis  
of 21 whole-brain fMRI studies of cognitive and motor inhibi-tion, including 7 adult and 14 pediatric studies, showed that  
287 ADHD patients relative to 320 healthy controls had con-sistently reduced activation in key regions of motor response  
inhibition, in right IFC, supplementary motor area (SMA),  
ACC, left striatum and right thalamus (FIGURE 1 A)[51]. When  
inhibition tasks were split into motor response and interference  
inhibition, the reduced activations were more prominently right  
hemispheric and in the SMA for motor response inhibition,  
while for tasks of interference inhibition, left ACC dysfunction  
was more prominent in line with the prominent role of the  
SMA for motor inhibition and the ACC for interference inhi-bition, respectively [51]. A meta-analysis on attention tasks  
included mostly 13 pediatric whole-brain fMRI studies on a  
relatively wide range of attention tasks such as selective, divided

corroborate this hypothesis.

The timing meta-analysis in addi-tion also showed increased activation in ADHD patients in  
default mode regions, the PCC and precuneus (FIGURE 1 C)[31].  
This was also found in a parametric task design fMRI study  
where ADHD adolescents, unlike controls, did not progres-sively deactivate the precuneus with increasing attention load;  
and furthermore, this was inversely associated with performance  
and decreased fronto-striatal activation [30]. Problems to deacti-vate the DMN have been associated with more attention lapses,  
both in normal development and in ADHD [32] and could also  
reflect a developmentally delayed stage in attention process-i ng[4]. Both the problematic deactivation of the DMN con-comitant with poor activation of task relevant and age-correlated brain activation may hence reflect a developmental  
delay of brain function and both are likely underlying the poor  
performance in ADHD on attention-demanding higher level  
cognitive tasks.

enhanced activation was  
observed predominantly in default mode regions as well as in

there is  
evidence for abnormally enhanced gray matter and function in  
posterior regions of the default mode network. Evidence for  
reduced anticorrelation between task-positive fronto-striatal/  
fronto-cerebellar networks and the default mode network  
suggests that both poor task-positive activation and reduced  
deactivation of the default mode network underlie poor cognitive  
functioning in ADHD.
