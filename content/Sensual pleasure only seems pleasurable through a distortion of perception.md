## Sensual pleasure only seems pleasurable through a distortion of perception

Using [the three standpoints](The%20three%20standpoints.md), we can see that sensual pleasures only seem pleasurable through the distortion of [perception](Perception.md). When seen correctly, we see that they are actually painful. To demonstrate this, [the Buddha]() used a example of a leper scratching his scabs and causterizing his body over a charcoal pit. if such a man were to be given medicine that healed him, he would not envy another leper for having medicine because without the illness, there would be no need for medicine. Nor would the healed man envy another leper for his charcoal pit becuase he would then see the charcoal pit for what it really is, which is hot and painful. This charcoal pit was always painful, It was because the mans faculties were impared through the illness that he perceived the charcoal pit as pleasant. So too, people who are overwhelmed by [craving](Craving.md)s have there faculties impaired and cannot see sensual pleasures as they really are, which is painful. If the leper were to continue to give in to the urges to scratch at his scabs and causterize his body, the worse his injuries would become, and the stonger his urge to continue would become. So too, for people dependant on sensual pleasure, the more they indulge, the more [tolerance](Tolerance.md) they develop, the more their [craving](Craving.md) increases, the worse the [withdrawl](Withdrawl.md)s become, and the more they are, as [the Buddha]() says, "burned by the fever for sensual pleasure."
