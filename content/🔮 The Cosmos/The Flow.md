> _“The Way of the sage is work without effort”_

The ultimate goal i had for [🔮 The Cosmos](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Cosmos.md) was to create an efficient learning, thinking, and teaching experience that aligns with the principle of [[non-forcing]]. To accomplish this, i developed The Flow. In The Flow, notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time across projects, hence the name Flow which emphasizes its ever-evolving nature. This method allows me [[focus on systems instead of goals]]. This is an usual way to think about writing notes: [[Most people take only transient notes]]. The Flow is diametrically apposed to this—this practice is not about just writing notes, it is about effectively developing insight: [[Better note taking misses the point; what matters is better thinking]]. 

The Flow has 3 main stages:

1. [[Ingestion]]
2. [[Digestion]]
3. [[Egestion]]
