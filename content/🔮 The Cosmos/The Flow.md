The ultimate goal i had for [🔮 The Cosmos](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Cosmos.md) was to create an efficient learning, thinking, and teaching experience that aligns with the principle of [non-forcing](../Non-forcing.md). To accomplish this, i developed The Flow. [🔮 The Cosmos](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Cosmos.md) consists of a collection of notes which are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time across projects. This allows me [focus on systems instead of goals](../Focus%20on%20systems%20instead%20of%20goals.md). This is an usual way to think about writing notes: [Most people take only transient notes](../Most%20people%20take%20only%20transient%20notes.md). The Flow is diametrically apposed to this—this practice is not about just writing notes, it is about effectively developing insight: [Better note taking misses the point; what matters is better thinking](../Better%20note%20taking%20misses%20the%20point;%20what%20matters%20is%20better%20thinking.md). 

The Flow has 3 main stages:

1. [Ingestion](../Ingestion.md)
1. [Digestion](../Digestion.md)
1. [Egestion](../Egestion.md)
