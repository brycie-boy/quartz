Greetings traveler!👋 My name is [[Bryce McAlister]]. You have happened to stumble across The Cosmos. The Cosmos is, in short, my thinking, learning and writing environment. It is also my [[reality labyrinth]]. This is primarily where i engage in [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit exercises]]. Or in other words, It is here that I dive into the depths of the chaotic universe that is my mind and attempt to emerge with coherent insights to share with the world.

Here are some places where you can take a deeper look into The Cosmos:
