## Mechanic mode

In mechanic mode, we are unobservant and unable to [jump out of the system](Jump%20out%20of%20the%20system.md). We are limited to [low-temperature search](Low-temperature%20search.md)es, and thus can only operate strictly within the predetermined rules of a system, and we are willing to wait an infinite length of time for an answer. I believe mechanic mode to be characteristic of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) since [when solving problems, the left hemisphere tends to rely on a single solution that fits what it already knows](When%20solving%20problems,%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20rely%20on%20a%20single%20solution%20that%20fits%20what%20it%20already%20knows.md).
