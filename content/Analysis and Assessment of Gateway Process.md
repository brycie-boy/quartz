Hypnosis. According to the theories of psychologist Ronald Stone and the biomedicalengineering models of Itshak Bento, hypnosis i s basically a technique which permits acquisition of direct access to the sensory motor cortex and pleasure centers, and lower cerebral(emotional) portions(and associated pleasure centers) of the right side of the human brain following successful disengagement of the stimulus screening function of the left hemisphere of the brain. The left hemisphere of the brain is the self-cognitive, verbal and linear reasoning component of the mind. I t fulfills the function of screening incoming stimuli by categorizing, assessing and assigning meaning prior t o allowing passage t o the right hemisphere of the mind. The right hemisphere, which functions as the noncritical, holistic, nonverbal and pattern-oriented component of the brain appears t o accept what the left hemisphere passes to it without question. Consequently, i f the l e f t hemisphere can be distracted either through boredom or through reduction to a soporific, semi-sleep state, external stimuli to include hypnotic suggestions are allowed to pass unchallenged into the right hemisphere where they are accepted and acted upon directly. The result may involve an emotional reaction originating in the lower cerebral region, sensory/motor responses requiring involvement of the cortex, and so on. Both the sensory and the motor cortices of the right cerebral portion of the brain contain a sequence of points known as the "homunculus" which corresponds to points in the body(see Exhibit 1, next page). Stimulation of the corresponding area on the cortex causes intermediate response in the associated portion of the body. Consequently, induction of the suggestion that the left leg is numb, if it reaches the right hemisphere unchallenged and is referred to the appropriate area of the sensory cortex, will result in an electrical reaction being generated that will induce the feeling of numbness. Similarly, the suggestion that the person is experiencing a general feeling of happiness and well being would be referred to the appropriate pleasure centers located in the lower cerebral portion or in the cortex of the right hemisphere, thereby inducing the suggested feeling of euphoria. Finally, suggestions such as one that informs the hypnotic subject that he enjoys enhanced concentration or powers of memory would be responded to in the right hemisphere by accessing unused information storage capacity normally held in reserve as a result of left hemisphere selection and control processes. This aspect will become significant in the context of the Gateway process when attention is given to examining the way that hypnosis may be used to accelerate progress in the early stages of the Gateway Experience.

Transcendental Meditation. On the other hand, transcendental meditation works in a distinctlydifferent fashion. In this technigue, intense and protracted single minded concentration on the process of drawing energy up the spinal cord ultimately results in what appears to be creation of acoustical standing waves in the cerebral ventricles which are then conducted to the gray matter in the cerebral cortex on the right side of the brain. As a result, according to Bentov, these waves "will stimulate and eventually 'polarize' the cortex in such a way that it will tend to conduct a signal along the homunculus, starting from the toes and on u p . " t h e mentovbio-medical model, as described in a book by Lee Sannella, M. D., entitled: Kundalini-Psychosis or Transcendence, states that the standing acoustical waves are t h er e s u l to f t h e altered rhythm of heart sounds which are occasioned by prolonged practice of meditation, and which set up sympathetic vibrations in the walls of the fluid filled cavities which comprise the third and lateral ventricles of the brain. In addition, according to Bento: "The states of bliss described by those whose Kundalini symptoms have completed the full loop along the hemispheres may be explained as a self-stimulation of the pleasure centers in the brain caused by the circulation of a 'current' along the sensory cortex." Bentov also notes, "that most of the described symptoms start on the left side of the body means that i t is mostly a development occurring in the right hemisphere." Although normally a period of meditation involving intense concentration and practice for five years or some is required to "bring up the Kundalini," Bentov states that exposure to mechanical or acoustical vibrations in the range of 4-7 Hertz(cycles per second) for protracted periods may achieve the same effect. Bentov cites as an example "repeated riding in a car whose suspension and seat combination produce that range of vibrations, or being exposed for long periods of time to these frequencies caused, for instance, by an air conditioning duct." He also notes that: "The cumulative effect of these vibrations may be able to trigger a spontaneous physio-Kundalini sequence in susceptable people who have a particularly sensitive nervous system."

Biofeedback. mhe third consciousness altering methodology which will be brieflydescribed is biofeedback. Biofeedback is somewhat unique in that it actually employs the self-cognitive powers of the left hemisphere to gain access to such areas of the right brain as the lower cerebral, motor and sensory cortices and assorted pain or pleasure centers. Instead of suppressing the left hemisphere as is done in hypnosis, or largely bypassing and ignoring it as is done in transcendental meditation, biofeedback teaches the left hemisphere first to visualize the desired result and then to recognize the feelings associated with the experience of successful right hemisphere access to the specific lower cerebral, cortex, pain or pleasure or other areas in the manner needed to produce the desired result. Special self-monitoring devices such as the digital thermometer are used to inform the left brain when i t succeeds in keying the right hemisphere into accessing the appropriate area. Once this is done, the left brain can then repeatedly instruct the right brain to reestablish the pathways involved so as to produce the same external, objective measures of success. In this way, the pathways are strengthened and emphasized to such an extent that left brain consciousness is enabled to access appropriate areas in the right brain using a conscious, demand mode. For example, if the subject wishes to increase the circulation in the left leg in order to speed up healing he may concentrate with his left brain on achieving that result while carefully monitoring a digital thermometer connected to the left leg. When the concentrated effort begins to achieve success, the digital thermometer will register an increase in the temperature of the left leg. At that point, the subject can mentally (left brain) associate the sensations experienced with the result achieved and can begin to emphasize, by memory recall, the same process to cause its strengthening by affirmation and repetition. In this way, pain can be blocked, healing can be enhanced, malignant tumors can apparently be suppressed and ultimately destroyed, the body's pleasure centers can be stimulated, and a variety of specific physiological results may be achieved. In addition, biofeedback may be used to greatly accelerate achievement of deep meditative states particularly for beginners methodology is enhanced through effective visualization and external, objective affirmation. Display of the subject's brainwave pattern on a cathode ray tube has proven to be a laboratory-validated means by which subjects may quickly learn to place themselves in profoundly relaxed states characterized by the sort of quietude and singularity of mental focus associated with advanced meditation.

Gateway and Hemi-Sync. Now that we have briefly profiled the basic mechanics of t h eprincipal techniques for altering or expanding consciousness which share some of the objectives and/or methods employed in the Gateway Experience, we may proceed to focus on what that technique actually involves. Fundamentally, the Gateway Experience is a training system designed to bring enhanced strength, focus and coherence to the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output between the left and right hemispheres so as to alter consciousness, moving it outside the physical sphere so as to ultimately escape even the restrictions of time and space. The participant then gains access to the various levels of intuitive knowledge which the universe offers. What differentiates the Gateway Experience from forms of meditation i s i t s use of the Hemi-Sync technique which is defined in a monograph by Monroe Institute trainer Melissa Jager as, "a state of consciousness defined when the EEG patterns of both hemispheres are simultaneously equal in amplitude and frequency." Although Hemi-Sync seems to be rather rare and of only short duration in ordinary human consciousness, Melissa Jager states that: "Audio techniques developed by Bob Monroe can induce and sustain Hemi-Sync with the Institute's basic Focus 3 tapes,..." She also notes that: "Studies conducted by Elmer and Alyce Greene at the Menninger Foundation have shown that a subject with 20 years of training in Zen meditation could consistently establish Hemi-Sync at will, sustaining it for over 15 minutes." Dr. Stuart Twemlow, a psychiatrist and a research associate of the Monroe Institute, reports that: "In our studies of the effect of the Monroe tape system on brainwaves, we have found that the tapes encourage the focusing of brain energy(it can be measured as with a lightbulb, in watts) into a narrower and narrower 'frequency band'. this focusing of energy is not unlike the yoga concept of one pointedness, which we may translate in western terms as a single-mindedness." Dr. Twemlow goes on to observe that as the individual gets into the tapes beyond Focus 3, "...there is a gradual increase in brainwave size which is a measure of brain energy or power."

Lamp vs Laser: Melissa Jager uses a metaphor to help clarify the process involvedi nthe use of Hemi-Sync in the Gateway Experience. she points out that the human mind in its natural state may be likened to an ordinary lamp which expends energy in the form of both heat and light but in a chaotic, incoherent way which diffuses its energy over a wide area of rather limited depth. On the other hand, the human mind under the discipline of Hemi-Sync acts after the fashion of a laser beam which produces a disciplined stream of light. The stream of energy is projected with total coherence of both frequency and amplitude such that the surface area of a laser beam contains billions of times the concentrated energy found in a similar surface area on the sun. Gateway assumes that once the frequency and amplitude of the human brain are rendered coherent, it is possible to begin accelerating both so that the human mind is soon resonating at ever higher vibrational levels. The mind can then bring itself into sycronization with more sophisticated and rarified energy levels in the universe. The mind, when operating at these increasingly rarified levels is assumed to be capable of processing the information thus received through the same fundamental matrix by which i t makes sense of ordinary physical sensory input to achieve meaning in a cognitive context. Such meaning is usually perceived visually in the form of symbols but may also be perceived as astonishing flashes of holistic intuition or even in the form. of scenarios involving both visual and aural perception. The mechanics by which the mind exercises the consciousness function will be addressed in more detail later in this paper.

FrequencyFollowing Response. To achieve synchronization of brain hemispheres, the Hemi-synctechniquet a k e sadvantage of a phenomenon known as the Frequency Following Response(FF) which means that if a subject hears a sound produced at a frequency which emulates one of those associated with the operation of the human brain, the brain will try to mimmick the same frequency pattern by adjusting its brainwave output. Therefore, if the subject is in a fully awake state but hears sound frequencies which approximates brainwave output at the Theta level, the subject's brain will endeavor to alter its brainwave pattern from the normal Beta to the Theta level. Since these brainwave frequencies are outside the spectrum of sounds which can be heard in pure form by the human ear, 'Hemi-sync must produce them based on another phenomenon known as the brain's capacity for deducing "beat" frequencies. I f the human brain i s exposed t o one frequency i n the left ear which is 10 Hertz below another audible frequency played in the right ear, rather than hearing either of the two audible frequencies, the brain chooses to "hear" the difference between them, the "beat" frequency. Thus, availing itself of the F F phenomenon, and using the technique of "beat" frequencies, the Gateway system uses Hemi-Sync and other audio techniques employing the F F phenomenon to introduce a variety of frequencies which are played at a virtually subliminal, marginally audible level. The objective is to relax the left hemisphere of the brain, place the physical body in a virtual sleep state, and bring the left and right hemispheres into coherence under conditions designed t o promote the production of ever higher amplitude and frequency of brainwave output. Audible and perhaps subliminal suggestions by Bob Monroe accompany the various brainwave frequencies, which are sometimes rolled in together with other sounds such as sea surf to mask the sound frequencies where desirable. In this way, Gateway endeavors to provide the subject with the tools by which he may alter his consciousness based on his own volition over time through the repetitive use of the tapes so as to access, via intuitive means, new categories of information not available to ordinary consciousness.

Role of Resonance. However, brain coherence through entrainment to "beat" frequencies introduced via stereo headphones is only part of the reason why the Gateway system works. It is also designed to achieve the physical quietude characteristic of deep transcendental meditative states which brings about a complete alteration of the fundamental resonance pattern associated with the sound frequencies produced by the human body. Yoga, zen or transcendental meditation, if practiced long enough, will produce a change in the sound frequency with which the human heart resonates throughout the entire body. According to Bentov, this change in resonance results from elimination of what the medical profession calls "the bifurcation echo" so that the sound of the heartbeat can move synchronously up and down the circulatory system in harmonious resonance approximately seven times a second. Bento describes the roll played by the bifurcation echo as follows:
"when the left ventricle of the heart ejects blood, the aorta, being elastic, balloons out just beyond the valve and causes a pressure pulse to travel down along the aorta. When the pressure pulse reaches the bifurcation in the lower abdomen (which is where the aorta forks in two to go into the legs), part of the pressure pulse rebounds and starts traveling up the aorta. If in the meantime the heart ejects more blood, and a new pressure pulse is traveling down, these two pressure points will eventually collide somewhere along the aorta and produce an interference pattern."
By placing the body in a sleeplike state, the Gateway tapes achieve the same goal as meditation in that i t places the body in such a profoundly relaxed state that the bifurcation echo slowly fades away as the heart lessens the force and frequency with which it pushes blood into the aorta. The result is a regular, rhythmic sinewave pattern of sound which echoes throughout the body and rises up into the head in sustained resonance. The amplitude of this sinewave pattern, when measured with a sensitive, seismograph type instrument is about three times the average of the sound volume produced by the heart when it is operating normally.

Brain Stimulation. Bentov's biomedical model shows that this resonance i s of considerable importance since it is directly transmitted to and impacts upon the brain. the resulting vibration is received and transmitted into the brain itself via the fluid filled third and left ventricles located above the brain stem. An electromagnetic pulse is then generated which stimulates the brain to raise the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output, just as Dr. Twemlow observed in his research on the effects of the Hemi-Sync tapes. Also, the brain is contained in a tight membrane called the dura which is, in turn, cushioned by a thin layer of fluid located between i t and the skull. As the coherent resonance produced by the human heart in a state of profound relaxation reaches the fluid layer surrounding the brain, it sets up a rhythmic pattern in which the brain moves up and down approximately 0.005 to 0.010 millimeters in a continuous pattern. The selfreinforcing character of resonant behavior accounts for the body's ability to sustain this movement despite the minimal level of energy involved. In this way, the entire body, based on its own micromotion, functions as a tuned vibrational system which transfers energy in a range of between 6.8 and 7.5 Hertz into the earth's ionospheric cavity, which itself resonates at about 7-7.5 Hertz. o f t h i s process, Bento states:

"This i s occurring a t a very long wavelength of about 40,000 Km, or j u s t about the perimeter of the planet.
In other words, the signal from the movement of our bodies will travel around the world in about one seventh of a second through the electrostatic field in which we are imbedded. Such a long wavelength knows no obstacles, and its strength does not attenuate much over large distances. Naturally it will go through just about anything: metal, concrete, water, and the f i e l d s making up our bodies. It is the ideal medium for conveying a telepathic signal."

Consequently, the Gateway process is designed to rather rapidly induce a state of profound calm within the nervous system and to significantly lower blood pressure to cause the circulatory system, skeleton and all other physical organ systems to begin vibrating coherently at approximately 7-7.5 cycles per second. The resulting resonance sets up a regular, repetitive sound wave which propagates in consonance with the elecrostatic field of the earth.

EnergyEntrainment. As the body i s turned into a coherent oscillator vibratingi nharmony with the surrounding electrostatic medium, the specific exercises included in the Gateway tapes enjoin the participant to build up the energy field surrounding his body, presumably by using energy from the earth's field which the body is now entraining because of its ability to resonate with it. This puts the body's energy field into homogeneity with its surrounding environment and promotes movement of the seat of consciousness into the surrounding environment partly in response to the fact that the two electromagnetic medians are now a single energy continuum.
Thus, the same process which moves the brain into focused coherence at steadily higher levels of frequency and amplitude so as to entrain analgous frequencies in the universe for data collection also promotes enhancement of bodily energy levels to a point adequate to permit the subject to experience an out-of-body movement when he is ready to do so(more will be said about this topic later). In addition, by resonating with the earth's electromagnetic sphere the human body creates a surprisingly powerful carrier wave to assist the mind in communication activity with other human minds similarly tuned.

Consciousness and Energy. Before our explanation can proceed any further, it is essential to define the mechanism by which the human mind exercises the function known as consciousness, and to describe the way in which that consciousness operates to deduce meaning from the stimuli which it receives. To do this, we will first consider the fundamental character of the material world in which we have our physical existence in order to accurately perceive the raw stuff with which our consciousness must work. the first point which needs to be made is that the two terms, matter and energy tend to be misleading if taken to indicate two distinctly different states of existence in the physical world that we know it. Indeed, if the term matter is taken to mean solid substance as opposed to energy which is understood to mean a force of some sort, then the use of the former is entirely misleading. Science now knows that both the electrons which spin in the energy field located around the nucleus of the atom and the nucleus itself are made up of nothing more than oscillating energy grids. Solid matter, in the strict construction of the term, simply does not exist. Rather, atomic structure is composed of oscillating energy grids surrounded by other oscillating energy grids which orbit at extraordinarily high speeds. In his book, Stalking the Wild composes" the hacieustor the aotm vAntatednat approximately 102% e r t a which means 10 followed by 22 zeros). At 70 degrees Farenheit an atom oscillates at the rate of 1015 Hertz. An entire molecule, composed of a number of atoms bound together
in a single energy field vibrates in the range of 109 Hertz. A live human cell vibratesat approximately 103 Hertz. The point to be made is that the entire
human being, brain, consciousness and all is, like the universe which surrounds him, nothing more or less than an extraordinarily complex system of energy fields. t h e so called states of matter are actually variances In the state of energy, and human consciousness is a function of the interaction of energy in two opposite states (motion vs rest) in a manner described in the following paragraph.

Holograms. Energy creates, stores and retrieves meaning in the universe by projecting or expanding at certain frequencies in a three dimensional mode that creates a living pattern called a hologram. The concept of the hologram can be most easily understood by using an example cited by Bentov in which he asks the reader to visualize a bowl full of water into which three pebbles are dropped. As the ripples created by the simultaneous entry of the three pebbles radiate outward towards the rim of the bowl, Bento further asks the reader to visualize that the surface of the water is suddenly flash frozen so that the ripple pattern 1s preserved instantly. The ice is removed leaving the three pebbles still laying at the bottom of the bowl. Then the ice is exposed to a powerful, coherent source of light, such as a laser. The result will be a three dimensional model or representation of the position of the three pebbles suspended in midair. Holograms are capable of encoding so much detail that, for example, i t is possiblet o take a holographic projection of a glass of swamp water and view i t under magnification to see small organisms not visible to the naked eye when the glass of water itself is examined. The whole concept of holography, despite its scientific implications,
has only been known to the physicist since the underlying mathmatical principles were worked out by Dennis Gabor in 1947(he later won a Nobel Prize for his work). Laboratory demonstration of Gabor's work only occurred years later following invention of the laser. As biologist Lyall Watson explains:

"rhe purest kind of light available to us is that produced by a laser, which sends out a beam in which all the waves are of one frequency, like those made by an ideal pebble in a perfect pond. When two laser beams touch, they produce an interference pattern of light and dark ripples that can be recorded on a photographic plate. And if one of the beams, instead of coming directly from the laser, is reflected first off an object such as a human face, the resulting pattern will be very complex indeed, but it can still be recorded. The record will be a hologram of the face."

The Part Encodes the Whole. of further importance is the fact that even if we dropped o u rfrozenhologramo f the ripple pattern on the floor and broke i t into a number of pieces each individual piece would recreate the entire holographic image all by itself. The smaller the piece, the fuzzier and more distorted would be the resulting holographic projection but the f a t remains that a whole projection would nonetheless be made.
The key to creating any hologram is that energy in motion must interact with energy in a state of rest(nonmotion). In the foregoing example, the pebbles represent energy in motion while the water (before i t s agitation by the pebbles) represents energy at a state of rest. To activate or, in effect, to "perceive" the meaning of a holograph, energy(in this case, a coherent light source such as a laser beam) must be passed through the interference pattern generated by interaction between the moving energy and the energy at rest. In the simple example given by Bento, this requirement was fulfilled by holding the frozen intorference pattern in front of the coherent light to project the three dimensional holographic image(its "meaning") into space. As Marilyn Ferguson, editor of the Brain/Mind Bulletin tells us:

"Another feature of a hologram is Its efficiency.
Billions of bits of information can be stored in a tiny space. The pattern of the holographic \[photograph\] ...is stored everywhere on the plate.

The ConsciousnessMatrix. The universe is composed of interacting energy fields, some at rest and some in motion. It is, in and of itself, one gigantic hologram of unbelievable complexity. According t o the theories of Karl Pribram, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and David Bohm, a physicist at the University of London, the human mind is also a hologram which attunes itself t o the universal hologram by the medium of energy exchange thereby deducing meaning and achieving the state which we call consciousness.  respect
to states of expanded or altered consciousness such as Gateway uses, the process operates in the following way. As energy passes through various aspects of the universal hologram and is perceived by the electrostatic fields which comprise the human mind, the holographic images being conveyed are projected upon those electrostatic fields of the mind and are perceived or understood to the extent that the electrostatic field is operating at a frequency and amplitude that can harmonize with and therefore "read" the energy carrier wave pattern passing through it. Changes in the frequency and amplitude of the electrostatic field which comprises the human mind determines the configuration and hence the character of the holographic energy matrix which the mind projects to intercept meaning directly from the holographic transmissions of the universe. Then, to make sense of what the holographic image is "saying" to it, the mind proceeds to compare the image just received with itself. Specifically, it does this by comparing the image received with that part of its own hologram which constitutes memory. By registering differences in geometric form and in energy frequency, the consciousness perceives (see Exhibit 2, next page). As psychologist Keith Floyd puts it:

"Contrary to what everyone knows is so, it may not be the brain that produces consciousness--but rather, consciousness that creates the appearance of the
brain..."

Brain in phase: The consciousness process is most easily envisaged if we picture the holographic input with a three dimensional grid system superimposed over it such that all of the energy patterns contained within can be described in
terms of three dimensional geometry using mathmatics to reduce the data to two dimensional form. Bentov states that scientists suspect that the human mind operates on a simple binary "go/no go" system as do all digital computers. Therefore, once it superimposes a three dimensional matrix over holographic information it wishes to interpret and reduces that information mathmatically to two dimensional form, it can completely process it using its fundamental binary system just as any computer made by the hand of man can process volumes of data and make various comparisons between the data and information stored in its digital
memory. Our minds operate in the same way, perceiving by comparison only. states the proposition this way: "Our whole reality is constructed by constantly making such comparisons....Whenever we perceive something, we always perceive differences only." In states of expanded consciousness, the right hemisphere of the human brain in its holistic, nonlinear and nonverbal mode of functioning acts as the primary matrix or receptor for this holographic input while, by operating in phase or coherence with the right brain, the left hemisphere provides the secondary
matrix through its binary, computer-like method of functioning to screen further the data by comparison and reduce it to a discreet, two dimensional form.

Evaluation. To the extent that Gateway succeeds in bringing about a refinement in energy matrix of the mind, it succeeds in expanding or altering human consciousness so that it can perceive without recourse to the intercession of the physical senses such that ever more of the universal hologram(not, of course, accessible by sense perception) can ultimately be perceived and understood.
Marilyn Ferguson has written that the theories of Pribram and Bohm "appear to account for all transcendental experience, paranormal events and even "normal" perceptual oddities..."
She goes on to say of Pribram:

"Currently he is proposing a startling, all-encompassing model that is generating considerable excitement among those intrigued by the mysteries of human consciousness. His "holographic model" marries brain research to theoretical physics; it accounts for normal perception and simultaneously takes the paranormal and transcendental experiences out of the supernatural by explaining them as a part of nature.
Like certain strange discoveries of quantum physics, the radical reorientation of this theory suddenly makes sense of paradoxical sayings of mystics
throughout the ages.

Self Cognition. To complete our outline of the process by which the mind achievesa n dexercises consciousness, we must also describe the mechanism which accounts for the aspect of human thought that differentiates i t from the consciousness of plants or animals, i.e. self cognition. Humans not only know, but they know that they know. They are able to monitor the process of their own thinking and maintain an awareness of i t . Moreover, they can conduct a comparitive assessment, evaluating the functioning of their thought processes against various "objective" standards they have adopted. Human consciousness can do this because i t has the capacity t o duplicate aspects of i t s own hologram, project them out, "perceive" that projection, put it through comparison with the memory aspect(where its evaluation standards of measure are stored) of its own hologram, and measure or "sense" the differences using three dimensional geo

Time-Space Dimension. Up to this point our discussion of the Gateway process has been relatively simple and easy to follow. Now the fun begins. Gateway involves more than just perception of those aspects of the universal hologram which can be accessed in the dimension of time-space as we know i t . To explain how and why human consciousness can be brought t o transcend the limitations of time-space is the next task which must be addressed. To do this we must first appreciate what time and space are in order to understand how the dimension that they constitute can be transcended. Physicists define time as a measurement of energy or force in motion. In other words, i t is a measurement of change. However, in order for energy to be in motion it must first be limited in some way within the confines of some sort of vibratory pattern so that its confinement gives it the capacity for being contained at a specific location which is distinguishable from other locations(space). Energy which is not confined is force without limit, without dimension, without the limits of form.
It is infinity, cannot move because there is nothing beyond infinity, and is therefore outside of the dimension of time.
It
is also beyond space because that concept implies that a specific energy form is limited to a specific location, and is absent from other locations. But if energy is in the state of infinity, there are no boundaries, no "here" to differentiate from "there", no sense of area. Energy in infinity means energy uniformly extended without
limit. I t has no beginning, no end, no location.

* t is
  conscious force,
  the fundamental, primal power of existence without form, a state of infinite
  being. Energy in infinity is said to be completely at rest and, therefore, cannot generate holograms so long as i t remains utterly inactive. I t retains i t s inherent capacity for consciousness in that it can receive and passively perceive holograms generated by energy in motion out in the various dimensions which make up the created universe but it cannot be perceived by consciousness operating in the active universe. Energy in this state of inactive infinity is termed by physicists as energy in its absolute state, or simply "the Absolute." Between the Absolute and t h e"material" universe in which we experience our physical existence are various intervening dimensions to which human consciousness in altered states of being may gain access. Theoretically, human consciousness may continue to expand the horizons of its perceptual capability until i t reaches the dimension of the Absolute at which point perception stops because the absolute generates no holograms about itself

Intervening dimensions. since the Absolute i s conscious energy i n infinity(i.e. without boundaries), i t occupies every dimension to include the time-space dimension in which we have our physical existence but we cannot perceive it. It overlays everything as do many of the intervening gradients or dimensions through which the energies of the universe pass on their way to and from their home in the state of infinity(the Absolute). To enter these intervening dimensions, human consciousness must focus with such intense coherence that the frequency of the energy pattern which comprises that consciousness(i.e. the brainwave output) can accelerate to the point where the resulting frequency pattern, if displayed on an oscilloscope, would look virtually like a solid line. Achievement of this state of altered consciousness sets the stage for perception of non-time-space dimensions because of the operation of a principle in physics known as Planck's Distance. This i s an aspect of quantum mechanics which applies to the fact t h a tany oscillating frequency(such as a brainwave) reaches two points of complete rest which constitute t h eboundaries of each individual oscillation(i.e. movement up or down). Without these points of rest, an oscillating wave pattern would be impossible since the points of rest are required to permit the energy to change direction and thus continue vibrating between rigid limits. But
it is also true that when, for an infinitesimally brief instant, that energy reaches one of i t s two points of rest it "clicks out" of time-space and joins infinity(see Exhibit 3, next page). That critical step out of time-space occurs when the speed of the oscillation drops below 10-33 centimeters per second(Plank's Distance). Touse
the words of Bentov: "...quantum mechanics tell us that when distances go below Planck's Distance, which is 10-33 CM, we enter, in effect, a new world."
To
return to our case in point, the human consciousness wave pattern reaches such high frequency that the pattern of "clickouts" comes so close together that there is virtual continuity in it. Then, a portion of that consciousness is actually postulated to establish and maintain its information collection function in those dimensions located between time-space and the Absolute. Thus, as the almost continuous "clickout" pattern establishes itself in continuous phase at speeds below Planck's Distance but before reaching the state of total rest, human consciousness passes through the looking glass of time-space after the fashion of Alice beginning her journey into wonderland. The Gateway experience,with its associated Hemi-synctechnique, is apparently designed, if used systematically and patiently, to enable human consciousness to establish a coherent pattern of perception i n those dimensions where speeds below P l a n k ' s distance apply. This holds true irrespective of whether the individual is exercising his consciousness while in his physical body or whether he is doing so after having separated that consciousness from the physical bodyi.e. the so called out-of-body state mentioned

SubatomicParticles. The behavior of subatomic particles provides an interestingexampleo f the phenomenon of "clicking out" discussed in the preceding paragraphs. In an article prepared for Science Digest magazine, Dr. John Gliedman mentions the way in which subatomic particles communicate with each other once their energy fields become entrained as a result of colliding with each other.
the communication concerned is, of course, postulated to be occurring during the "click out phase" in the oscillation of the energy fields comprising the subatomic particles concerned. It is this cause which accounts for the cross-communication at what in terms of time-space velocities, would seem to involve speeds in excess of light. In reality Einstein's Theory of Relativity is not being invalidated but, rather, the communication concerned is taking place outside the dimension of time-space to which the Theory of Relativity is strictly confined. Specifically, Dr. Gleidman tells us: "Quantum theory postulates a kind of long range Siamese twin effect whenever two subatomic particles collide and then go their different ways. Even when the particles are halfway across the universe from each other, it says, they instantaneously respond to each other's actions. And in so doing, they violate relativity's ban on faster than light velocities." Indeed, regarding attempts to quantify what is known about the behavior of energy in dimensions apparently outside of time-space, Bento speaks about, "...courageous physicists who are working on hypothetical particles, called 'tachyons, which can move at speeds higher than light.
The speed of tachyons starts just above the speed of light and ranges all the way to infinite velocities."

Dimensions In-between. Now that we have postulated the legitimacy of the assertion that the energy forms which compose consciousness can move beyond the time-space dimension, we need to turn our attention to the energy forms which inhabit those dimensions between time-space and the Absolute. In so doing, we may better perceive the form that "reality" assumes when we encounter it in those intermediate dimensions.
In this context, Bento tells us that:

"The causal relationship between events breaks down; movements become jerky rather than smooth. Time and space may become "grainy" or "chunky." Perhaps a piece of space can be traversed by a particle of matter in any direction without necessarily being synchronized with a piece of time. In short, a pair of events will occur in either time or space, the pair not being connected causally but by a random fluctuation."

What Bentov means is that inside the dimension of time-space where both concepts apply in a generally uniform way there i s a proportional relationship between
them. A certain space can be covered by energy moving in either particle or wave form in a certain time assuming a specific velocity virtually anywhere in the time-space universe.
The relationship is neat and predictable. However, in the intermediate dimensions beyond time-space the limitations imposed on energy t o put i t into a state of oscillating motion are not uniform as they are in our physical universe. A myriad of various distortions and incongruities are thus likely to be encountered such that our nice neat assumptions concerning the relationship between time and space as we know i t in t h i s dimension do not apply. But even more important, access is opened to both the past and the future when the dimension of current time-space is left behind.

Special Status, Out-of-Body Experience.
Although human consciousness c a n ,
with enough practice,movebeyondt h edimension of time-space and interface with other energy systems in other dimensions, the entire process is appreciably enhanced if that consciousness can be detached i n large measure from the physical body before such interface is attempted. Once an individual becomes proficient in the technique of out-of-body movement and then reaches the point where he i s able to break out of time-space while out of his body, he gains the advantage of "clicking out" part of his enhanced consciousness while starting from a base located much closer to the dimensions with which he wishes to communicate.
In
other words, since he is starting from a point much "higher up", to use an analogy from the time-space context, that part of his consciousness involved in "clicking out" will have that much more time to interact in dimensions beyond time-space because less time is required to traverse the intervening layers. Moreover, once the individual is able to project his consciousness beyond time-space, that consciousness would logically tend to entrain its frequency output with the new energy environment to which it is exposed, therein greatly enhancing the extent to which the individual's altered consciousness may be further modified to achieve a much heightened point of focus and a much refined oscillating pattern. As a result, a self-reinforcing process should ensue whereby the farther consciousness in the out-of-body state can be projected beyond the time-space dimension, the more its level of energy output would be enhanced, thus promoting the potential for still further travel. The tentative conclusion to be drawn is that the out-of-body state may be regarded as an extremely effective way of accelerating the process of enhancing consciousness and of interfacing with dimensions beyond time-space..
If the practitioner of the Gateway technique has a choice of concentrating on achieving and exploiting the out-of-body experience as opposed to concentrating his full efforts on expanding his consciousness exclusively from a physical base, the former would appear to promise much faster and more impressive successes than does
the latter.

to deduce information which is ultimately processed through the left hemisphere of
our brains to reduce it to a form that we employ for the process we call thinking.
We have implied that this hologram is the finite embodiment in active, energy form
of the infinite consciousness of the Absolute. It is the title we assigned to that
vast pool of energy in a state of perfect rest over which the physical universe is
layered, and from whence it comes. Incidentally, to describe this, Bentov uses the
analogy of a very deep sea, comparing the still depths of the sea to the dimension
of the Absolute while assigning the storm-tossed waves above to represent the
physical universe with which we are familiar. The slightly agitated currents of
the sea to be found in between the turbulent surface and the totally still depths
represent energy in the process of either going into rest(i.e. approaching
infinity) or coming out of rest.

From Big Bang to Torus. Working from the widely accepted "Big Bang" theory
Bentov presents a conceptual model to depict the process of time-space evolution
the relative position of the universal hologram. That hologram is often called a
"Torus" because it is thought to have the overall shape of an immense,
self-contained spiral. Basing his thesis on recent studies concerning the
distribution of quasars(quasi-stellar objects), and operating on the premise that
in the universe smaller processes tend to be mirror images of larger ones(i.e. the
pattern of electrons around the nucleus of an atom mirrors the way planets orbit
their suns,
and so on) Bentov postulates the following scenario. Taking his cue
from the observed capability of quasars to eject enormously concentrated beams of
matter from their interiors in a controlled, non-concentric version of the
"Big-bang" he envisages a similar process occurring in the generation of the
universe (see Exhibit 4, next page). Noting that those galaxies located to the
north of our own galaxy are moving away faster than those located to the south, and
that those to the east and west are demonstrably more distant, Bentov regards this
as substantive evidence that the jet of matter which expanded into our universe has

of its trip to the far end of the ovoid, he sees it departing via a "black hole".
In such a model, time is observed to be a measure of the change which occurs as
energy evolves into new, more complex forms as it progresses along the distance
from the white hole side of the nucleus, around the shell of this "cosmic egg"
until it enters the black hole. In other words, as energy--expelled from infinity
and confined within limits by the conscious of the Absolute--achieves form and
motion following ejection from the white hole at the top of the egg, time begins as
a measure of the cadence of this evolutionary movement as "reality" goes around the
shell of the egg on its journey to the black hole at the far end.

Our Place in Time. The observed distribution of galaxies suggests that our
particular universe is located near the top of the egg at the point where matter
begins to fall back on itself, thus explaining the reason why the galaxies to the
north are seen to be moving away more rapidly as they are caught up in the downturn
of the stream of matter towards the far end of the cosmic egg (see Exhibit 5, next
page). Layered over this cosmic egg is the Absolute which sustains the radiating

Role of REM Sleep. It is interesting to note that Bob Monroe informed the
Gateway class that finished 7 May 1983 that an ex-trainer of his operating in
Charlottesville, Virginia found that he could guarantee out-of-body movements by
bringing participants down into a rapid eye movement (REM) state of sleep and then
use the Hemi-Sync tape technique. This may well be a function of the fact that
most if not all people reputedly go into an out-of-body state during REM sleep.
REM sleep is the deepest possible level of ordinary sleep and involves complete
disengagement of the body's motor cortex functions from the neck down and nearly

this is to put the body in a state of complete stillness so far as the skeletal
muscle structure is concerned, thereby further promoting the state of deep rest
needed to eliminate the bifurcation echo. In addition, it leaves the right
hemisphere of the brain free to respond to the instructions and suggestions
contained on the Gateway tape. However, use of the Hemi-Sync tapes at this point
may be less a factor in actually achieving the out-of-body state than it is a
matter of focusing the brain enough so that a residual memory of having naturally

fact functions of the same kind of altered consciousness involved in interaction
with the universe that plays a role in all of the Focus 12, 15 and 21 states
described above. The difference between those states and the condition of the mind
in REM sleep seems to be that the left hemisphere is almost totally disengaged in
the latter experience such that memory of what was achieved in the altered states
of consciousness cannot usually be retrieved by conscious desire because the left
hemisphere has no knowledge of its existence or its location in the right
hemisphere. Admittedly, some people can be trained to remember their REM state
dreams through intense conditioning in the waking state but even that may be more a
function of establishing pathways in the right hemisphere which the left hemisphere
can access following reentry into the wakeful state than it is an indication of any
specific left hemisphere conscious involvement in the process during REM sleep.

Belief System Considerations:
In 1967, Alexandra David-Neel and Ilama Yongden wrotea bookentitledSecretOral Teachings in Tibetan Buddhist Sects, from which the following quote is taken:
"The tangible world is movement, say the Masters, not a collection of moving objects, but movement itself. There are no objects "in movement," i t is the movement which constitutes the objects which appear to us: They are nothing but movement.
This movement is a continued and infinitely rapid succession of flashes of energy(in Tibetan "tsal" or "shoug"). All objects perceptible to our senses, all phenomena of whatever kind and whatever aspect they may assume, are constituted by a rapid succession of instantaneous events.
The classic description of the universal hologram is to be found in a Hindu sutra which says:
"In the heaven of Indra there is said to be a network of pearls so arranged that if you look at one you see all the others reflected in it.
I have cited this quotation because i t shows that the concept of the universe which at least some physicists are now coming to accept is identical in its essential aspects with the one known to the learned elite in selected civilizations and cultures of high attainment in the ancient world. The concept of the cosmic egg, for example, is well known to scholars familiar with the ancient writings of the eastern religions. Nor are the theories presented in this paper at variance with the essential tenets of the Judeo-Christian stream of thought. The concept of visible r e a l i t y i . e . the "created" world) as being an emanation of an omnipotent and omniscient divinity who is completely unknowable in his primary state of
being. The Absolute at rest in infinity is a concept straight out of Hebrew mystical philosophy. Even the Christian concept of the Trinity shines through the description of the Absolute as presented in this paper. The description of energy totally at rest, in infinity fits the Christian metaphysical concept of the Father while the infinite self-consciousness resident in that energy providing the motive force of will to bring a portion of that energy into motion to create reality corresponds with the Son. This is so because in order to attain self-consciousness, the consciousness of the Absolute must project a hologram of itself and then perceive it. That hologram i s a mirror image of the Absolute in infinity, still exists outside time and space, but is one step removed from the Absolute and is the actual agent of all creation(all reality).
And, the eternal thought or concept of self which results from this self-consciousness serves the
