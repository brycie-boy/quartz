## Private property

Private property is a legal designation for the ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities. Private property is foundational to [capitalism](Capitalism.md). I believe it to be founded on [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md) and [clinging](Clinging.md).
