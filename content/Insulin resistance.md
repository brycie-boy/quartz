## Insulin resistance

[Insulin](Insulin.md) resistance occurs when the [cell]()s in the muscles, fat, and l[iver]() no longer respond to the [insulin](Insulin.md) signal. [Glucose]() thus can’t get in, and so the [cell]()s send signals to the [pancreas]() to crank out even more [insulin](Insulin.md). The [glucose]() builds up in the blood at the same time that the [cell]()s are starving, adding insult to injury. Insulin resistance is the primary defect in [metabolic syndrome](Metabolic%20syndrome.md).
