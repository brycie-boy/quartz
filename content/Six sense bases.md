## Six sense bases  #⏳ 

- the first five sense organs correspond to the [[Peripheral nervous system]]
- The mind base corresponds to the [[Central nervous system]]

The six pairs of sense bases are the six internal sense faculties and their corresponding external objects, which support the arising of the respective type of [[consciousness]]. Because the internal sense bases mediate between [[consciousness]] and its objects, they are refered to as “the six bases of [[sense impression]].” The six sense bases and their respective types of [[consciousness]] consist of:

- eye, forms, and visual-[[consciousness]] (seeing)
- ear, sounds, and auditory-[[consciousness]] (hearing)
- nose, smells, and olfactory-[[consciousness]] (smelling)
- tongue, tastes, and gustatory-[[consciousness]] (tasting)
- body, tactile objects, and tactile-[[consciousness]] (touching)
- [[mind]], phenomena, and mental-[[consciousness]] (cognizing)

[[The Nikayas]] suggest an interesting difference between the treatment of [[the five aggregates]] and the six sense bases. While they both serve as the basis from which [[clinging]] occurs, [[the five aggregates]] are the basis for [[identity view]], and the six sense bases are the basis for [[craving]]. Thus a necessary step in the conquest of [[craving]] is the restraint of the senses. Practitioners must be vigilant in their encounters with pleasant and painful sense objects. When one is negligent, experience through the senses invariably becomes a trigger for [[craving]].

Note: I am skeptical of the passage above. As long as youre mindful and pay attention the three characteristics and the three standpoints, you would develop a natrual dispassion and restraint wouldnt be necessary right? Then again, restraint can help develop impulse control

Note: no because restraint is not the same as repression
