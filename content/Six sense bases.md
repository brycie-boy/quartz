## Six sense bases  #‚è≥

* the first five sense organs correspond to the [Peripheral nervous system](Peripheral%20nervous%20system.md)
* The mind base corresponds to the [Central nervous system]()

The six pairs of sense bases are the six internal sense faculties and their corresponding external objects, which support the arising of the respective type of [consciousness](Consciousness.md). Because the internal sense bases mediate between [consciousness](Consciousness.md) and its objects, they are refered to as ‚Äúthe six bases of [sense impression](Sense%20impression.md).‚Äù The six sense bases and their respective types of [consciousness](Consciousness.md) consist of:

* eye, forms, and visual-[consciousness](Consciousness.md) (seeing)
* ear, sounds, and auditory-[consciousness](Consciousness.md) (hearing)
* nose, smells, and olfactory-[consciousness](Consciousness.md) (smelling)
* tongue, tastes, and gustatory-[consciousness](Consciousness.md) (tasting)
* body, tactile objects, and tactile-[consciousness](Consciousness.md) (touching)
* [mind](Mind.md), phenomena, and mental-[consciousness](Consciousness.md) (cognizing)

[The Nikayas]() suggest an interesting difference between the treatment of [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md) and the six sense bases. While they both serve as the basis from which [clinging](Clinging.md) occurs, [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md) are the basis for [identity view](Identity%20view.md), and the six sense bases are the basis for [craving](Craving.md). Thus a necessary step in the conquest of [craving](Craving.md) is the restraint of the senses. Practitioners must be vigilant in their encounters with pleasant and painful sense objects. When one is negligent, experience through the senses invariably becomes a trigger for [craving](Craving.md).

Note: I am skeptical of the passage above. As long as youre mindful and pay attention the three characteristics and the three standpoints, you would develop a natrual dispassion and restraint wouldnt be necessary right? Then again, restraint can help develop impulse control

Note: no because restraint is not the same as repression
