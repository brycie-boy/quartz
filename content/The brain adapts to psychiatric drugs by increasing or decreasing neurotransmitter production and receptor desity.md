## The brain adapts to psychiatric drugs by increasing or decreasing neurotransmitter production and receptor desity

Antipsychotics, antidepressants, and other psychotropic drugs create perturbations in [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) functions. In response, the [brain](Brain.md) goes through a series of compensatory adaptations. [Drug]()s that block a [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) ([antagonists]()), such as [antipsychotic]()s, make the [autoreceptor](Autoreceptor.md)s tell the presynaptic [neuron](Neuron.md)s spring into hyper gear and release more of it, and the postsynaptic [neuron](Neuron.md)s increase the density of their [receptor](Receptor.md)s for that chemical messenger. [Drug]()s that increase the synaptic levels of a [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) ([agonist]()) (as an antidepressant does), the presynaptic [neuron](Neuron.md)s decrease their firing rates and the postsynaptic [neuron](Neuron.md)s decrease the desnity of their [receptor](Receptor.md)s for the [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md). In each instance, the [brain](Brain.md) is trying to nullify the [drug]()‚Äôs effects. These adaptations are rooted in homeostatic mechanisms that exist, presumably, to permit cells to maintain their equilibrium in the face of alterations in the environment or changes in the internal milieu.

However, after a period of time, these compensatory mechanisms break down. The chronic administration of the drug then causes substantial and long-lasting alterations in [neural](Neuron.md) function. As part of this long-term adaptation process, there are changes in intracellular signaling pathways and [gene]() expression. After a few weeks the person‚Äôs [brain](Brain.md) is functioning in a manner that is different from the normal state. Again, [modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it](Modern%20medicine%20tends%20to%20target%20the%20pathology%20of%20an%20illness%20rather%20than%20preventing%20it.md). It may also have to do with [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) deficit because [the right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20the%20ability%20to%20put%20ourselves%20in%20anothers%20shoes.md).
