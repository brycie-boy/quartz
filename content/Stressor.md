## Stressor

A stressor is anything in the outside world that knocks you out of [homeostatic](Homeostasis.md) balance. But when we consider that [stress experienced by humans is generally psychological or social](Stress%20experienced%20by%20humans%20is%20generally%20psychological%20or%20social.md), we have to expand on the notion of stressors merely being things that knock you out of [homeostatic](Homeostasis.md) balance. A stressor can also be the anticipation of that happening.
