## Probiotic consumption has been shown to reverse depression symptoms

An animal study in 2017 from the University of Virginia School of Medicine indicated that [Lactobacillus](), a single gut bacterium commonly found in live cultures in yogurt, can reverse [depression](Depression.md) in rats. More recently, similar findings have been established in humans as well. 

In 2010, [Michael Messaoudi]() and his colleagues studied fifty-five healthy men and women who were randomly assigned to receive either a daily [probiotic](Probiotic.md) formula or a placebo for thirty days. Before and after treatment, the research subjects filled out questionnaires about their mood. They also provided urine samples so that their levels of [cortisol](Cortisol.md) could be checked. Compared to the placebo group, those in the [probiotic](Probiotic.md) group reported less [depression](Depression.md), and urinary levels of [cortisol](Cortisol.md) were lower, indicating that their [brain](Brain.md)s were less [depressed](Depression.md) and less stressed. Why was this the case? Certain species of [gut bacteria]() have the ability to boost levels of [brain](Brain.md) chemicals such as [gamma-aminobutyric acid](), which may speed relief from [depression](Depression.md) and other mental health conditions
