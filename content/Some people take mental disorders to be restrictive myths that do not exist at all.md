## Some people take mental disorders to be restrictive myths that do not exist at all

[Some people believe psychiatry can find the true essence of mental disorders](Some%20people%20believe%20psychiatry%20can%20find%20the%20true%20essence%20of%20mental%20disorders.md). Another perspective on psychiatry presents just the opposite view‚Äîthe skeptical and solipsistic doubt that man can ever catch protean reality by the tail and know things as they truly are. They would argue that [mental disorder]()s are no more than arbitrary and sometimes noxious ‚Äúmyths‚Äù that unfairly restrict the freedom of choice of psychiatric patients. They worry about the slippery slope that eventually could be extended to other vulnerable groups. Indeed, there is reason for this concern‚Äîpsychiatric diagnosis is now being abused for preventive detention of rapists in the United States and peasants complaining about corruption in China and previously was an excuse to hospitalize political dissidents in the Soviet Union.

It is of course imperative that we protect against the misuse of psychiatry in the service of legal or political masters‚Äîbut this perspective far overstates it's case. Mental disorders are not complete myths. Though not a discrete ‚Äúdisease entity‚Äù (like, say, a brain tumor or a stroke), [schizophrenia](), for example, produces profound and prolonged ‚Äúdis-ease‚Äù‚Äîthat is, distress and incapacity actually experienced by many. The patterns of its presentation are clearly recognizable, can be reliably diagnosed, have [brain](Brain.md) imaging correlates, predict course, and respond to specific treatments. It is the same for many other [mental disorder]()s. [Schizophrenia]() is *real enough* and no psychiatric invention for those who suffer from it and for their loved ones.
