## A gluten-free diet can increase amino acids known to be precursors for mood regulating neurotransmitters for those with gluten issues

In 2005, [P√§ivi A. Pynn√∂nen]() and her colleagues assessed adolescents with [celiac disease]() and behavioral problems. They found that adolescent celiac disease patients had significantly lower tryptophan concentrations in their blood. Three months after patients started a gluten-free diet, the researchers found a significant decrease in patients‚Äô psychiatric symptoms compared to their baseline condition, coinciding with significantly decreased celiac disease activity and prolactin levels and with a significant increase in [L-tyrosine](), [L-tryptophan](), and other [amino acid]()s known to be precursors of [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s such as [serotonin](Serotonin.md) and [dopamine](Dopamine.md). The authors concluded that it was possible that behavioral problems, may in part be due to certain important precursor [amino acid]()s not being available until people stopped eating gluten.
