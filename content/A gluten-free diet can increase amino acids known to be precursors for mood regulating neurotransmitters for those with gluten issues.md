## A gluten-free diet can increase amino acids known to be precursors for mood regulating neurotransmitters for those with gluten issues # 

In 2005, [[P√§ivi A. Pynn√∂nen]] and her colleagues assessed adolescents with [[celiac disease]] and behavioral problems. They found that adolescent celiac disease patients had significantly lower tryptophan concentrations in their blood. Three months after patients started a gluten-free diet, the researchers found a significant decrease in patients‚Äô psychiatric symptoms compared to their baseline condition, coinciding with significantly decreased celiac disease activity and prolactin levels and with a significant increase in [[L-tyrosine]], [[L-tryptophan]], and other [[amino acid]]s known to be precursors of [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[serotonin]] and [[dopamine]]. The authors concluded that it was possible that behavioral problems, may in part be due to certain important precursor [[amino acid]]s not being available until people stopped eating gluten.
