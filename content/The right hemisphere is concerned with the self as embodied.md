## The right hemisphere is concerned with the self as embodied

Emotion is inseparable from the body in which it is felt, and emotion is also the basis for our engagement with the world. Social understanding in the sense of empathic connection, as well as understanding how others feel, what they mean not only by what they say in context, as we have seen, but by their facial expressions, their ‚Äòbody language‚Äô and tone of voice‚Äîall this is made possible by the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md).

In keeping with its capacity for emotion, and its predisposition to understand mental experience within the context of the body, rather than abstracting it, the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is deeply connected to the self as embodied. Although each side of the [brain](Brain.md) has both motor and sensory connections with the opposite side of the body, we know that the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) carries an image only of the right side of the body‚Äîwhen the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is incapacitated, the left part of the individual's body virtually ceases to exist for that person. It is only the right [parietal lobe]() that has a whole body image. Importantly this body image is not just a picture. It is not a representation (as it would be if it were in the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)), or just the sum of our bodily perceptions, or something imagined, but a living image, intimately linked to activity in the world‚Äîan essentially affective experience. Which is why disturbances in it lead to profoundly disturbing illnesses, such as body dysmorphia and anorexia nervosa.
