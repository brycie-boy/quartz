## A right hemisphere stroke is more disabling than a left in that one loses the ability to socialize and empathize

Things that are value-laden for me, because of their place in ‚Äòmy‚Äô world, are salient to the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), a consequence of its concern for what has personal meaning ([The right hemisphere deals with real things that have meaning to us in the lived world](The%20right%20hemisphere%20deals%20with%20real%20things%20that%20have%20meaning%20to%20us%20in%20the%20lived%20world.md)). The ‚ÄòI‚Äô, here, is a social being, however, not an objectified isolated entity, since the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) mediates social behavior in all its ramifications. This is why a [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) stroke, although not involving speech directly, is in practice more disabling than a [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) stroke, despite the fact that in a [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) stroke speech is usually lost. 

Following a [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) stroke, despite the difficulties incurred with loss of speech and loss of use of the right hand, the chances of independent living are higher than after a [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) stroke. It is not just the capacity to interpret emotional signals, in a functional or utilitarian sense, that is mediated by the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) ([The right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20our%20capacity%20for%20emotional%20understanding.md)). While the capacity to interpret other's minds, even to appreciate what they must be thinking and feeling‚Äîthe capacity that is missing in [autism]()‚Äîis lost in a [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) stroke, it is more than that too: it is the capacity positively to empathize. Meaning is more than words.
