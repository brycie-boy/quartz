## ADHD and addiction can be traced to similar causes

The link between [ADHD](ADHD.md) and a predisposition to [addiction](Addiction.md) is obvious and, in fact, inevitable. The connection has little to do with [gene]()tics. [ADHD](ADHD.md) is no more inherited genetically than [addiction](Addiction.md) is, despite the widespread assumption among ADHD experts that it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe most heritable of all mental disorders.‚Äù Like [addition](), scientific findings since then have only confirmed that pre- and postnatal stresses are the most important determinants of [ADHD](ADHD.md) (see [Childhood development plays a strong role in the development of mental illness and addiction](Childhood%20development%20plays%20a%20strong%20role%20in%20the%20development%20of%20mental%20illness%20and%20addiction.md)). According to a 2004 study by B. R. Van den Bergh and A. Marcoen, for example, percent of [ADHD](ADHD.md) symptoms in eight- and nine-year-old children can be directly linked to maternal anxiety during pregnancy. Abused children are far more likely than others to be diagnosed with [ADHD](ADHD.md), and the same [brain](Brain.md) structures affected by childhood trauma are most consistently abnormal in scans of children with [ADHD](ADHD.md). [The quality of the realtionships with childhood caregivers determines the capacity for a healthy stress-response](The%20quality%20of%20the%20realtionships%20with%20childhood%20caregivers%20determines%20the%20capacity%20for%20a%20healthy%20stress-response.md).
