## Decreased activity in the default mode network correlated with a decreased sense of self

Most of us consider [Identity view](Identity%20view.md) as an unshakable given, as real as anything we know, and as the foundation of our life as conscious human beings. One of Dr. [Robert Carhart-Harris]()’s first experiments with [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s was that the steepest drops in [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) activity correlated with his volunteers’ subjective experience of “[ego](Ego.md) dissolution.” (“I existed only as an idea or concept,” one volunteer reported. Recalled another, “I didn’t know where I ended and my surroundings began.”) The more precipitous the drop-off in blood flow and oxygen consumption in the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), the more likely a volunteer was to report the loss of a sense of self. The transcendence of self reported by expert meditators showed up on fMRIs as a quieting of the default mode network. It appears that when activity in the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) falls off precipitously, the [ego](Ego.md) temporarily vanishes. The [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md) experience of “[non-duality]()” suggests that consciousness survives the disappearance of the self, that it is not so indispensable as we—and it—like to think.
