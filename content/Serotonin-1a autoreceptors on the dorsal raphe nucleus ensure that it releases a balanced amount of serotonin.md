## Serotonin-1a autoreceptors on the dorsal raphe nucleus ensure that it releases a balanced amount of serotonin  #üß† 

[[Serotonin]] [[neuron]]s in the [[dorsal raphe nucleus]] possess an extra control system: they express a set of [[serotonin]]-1a [[autoreceptor]]s on the presynaptic side. By preventing these [[neuron]]s from firing too rapidly, these [[autoreceptor]]s make sure the [[serotonin]] [[neuron]]s don‚Äôt wear out; and there is rarely enough [[serotonin]] in the [[synapse]] to down-regulate those-1a [[autoreceptor]]s.
