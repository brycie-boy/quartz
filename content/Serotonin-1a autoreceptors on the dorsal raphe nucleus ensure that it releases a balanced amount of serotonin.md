## Serotonin-1a autoreceptors on the dorsal raphe nucleus ensure that it releases a balanced amount of serotonin

[Serotonin](Serotonin.md) [neuron](Neuron.md)s in the [dorsal raphe nucleus]() possess an extra control system: they express a set of [serotonin](Serotonin.md)-1a [autoreceptor](Autoreceptor.md)s on the presynaptic side. These [receptor](Receptor.md)s normally serve as a feedback loop that regulates how frequently that [neuron](Neuron.md) fires. It’s like the servo-mechanism of the thermostat in your house. When the temperature drops, the thermostat kicks the heat on, and when it gets too hot, the furnace turns off. The-1a [autoreceptor](Autoreceptor.md) serves as the [neuron](Neuron.md)’s thermostat, causing it to fire relatively slowly and rhythmically, and silencing it before it gets into trouble. By preventing these [neuron](Neuron.md)s from firing too rapidly, these [autoreceptor](Autoreceptor.md)s make sure the [serotonin](Serotonin.md) [neuron](Neuron.md)s don’t wear out; and there is rarely enough [serotonin](Serotonin.md) in the [synapse](Synapse.md) to down-regulate those-1a autoreceptors. SSRIs turn those [autoreceptor](Autoreceptor.md)s off; it’s like setting the temperature threshold on your servo-mechanism thermostat much higher, and those [serotonin](Serotonin.md) nerve terminals fire like gangbusters; thus the antidepressant effects.
