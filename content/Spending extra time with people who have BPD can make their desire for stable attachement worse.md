## Spending extra time with people who have BPD can make their desire for stable attachement worse

If you spend extra time with some one who has [Borderline Personality Disorder](Borderline%20Personality%20Disorder.md) because they ‚Äúreally needed it,‚Äù It makes them feel special. They want someone to provide stable [attachment](Attachment.md) and a predictible roadmap of the world. Subconsciously, they will try to trigger any behavior that would indicate this. If any behaviors are inconsistent, they will get the stickiest type of [reinforcement](Operant%20conditioning.md). 

We should stop feeling conflicted and guilty about not giving people with BPD ‚Äúextra‚Äù time, because it is more harmful than helpful. Doing so would just be [enabling](Enabling.md). We can help them learn to develop a more stable sense of themselves and their world, starting with the very simple guideline of always beginning and ending visits on time. More intermittent [reinforcement](Operant%20conditioning.md)‚Äîand with it will become stable learning and [habit](Habit.md)uation.
