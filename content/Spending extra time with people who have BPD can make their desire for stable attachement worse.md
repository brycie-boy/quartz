## Spending extra time with people who have BPD can make their desire for stable attachement worse  # 

If you spend extra time with some one who has [[Borderline Personality Disorder]] because they “really needed it,” It makes them feel special. They want someone to provide stable [[attachment]] and a predictible roadmap of the world. Subconsciously, they will try to trigger any behavior that would indicate this. If any behaviors are inconsistent, they will get the stickiest type of [[Operant conditioning|reinforcement]]. 

We should stop feeling conflicted and guilty about not giving people with BPD “extra” time, because it is more harmful than helpful. Doing so would just be [[enabling]]. We can help them learn to develop a more stable sense of themselves and their world, starting with the very simple guideline of always beginning and ending visits on time. More intermittent [[Operant conditioning|reinforcement]]—and with it will become stable learning and [[habit]]uation.
