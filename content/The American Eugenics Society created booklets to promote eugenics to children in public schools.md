## The American Eugenics Society created booklets to promote eugenics to children in public schools

[After the 1921 Second International Congress on Eugenics, many prominent eugenicists joined to form a U.S. national eugenics society to promote eugenics to the public](After%20the%201921%20Second%20International%20Congress%20on%20Eugenics,%20many%20prominent%20eugenicists%20joined%20to%20form%20a%20U.S.%20national%20eugenics%20society%20to%20promote%20eugenics%20to%20the%20public.md). In a 137-page booklet called “Tomorrow’s Children,” designed to serve as the society’s “catechism,” schoolchildren and other readers were encouraged to think of the American [Eugenics](Eugenics.md) Society as a “Society for the Control of Social [Cancer]().” The mentally ill and other defectives were an “insidious disease,” and each time they had children, they created “new cancers in the body politic.” In a modern society, [cancer]() needed to be treated with a “surgeon’s knife.” At the moment, though, American society was failing to respond to this threat: “Crime and dependency keep on increasing because new defectives are born, just as new [cancer]() [cell]()s remorselessly penetrate into sound tissue.” Consider this with the fact that [the US public schooling system has its roots in Prussia](The%20US%20public%20schooling%20system%20has%20its%20roots%20in%20Prussia.md), the predecessor to Nazi Germany, which was established between 1905 and 1915, directly preceding these events. Furthermore, [eugenics had spread from America to Nazi Germany when their economy fell after world war I and they couldn't afford to place mentally ill soldiers in asylums](Eugenics%20had%20spread%20from%20America%20to%20Nazi%20Germany%20when%20their%20economy%20fell%20after%20world%20war%20I%20and%20they%20couldn't%20afford%20to%20place%20mentally%20ill%20soldiers%20in%20asylums.md). Tells you a lot about the trajectory the U.S. was on. Maybe the U.S. wasn't so different from Nazi Germany after all.
