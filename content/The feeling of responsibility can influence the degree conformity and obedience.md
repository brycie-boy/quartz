## The feeling of responsibility can influence the degree conformity and obedience

Another issue concerning [conformity](Conformity.md) and [obedience](obedience.md) is responsibility. When debriefed afterward, compliant teachers typically cited how persuasive they found the information that the learner had been informed of the risks and had given consent. “Don’t worry, you won’t be held responsible.” The Milgram phenomenon also showed the coercive power of misdirecting responsibility, when researchers would seek compliance by emphasizing that the teacher’s responsibility was to the project, not the learner—“I thought you said you were here to help.” “You’re a team member.” “You’re ruining things.” “You signed a form.” It’s hard enough to respond with “This isn’t the job I signed up for.” It’s that much harder when the fine print reveals that this is what you signed up for.

Compliance increases when guilt is diffused—even if I hadn’t done it, it still would have happened. This is why, historically, people were not executed with five shots fired from one gun. Instead there were five guns fired simultaneously—a firing squad. Firing squads traditionally took the diffusion of responsibility a step further, where one member was randomly given a blank instead of a real bullet. That way, a shooter could shift from the comforting irrationality that “I only one fifth killed him” to the even better “I may not even have shot him.” This tradition was translated into modern execution technology. Lethal injection machines used in prison executions come with a dual control system—two syringes, each filled with a lethal dose, two separate delivery systems, two buttons pressed simultaneously by two different people—at which point a random binary generator would secretly determine which syringe was emptied into a bucket and which into a human. And then the record would be erased, allowing each person to think, “Hey, I may not even have given him any drug.”
