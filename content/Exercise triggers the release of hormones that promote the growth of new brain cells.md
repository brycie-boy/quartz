## Exercise triggers the release of hormones that promote the growth of new brain cells

If we‚Äôre going to have [neuron](Neuron.md)s, we‚Äôll need fertilizer for them, and from the get-go, [neurogenesis](Neurogenesis.md) researchers have been onto [BDNF](BDNF.md). They already knew that without [BDNF](BDNF.md) our [brain](Brain.md)s can‚Äôt take in new information (see [BDNF is necessary for LTP to be able to occur](BDNF%20is%20necessary%20for%20LTP%20to%20be%20able%20to%20occur.md)), and now they‚Äôve seen that [BDNF](BDNF.md) is also a necessary ingredient for making new [neuron](Neuron.md)s.

[BDNF](BDNF.md) gathers in reserve pools near the [synapse](Synapse.md)s and is unleashed when we get our blood pumping. In the process, a number of [hormone]()s from the body are called into action to help; [IGF-1](IGF-1.md) ([insulin](Insulin.md)-like growth factor), [VEGF](VEGF.md) (vascular endothelial growth factor), and [FGF-2](FGF-2.md) (fibroblast growth factor). During exercise, these factors push through the [blood-brain barrier](). Scientists have just recently learned that once inside the [brain](Brain.md), these factors work with [BDNF](BDNF.md) to crank up the molecular machinery of learning. They are also produced within the [brain](Brain.md) and promote [stem-cell]() division, especially during exercise. The broader importance is that these factors trace a direct link from the body to the [brain](Brain.md).
