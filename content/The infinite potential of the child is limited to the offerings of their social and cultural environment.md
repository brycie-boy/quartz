## The infinite potential of the child is limited to the offerings of their social and cultural environment  # 

The infant is genetically prepared to learn any language, master any skill, play any sex role; in a very short time, however, they become mechanically, robotically, fixated to accept, follow and mimic the limited offerings of their social and cultural environment. In this process, each of us pays a heavy price. Survival and status mean forfeiting the infinite possibilities of unconditioned consciousness. The domesticated primate, inside the social [[reality tunnel]], is a trivial fragment of the potentials for experience and intelligence innate in the 110,000,000,000-cell human biocomputer ([[Brain]]). As long as we remain on the antique circuits we are not very different from insects. That is, just as insects repeat their four-stage program (egg, larvae, chrysalis, adult) from generation to generation, we repeat our four-stage cycle also. The antique circuits of [[the eight circuits of consciousness]] are genetically conservative. They ensure the survival and continuation of the species, but do no more. For future evolution we must look to the futuristic circuits.
