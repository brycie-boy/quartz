## The infinite potential of the child is limited to the offerings of their social and cultural environment

The infant is genetically prepared to learn any language, master any skill, play any sex role; in a very short time, however, they become mechanically, robotically, fixated to accept, follow and mimic the limited offerings of their social and cultural environment. In this process, each of us pays a heavy price. Survival and status mean forfeiting the infinite possibilities of unconditioned consciousness. The domesticated primate, inside the social [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md), is a trivial fragment of the potentials for experience and intelligence innate in the 110,000,000,000-cell human biocomputer ([Brain](Brain.md)). As long as we remain on the antique circuits we are not very different from insects. That is, just as insects repeat their four-stage program (egg, larvae, chrysalis, adult) from generation to generation, we repeat our four-stage cycle also. The antique circuits of [the eight circuits of consciousness](The%20eight%20circuits%20of%20consciousness.md) are genetically conservative. They ensure the survival and continuation of the species, but do no more. For future evolution we must look to the futuristic circuits.
