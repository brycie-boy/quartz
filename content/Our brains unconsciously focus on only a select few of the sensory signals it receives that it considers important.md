## Our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important

We receive around 10,000 sensory signals per minute and the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) edits out probably around 9990 of them, and [the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md), so the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) shines it's [spotlight](Spotlight%20consciousness.md) on less than 10 signals that seem important to us. The [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) only admits only that measly trickle of information required for us to get through the day. The other 9990 signals are unconsciously classified as "meaningless" or "irrelevent." They're not consciously suppressed because they never reach the conscious centers of the [brain](Brain.md). If the majority of these signals did reach the conscious centers, we would be so overwhelmed that we would not be able to act at all. The reason why is the [brain](Brain.md) is ordinarily so constrained rather than so open may simply be as simple as efficiency. To form a perception of something out in the world, the [brain](Brain.md) takes in as little sensory information as it needs to make an educated guess. We are forever cutting to the chase, basically, and leaping to conclusions, relying on prior experience to inform current perception.
