I’m trying to find a potential solving lead in this story. Haven’t really spotted anything yet

Odins search for wisdom may be represented by choosing to encrypt the LP in runes.

I think this story also sounds like a metaphorical expression of Wilson’s meta-programming. Yggdrasil may be seen as a metaphor for the mind. The Norns shaped the reality held by Yggdrasil's branches by carving runes into Yggdrasil’s trunk. Runes are just letters, which in turn make up words, then models, etc. so in seeing Yggdrasil as the mind I think this could be interpreted as the database of beliefs and models that shape our conscious experience. Wilson describes the brain as a “self-programming computer. It chooses—usually unconsciously and mechanically—the quality of consciousness it will experience and the reality-tunnel it will employ to orchestrate the incoming signals from the experienced world.” The Norns may be seen to represent this unconscious programming that shapes our experience. 

Meta-programming is when “the brain becomes conscious of this unconscious programming.” Odin could be seen as unlocking his capacity for meta-programming when he hung himself from Yggdrasil and stared into the Well of Urd (from which Yggdrasil grows out of) until these runes had “shown themselves to him” and revealed the “secrets that lie within them.” Odin envied the Norns powers and their wisdom and Wayne sit for himself. This sounds also a bit like what we’re doing solving LP huh? Trying to reveal the secrets behind a set of runes. Perhaps that’s why they chose to encrypt in runes. This process may be symbolized in the way in which LP was encrypted.

To bad a can’t do any cryptography rn
