## The selective function

The selective function is one of [Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school](Alexander%20Inglis%20six%20basic%20functions%20of%20school.md). It refers not to human choice but a [eugenics](Eugenics.md) process as applied to what he called ‚Äúthe favored races.‚Äù In short, the idea is to help things along by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the unfit‚Äîwith poor grades, remedial placement, and other punishments‚Äîclearly enough that their peers will accept them as inferior and effectively bar them from the reproductive sweepstakes. That‚Äôs what all those little humiliations from first grade onward were intended to do: wash the dirt down the drain. 

Perhaps this has to do with how [Parents seek autism diagnoses for their children to acquire eligibility for school and therapeutic programs](Parents%20seek%20autism%20diagnoses%20for%20their%20children%20to%20acquire%20eligibility%20for%20school%20and%20therapeutic%20programs.md). I see this as an example of how one, [Psychiatry plays a moralizing role for society by defining behavior in terms of normal and abnormal](Psychiatry%20plays%20a%20moralizing%20role%20for%20society%20by%20defining%20behavior%20in%20terms%20of%20normal%20and%20abnormal.md), and two, [Psychiatric diagnosis‚Äô can distort and control dissenting information by regarding rebellious behavior as a product of mental illness](Psychiatric%20diagnosis%E2%80%99%20can%20distort%20and%20control%20dissenting%20information%20by%20regarding%20rebellious%20behavior%20as%20a%20product%20of%20mental%20illness.md).
