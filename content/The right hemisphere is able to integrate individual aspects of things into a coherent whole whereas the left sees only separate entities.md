## The right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities # 

The contrast between the differing world views of the two [[brain hemisphere]]s is brought into focus in a remarkable way by the issue of sameness and difference. For example, an individual could be seen as an infinite number of serial moments, experiences and perceptions (as the [[left hemisphere]] would see it), which are of course (at least as far as the [[right hemisphere]] is concerned) a single whole. This is because [[the right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts]].

Your wife or husband who left the house this morning may be in a different mood or have a different haircut by the evening, but this doesn't present a problem of identification, because these separate slices of experience, these separate frames of the film, as the [[left hemisphere]] would see it, are not really separate at all‚Äîthey are the different aspects of one unique whole.

But with certain [[right hemisphere]] deficits, the capacity for seeing the whole is lost, and subjects start to believe they are dealing with different people. They may develop the belief that a person they know very well is actually being ‚Äòre-presented‚Äô by an impostor, a condition known, after its first describer, as [[Capgras syndrome]]. Small perceptual changes seem to suggest a wholly different entity, not just a new bit of information that needs to be integrated into the whole: the significance of the part, in this sense, outweighs the pull of the whole.
