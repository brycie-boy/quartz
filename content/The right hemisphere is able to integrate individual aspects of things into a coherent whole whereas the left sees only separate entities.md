## The right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities

The contrast between the differing world views of the two [brain hemisphere]()s is brought into focus in a remarkable way by the issue of sameness and difference. An individual could be seen as a little universe, an infinite number of serial moments, experiences and perceptions (as the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) would see it), which are of course (at least as far as the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is concerned) a single whole. This is because [the right hemisphere sees the whole before the left hemisphere separates it into parts](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20the%20whole%20before%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20separates%20it%20into%20parts.md).

Your wife or husband who left the house this morning may be in a different mood or have a different haircut by the evening, but this doesn't present a problem of identification, because these separate slices of experience, these separate frames of the film, as the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) would see it, are not really separate at all‚Äîthey are the different aspects of one unique whole.

But with certain [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) deficits, the capacity for seeing the whole is lost, and subjects start to believe they are dealing with different people. They may develop the belief that a person they know very well is actually being ‚Äòre-presented‚Äô by an impostor, a condition known, after its first describer, as [Capgras syndrome](). Small perceptual changes seem to suggest a wholly different entity, not just a new bit of information that needs to be integrated into the whole: the significance of the part, in this sense, outweighs the pull of the whole.
