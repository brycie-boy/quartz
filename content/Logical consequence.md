## Logical consequence

Logical consequence is a fundamental concept in logic which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical arguement is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the [premise](Premise.md)s, because the conclusion is the consequence of the [premise](Premise.md)s. 

The philosphical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises? and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?
