[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md), so i would assume that the left hemisphere will also go out of its way to prove its pre-held beliefs. We can think of this process as involving two parts: the Thinker and the Prover. The Thinker can think just about anything, but the Prover is a much simpler mechanism and operates on one law only: what ever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves. If the Thinker thinks that the sun revolves around the earth, the Prover, our left [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), will obligingly organize all perceptions to fit that thought; if the Thinker changes its mind and decides that the earth revolves around the sun, the Prover will reorganize the evidence. If the Thinker thinks that "holy water" from Lourdes will cure its lumbago, the Prover will skillfully orchestrate the signals from the glands, muscles, organs, etc. until they have organized themselves into good health again.
