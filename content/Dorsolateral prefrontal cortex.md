## Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

![200](%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F%20Tools/%F0%9F%93%B8%20Images/6B47C9ED-4BA7-4B38-B4D4-4C57B8023ED9.png)

Our sense of justice is underwritten in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. With inactivation of this area, we act more selfishly. This is probably related to the right [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md)'s capacity to see the other's point of view ([The right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20the%20ability%20to%20put%20ourselves%20in%20anothers%20shoes.md)), and for empathy in general ([The right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20our%20capacity%20for%20emotional%20understanding.md)).
