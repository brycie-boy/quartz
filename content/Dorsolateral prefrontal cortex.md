Our sense of justice is underwritten in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. With inactivation of this area, we act more selfishly. This is probably related to the right [[frontal lobe]]'s capacity to see the other's point of view ([[The right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes]]), and for empathy in general ([[The right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding]]).
