## Serotonin-1a receptor  #🧠 

The [[serotonin]]-1a receptor seems to be uniquely involved in decreasing anxiety and mitigating [[depression]]. Rats who have had their [[Serotonin]]-1a [[receptor]]s genetically removed were extremely anxious. It’s the binding of [[serotonin]] to this [[receptor]] that is translated into well-being and contentment.
