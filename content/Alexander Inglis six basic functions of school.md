## Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school

[Alexander Inglis](Alexander%20Inglis.md) makes it perfectly clear that [public schools serve to manufacture a manageable population and to put down dissent and originality](Public%20schools%20serve%20to%20manufacture%20a%20manageable%20population%20and%20to%20put%20down%20dissent%20and%20originality.md): a fifth column into the burgeoning democratic movement that threatened to give the peasants and the [proletarians](Proletariat.md) a voice at the bargaining table. Modern, industrialized, compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical intervention into the prospective unity of these underclasses. Divide children by subject, by age-grading, by constant rankings on tests, and by many other more subtle means, and it was unlikely that the ignorant mass of mankind, separated in childhood, would ever reintegrate into a dangerous whole.

In his 1918 book, Principles of Secondary Education, Inglis breaks down the purpose of modern schooling into six basic functions. These are:

* [the adaptive function](The%20adaptive%20function.md)
* [the integrating function](The%20integrating%20function.md)
* [the differentiating function](The%20differentiating%20function.md)
* [the selective function](The%20selective%20function.md)
* [the propaedeutic function](The%20propaedeutic%20function.md)

That, unfortunately, is the purpose of mandatory public education in this country. And lest you consider Inglis an isolated crank with a rather too cynical take on the educational enterprise, you should know he was hardly alone in championing these ideas. [James Conant](), building on the ideas of [Horace Mann]() and others, campaigned tirelessly for an [America]()n school system designed along the same lines. Men like [George Peabody](), who funded the cause of mandatory schooling throughout the South, surely understood that the [Prussia]()n system ([The US public schooling system has its roots in Prussia](The%20US%20public%20schooling%20system%20has%20its%20roots%20in%20Prussia.md)) was useful in creating not only a harmless electorate and a servile labor force but also a virtual herd of mindless consumers. In time a great number of industrial titans came to recognize the enormous profits to be had by cultivating and tending such a herd via public education, among them [Andrew Carnegie]() and [John D. Rockefeller]().
