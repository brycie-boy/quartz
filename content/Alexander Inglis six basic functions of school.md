## Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school # 

[[Alexander Inglis]] makes it perfectly clear that [[public schools serve to manufacture a manageable population and to put down dissent and originality]]: a fifth column into the burgeoning democratic movement that threatened to give the peasants and the [[Proletariat|proletarians]] a voice at the bargaining table. Modern, industrialized, compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical intervention into the prospective unity of these underclasses. Divide children by subject, by age-grading, by constant rankings on tests, and by many other more subtle means, and it was unlikely that the ignorant mass of mankind, separated in childhood, would ever reintegrate into a dangerous whole.

In his 1918 book, Principles of Secondary Education, Inglis breaks down the purpose of modern schooling into six basic functions. These are:

- [[the adaptive function]]
- [[the integrating function]]
- [[the differentiating function]]
- [[the selective function]]
- [[the propaedeutic function]]

That, unfortunately, is the purpose of mandatory public education in this country. And lest you consider Inglis an isolated crank with a rather too cynical take on the educational enterprise, you should know he was hardly alone in championing these ideas. [[James Conant]], building on the ideas of [[Horace Mann]] and others, campaigned tirelessly for an [[America]]n school system designed along the same lines. Men like [[George Peabody]], who funded the cause of mandatory schooling throughout the South, surely understood that the [[Prussia]]n system ([[The US public schooling system has its roots in Prussia]]) was useful in creating not only a harmless electorate and a servile labor force but also a virtual herd of mindless consumers. In time a great number of industrial titans came to recognize the enormous profits to be had by cultivating and tending such a herd via public education, among them [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]].
