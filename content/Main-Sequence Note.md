“_And ... [[Urizen|god]] ended his work which he had made; and [[Novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar|he rested]] ..._”

The main-sequence stage is the third stage of the [[digestion]] in [☯️ The Flow](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Flow.md). A note enters the main-sequence when the [⛅️ Proto Note](Proto%20Note) begins to stabilize and consolidate into a clear and distinct idea. Being in a useful state, main-sequence notes are worthy of being submitted into my [[spaced repetition]] memory system. 

In order for a [⛅️ Proto Note](Proto%20Note) to receive main-sequence status, it must meet the following criteria:

- [[Main sequence notes should be atomic]]
- [[Main sequence notes should be concept oriented]]
- [[Main sequence notes should be densely linked]]
- [[Prefer positive notes titles to promote linking]]
- [[Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims]]
- [[Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies]]
