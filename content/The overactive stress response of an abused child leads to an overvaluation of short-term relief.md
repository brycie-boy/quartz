## The overactive stress response of an abused child leads to an overvaluation of short-term relief

A [brain](Brain.md) preset to be easily triggered into a stress response, such as when [a stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life](A%20stressful%20childhood%20can%20result%20in%20an%20overactive%20stress%20response%20in%20later%20life.md), is likely to assign a high value to substances, activities, and situations that provide short-term relief. It will have less interest in long-term consequences, just as people in extremes of thirst will greedily consume water knowing that it may contain toxins.

On the other hand, situations or activities that for the average person are likely to bring satisfaction are undervalued because, in the addict‚Äôs life, they have not been rewarding‚Äîfor example, intimate connections with family. This shrinking from normal experience is also an outcome of early trauma and stress. Neglect and abuse during early life may cause bonding systems to develop abnormally and compromise capacity for rewarding interpersonal relationships and commitment to societal and cultural values later in life. Other means of stimulating the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md), such as drugs, sex, aggression, and intimidating others, could become relatively more attractive and less constrained by concern about violating trusting relationships. The ability to modify behavior based on negative experiences may be impaired.

Hard-core drug [addicts](Addiction.md), whose lives invariably began under conditions of severe stress, are all too readily triggered into a stress reaction. Not only does the stress response easily overwhelm the addict‚Äôs already-challenged capacity for rational thought when emotionally aroused, but the [hormone]()s of stress also ‚Äúcross-sensitize‚Äù with addictive substances. The more one is present, the more the other is [craved](Craving.md). [Addiction](Addiction.md) is a deeply ingrained response to stress, an attempt to cope with it through self-soothing. Maladaptive in the long term, it is highly effective in the short term.
