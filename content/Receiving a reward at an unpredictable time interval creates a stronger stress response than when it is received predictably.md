## Receiving a reward at an unpredictable time interval creates a stronger stress response than when it is received predictably  # 

The fact that [[a lack of predictability as to when a stressor will occur has been shown to increase chronic stress]] is shown in an elegant, subtle study. A rat is going about its business in its cage, and at measured intervals the experimenter delivers a piece of food down a chute into the cage; rat eats happily. This is called an intermittent [[Operant conditioning|reinforcement]] schedule. Now, change the pattern of food delivery so that the rat gets exactly the same total amount of food over the course of an hour, but at a random rate. The rat receives just as much reward, but less predictably, and up go [[glucocorticoid]] levels. There is not a single physically stressful thing going on in the rat‚Äôs world. It‚Äôs not hungry, pained, running for its life‚Äînothing is out of allostatic balance. In the absence of any stressor, loss of predictability triggers a stress-response.
