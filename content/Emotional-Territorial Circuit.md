## Emotional-Territorial Circuit

The emotional-territorial networks of the brain are concerned entirely with power politics and is responsible for [clinging](Clinging.md). This ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù circuit is built into all vertebrates and is perhaps 500 million to 1000 million years old. In the modern human it seems to involve the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), the [basal ganglia](Basal%20ganglia.md), and the [motor cortex](), and is linked with the [somatic nervous system]() and the muscles. This circuit appears in each newborn when the DNA master tape sends out RNA messenger molecules to trigger the mutation from neonate to ‚Äútoddler,‚Äù which involves first of all standing erect. Walking, mastering gravity, overcoming physical obstacles and learning to manipulate others politically are the vulnerable points at which [imprint](Imprint.md)ing and heavy [conditioning](Conditioning.md) occur. The muscles that perform these power functions are quickly programmed with what become chronic, life-long reflexes. 

This circuit will organize itself into a strong, dominating role in the pack or a weak, submissive role. Status in the pack or tribe is assigned on the basis of preverbal signaling systems (kinesics) in which these muscle reflexes are crucial. All of the emotional games or cons listed in the popular psychological game-manuals of Dr. [Eric Berne]() and the Transactional Analysts are emotional-territorial [imprint](Imprint.md)s, or standard mammalian politics. The standard ‚Äúauthority‚Äù reflex on the emotional-territorial circuit is to swell the muscles and howl. You will find this among birds as well as mammals, and in the Board meeting of your local bank. The standard ‚Äúsubmission‚Äù reflex is to shrink the muscles, lower the head, and ‚Äúcrawl away.‚Äù You will find this among dogs, primates, fowl and employees who wish to keep their jobs everywhere. The emotional-territorial circuit is chiefly imprinted by the father‚Äîthe nearest alpha.

In pre-ethological terms, the emotional-territorial circuit is what we usually call ‚Äúego.‚Äù Ego is simply the mammalian recognition of one‚Äôs status in the pack; it is a ‚Äúrole‚Äù as sociologists say, a single brain circuit which mistakes itself for the whole Self, the entire brain-mind apparatus.
