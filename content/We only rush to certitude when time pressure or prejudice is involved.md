## We only rush to certitude when time pressure or prejudice is involved #üß†

Since [when a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challenges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain](When%20a%20system%20of%20thought%20becomes%20less%20than%20totally%20trivial,%20an%20infinite%20regress%20of%20challenges%20manifest%20and%20it%20becomes%20increasingly%20uncertain.md), a "common sense" attitude to any propositions of this nature would be consider them absurd and [jump out of the system](Jump%20out%20of%20the%20system.md). But any system which claims certianty must answer *all* challanges. Since this would take an infinite amount of time, it has not yet been performed, and the foundations of every mathematico-logical system today are increasingly considered formal [game rule](Game%20rule.md)s and not eternal "laws of thought" as they seemed to be.

In daily life and in "common sense" we generally maintain this degree of [model agnosticism](Model%20Agnosticism.md). We "expect the unexpected" and "keep our eyes and ears open," etc. We only rush to conclusions when we are under time pressure to make a quick decision or when prejudices are involved, as in religous or political controversy. When there is no existensial pressure for quick decisions, only prejudice asserts certitude.
