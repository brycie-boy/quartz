## We only rush to certitude when time pressure or prejudice is involved #üß† 

Since [[when a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challenges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain]], a "common sense" attitude to any propositions of this nature would be consider them absurd and [[jump out of the system]]. But any system which claims certianty must answer _all_ challanges. Since this would take an infinite amount of time, it has not yet been performed, and the foundations of every mathematico-logical system today are increasingly considered formal [[game rule]]s and not eternal "laws of thought" as they seemed to be.

In daily life and in "common sense" we generally maintain this degree of [[model agnosticism]]. We "expect the unexpected" and "keep our eyes and ears open," etc. We only rush to conclusions when we are under time pressure to make a quick decision or when prejudices are involved, as in religous or political controversy. When there is no existensial pressure for quick decisions, only prejudice asserts certitude.
