## Although the mentally ill were far less likely to have sex, eugenicists had rationalized the notion that they were breeding prolifically by proposing that it was the unsupervised ones that were doing so

[The eugenics movement had established the paradigm that mental illness was genetically inherited](The%20eugenics%20movement%20had%20established%20the%20paradigm%20that%20mental%20illness%20was%20genetically%20inherited.md). But if proving that insanity was inherited was difficult, [eugenicists](Eugenics.md) had an even harder time supporting the notion that the [mentally ill]() were prolific breeders. Even on the face of it, this seemed a dubious proposition. [Schizophrenics](), almost by definition, are socially withdrawn, which is just what researchers found time and again. A 1921 study determined that nearly two-thirds of males diagnosed as [schizophrenic]() had never even had sex with a woman. Other studies found that the “insane” were less likely to be married than the general population and had mortality rates five to fifteen times those of the normal population. Even psychiatrist [Paul Popenoe]() reluctantly concluded that the insane didn’t marry in great numbers and that they had so few children they didn’t reproduce their own numbers. They were worse breeders, in fact, than Harvard graduates and Mayflower descendants

However, such findings didn’t temper [eugenicists](Eugenics.md)’ call for sterilizing the [mentally ill]() . [Eugenicists](Eugenics.md) simply lumped them together with a larger group of misfits—the poor, criminals, and mentally handicapped—said to be siring offspring at great rates. [Popenoe]() argued that while the [mentally ill]()  in asylums—whose lives had been the subject of the research studies—may not have been good at breeding, those in the community were making up for their shortcomings. “Mentally diseased persons who do not get into state institutions and who have not been legally labeled insane seem to have families quite as large as the average, if not larger,” he said. “They are spreading defective [germ plasm]() continually through the sound part of the community, and many of them can be pointed out with probable accuracy through a study of their ancestry.” [What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves](What%20the%20Thinker%20thinks,%20the%20Prover%20proves.md).
