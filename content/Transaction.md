## Transaction  #🧠 

Transaction is a concept in [[Transactional Psychology]] that holds that perception is not passive re-action but active, creative trans-action because [[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]], and that the "observer" and "observed" must therefor be considered a [[Synergy|synergetic]] whole.
