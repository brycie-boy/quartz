## Ritalin # 

Ritalin is a [[stimulant]] acts as a [[dopamine]] [[reuptake inhibitor]]. At a therapeutic dose, it blocks 70 percent of the [[neurotransmitter transporters]] that remove [[dopamine]] from the [[Synapse|synaptic]] cleft and bring it back into the presynaptic [[neuron]]. [[Cocaine]] acts on the [[brain]] in the same way. However, Ritalin clears much more slowly from the [[brain]] than [[cocaine]] does, and thus it blocks [[dopamine]] reuptake for hours, as opposed to [[cocaine]]‚Äôs relatively brief disruption of this function

Ritalin and the other [[ADHD]] medications cause a long list of physical, emotional, and psychiatric adverse effects. The physical problems include drowsiness, appetite loss, lethargy, [[insomnia]], headaches, abdominal pain, motor abnormalities, facial and vocal tics, [[jaw]] clenching, skin problems, [[liver]] disorders, weight loss, growth suppression, [[hypertension]], and sudden [[heart|cardiac]] death. The emotional difficulties include [[depression]], apathy, a general dullness, mood swings, crying jags, irritability, anxiety, and a sense of hostility toward the world. The psychiatric problems include [[OCD]] symptoms, [[mania]], paranoia,[[psychosis]], and hallucinations. Ritalin also reduces blood flow and glucose metabolism in the [[brain]], changes that usually are associated with ‚Äúneuropathologic states.‚Äù
