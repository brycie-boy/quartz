## Maternal deprivation leads to reduced levels of oxytocin

One effect of early maternal deprivation appears to be a decrease in the production of [oxytocin](Oxytocin.md), one of our love [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s. It is critical to our experience of loving [attachment](Attachment.md)s and even to maintaining committed relationships. People who have difficulty forming intimate relationships are at risk for [addiction](Addiction.md); they may turn to drugs as social lubricants.
