## Stress and maternal deprivation in infancy and childhood leads to excess stress chemicals # 

[[A stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life]], and predictively maternal deprivation and other types of adversity during infancy and childhood result in chronically high levels of [[cortisol]]. Also, [[elevated levels of cortisol can shrink the hippocampus]], and [[the frontal cortex is equally vulnerable to shrinkage from cortisol as the hippocampus]]. Another major stress chemical that‚Äôs overproduced after insufficient early maternal contact is [[vasopressin]], which is implicated in high blood pressure.
