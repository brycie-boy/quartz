## Strong social support groups may sometimes only be about homogeneity, conformity, and xenophobia

[Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in primates](Having%20social%20support%20is%20shown%20to%20lower%20the%20stress-response%20in%20primates.md) [and humans](Having%20social%20support%20is%20shown%20to%20lower%20the%20stress-response%20in%20humans.md). Also, [the low social capital that comes with income inequality can lead to more stress and poor health](The%20low%20social%20capital%20that%20comes%20with%20income%20inequality%20can%20lead%20to%20more%20stress%20and%20poor%20health.md). So having a strong network of friends and being in a community teeming with [social capital](Social%20capital.md) can help with managing stress, but there is a potential downside. Amid all that nice, utopian [social capital](Social%20capital.md) business lurks the inconvenient fact that a tightly cohesive, cooperative community with shared values may only really be about homogeneity, [conformity](Conformity.md), and [xenophobia](Xenophobia.md). So [social capital](Social%20capital.md) isn‚Äôt always warm and fuzzy.
