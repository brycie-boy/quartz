## Wholesome kamma #‚è≥

Wholesome [kamma](Kamma.md) is an action that is beneficial to the agent, morally commendable, and brings pleasant fruits. It is [kamma](Kamma.md) that ripens into good fortune and happiness, or a "heavenly experience". The criterion for judging [kamma](Kamma.md) as wholesome is its underlying motives, or "roots"; these are [the three wholesome roots](The%20three%20wholesome%20roots.md). Wholesome kamma may be characterized as being in harmonony in the others, and thus is inline with [non-forcing](Non-forcing.md).
