## Safetyism got its foot in the door after Gen Z began to enter colleges in 2013 # 

The preoccupation with [[safetyism]] is clearest when [[Gen Z]]  started to enter colleges around 2013 . Psychologist [[Jean Twenge]] has shown that [[Gen Z]] suffers from far higher rates of anxiety and depression than did Millennials at the same age—and higher rates of suicide. Members of [[Gen Z]] are “obsessed with safety,” as Twenge puts it, and define safety as including “emotional safety.” [[Going into the twenty-first the concept of safety had expanded from physical safety to include emotional safety]]. Their focus on “emotional safety” leads many of them to believe that, as Twenge describes, “one should be safe not just from car accidents and sexual assault but from people who disagree with you.” Thus [[safe spaces allow for people to shield themselves from the discomfort of opposing views]]. The requests for safe spaces and trigger warnings started to spread only when [[Gen Z]] began arriving on campus around 2013. The demands for safety and censorship accelerated rapidly over the next four years as the last of the Millennials graduated, to be replaced by [[Gen Z]].
