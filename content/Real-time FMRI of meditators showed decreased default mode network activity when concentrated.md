## Real-time FMRI of meditators showed decreased default mode network activity when concentrated

Meditation researcher Dr. [Judson Brewer]() compared [brain](Brain.md) activity in novice and expert meditators using a real-time [fMRI]() neurofeedback showing whether [posterior cingulate cortex](Posterior%20cingulate%20cortex.md) activity was increasing or decreasing. The experts came in with an average of more than ten thousand hours of practice, whereas we taught the novices three types of meditation on the morning of their [fMRI]() scan. They set up a procedure in which I would see adjectives flash on a screen in the scanner for thirty seconds. The results showed a reduced response to the adjectives and decreased activity in the [medial prefrontal cortex]() and the [posterior cingulate cortex](Posterior%20cingulate%20cortex.md), the central hubs of the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), as people became more concentrated.
