## Use notes to avoid preconceived conclusions

When working on a writing projects, people generally begin with a conclusion or angle already in mind, and then [what the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves](What%20the%20Thinker%20thinks,%20the%20Prover%20proves.md). If we’re not careful, those preconceptions will distort our thinking. But if we begin by writing atomic [☀️ Main-Sequence Note](Main-Sequence%20Note)s, we can let the conclusions and topic *emerge* from our careful thinking.
