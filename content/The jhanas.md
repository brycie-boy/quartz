## The jhanas  #⏳

The jhanas are profound states of concentration in which the mind becomes fully obsorbed in its object. [The Buddha]() enumerates four jhanas, named simply after their numerical position in the series, each being more refined than its predecessor. These include: 

* [The first jhana](The%20first%20jhana.md) 
* [The second jhana](The%20second%20jhana.md) 
* [The third jhana](The%20third%20jhana.md)
* [The fourth jhana](The%20fourth%20jhana.md)
