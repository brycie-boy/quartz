## Those who make transgressions against their in-group sometimes make amends just by being antisocial towards out-groups # 

In-group obligation is shown by people feeling more need to make amends for transgressions against an [[In-group and out-group|Us]] than against a [[In-group and out-group|Them]]. For the former, people usually make amends to the wronged individual and act more prosocially to the group overall. But people often make [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] amends by being more antisocial to another group. Moreover, in such scenarios, the guiltier the person feels about their [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] violation, the worse they are to [[In-group and out-group|Thems]]. 

Thus, sometimes you help [[In-group and out-group|Us]] by directly helping [[In-group and out-group|Us]], sometimes by hurting [[In-group and out-group|Them]]. This raises a broad issue about [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] parochialism: is the goal that your group do well, or simply better than [[In-group and out-group|Them]]? If the former, maximizing absolute levels of [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] well-being is the goal, and the levels of rewards to [[In-group and out-group|Them]] is irrelevant; if the latter, the goal is maximizing the gap between [[In-group and out-group|Us]] and [[In-group and out-group|Them]]. Both occur. Doing better rather than doing well makes sense in zero-sum games where, say, only one team can win, and where winning with scores of 1‚Äì0, 10‚Äì0, and 10‚Äì9 are equivalent. Moreover, for sectarian sports fans, there is similar [[mesolimbic pathway]] activation when the home team wins or when a hated rival loses to a third party. This is schadenfreude, gloating, where their pain is your gain.

It‚Äôs problematic when non‚Äìzero sum games are viewed as zero-sum (winner-take-all). It‚Äôs not a great mind-set to think you‚Äôve won World War III if afterward [[In-group and out-group|Us]] have two mud huts and three fire sticks and [[In-group and out-group|They]] have only one of each. A horrific version of this thinking occurred late during World War I, when the Allies knew they had more resources (i.e., soldiers) than Germany. Therefore, the British commander, Douglas Haig, declared a strategy of ‚Äúceaseless attrition,‚Äù where Britain went on the offensive, no matter how many of his men were killed‚Äîas long as the Germans lost at least as many. So [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] parochialism is often more concerned about [[In-group and out-group|Us]] beating [[In-group and out-group|Them]] than with [[In-group and out-group|Us]] simply doing well. This is the essence of tolerating inequality in the name of loyalty. Consistent with that, priming loyalty strengthens [[In-group and out-group|in-group]] favoritism and identification, while priming equality does the opposite.
