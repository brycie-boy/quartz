## Those who make transgressions against their in-group sometimes make amends just by being antisocial towards out-groups

In-group obligation is shown by people feeling more need to make amends for transgressions against an [Us](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) than against a [Them](In-group%20and%20out-group.md). For the former, people usually make amends to the wronged individual and act more prosocially to the group overall. But people often make [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) amends by being more antisocial to another group. Moreover, in such scenarios, the guiltier the person feels about their [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) violation, the worse they are to [Thems](In-group%20and%20out-group.md). 

Thus, sometimes you help [Us](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) by directly helping [Us](In-group%20and%20out-group.md), sometimes by hurting [Them](In-group%20and%20out-group.md). This raises a broad issue about [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) parochialism: is the goal that your group do well, or simply better than [Them](In-group%20and%20out-group.md)? If the former, maximizing absolute levels of [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) well-being is the goal, and the levels of rewards to [Them](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) is irrelevant; if the latter, the goal is maximizing the gap between [Us](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) and [Them](In-group%20and%20out-group.md). Both occur. Doing better rather than doing well makes sense in zero-sum games where, say, only one team can win, and where winning with scores of 1‚Äì0, 10‚Äì0, and 10‚Äì9 are equivalent. Moreover, for sectarian sports fans, there is similar [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) activation when the home team wins or when a hated rival loses to a third party. This is schadenfreude, gloating, where their pain is your gain.

It‚Äôs problematic when non‚Äìzero sum games are viewed as zero-sum (winner-take-all). It‚Äôs not a great mind-set to think you‚Äôve won World War III if afterward [Us](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) have two mud huts and three fire sticks and [They](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) have only one of each. A horrific version of this thinking occurred late during World War I, when the Allies knew they had more resources (i.e., soldiers) than Germany. Therefore, the British commander, Douglas Haig, declared a strategy of ‚Äúceaseless attrition,‚Äù where Britain went on the offensive, no matter how many of his men were killed‚Äîas long as the Germans lost at least as many. So [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) parochialism is often more concerned about [Us](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) beating [Them](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) than with [Us](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) simply doing well. This is the essence of tolerating inequality in the name of loyalty. Consistent with that, priming loyalty strengthens [in-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) favoritism and identification, while priming equality does the opposite.
