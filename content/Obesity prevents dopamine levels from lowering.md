## Obesity prevents dopamine levels from lowering

Obesity reaks havick on the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) in very consitent ways. If your obese, you're already on the right side of the bell-shaped [dopamine](Dopamine.md) curve ([There must be a balanced amount of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway to prevent lethargy or irritablility](There%20must%20be%20a%20balanced%20amount%20of%20dopamine%20in%20the%20mesolimbic%20pathway%20to%20prevent%20lethargy%20or%20irritablility.md)). The [hormone]() [leptin](Leptin.md) normally reduces [dopamine](Dopamine.md) in the [ventral tegmental area](Ventral%20tegmental%20area.md) and moves you toward the left of the bell shaped curve (I want ice cream‚ÄîI ate ice cream‚Äîyay, ice cream!). But when your [neuron](Neuron.md)s are [leptin](Leptin.md) resisitant, as seen in chronic obesity, [leptin](Leptin.md) doesn't work; it can't extinguish that [dopamine](Dopamine.md) signal, [dopamine](Dopamine.md) stays high, and you're on your second, third, and force pint‚Äîhoping for an ever-dwindiling reward.
