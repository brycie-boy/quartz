## Amphetamines were first considered useful in treating hyperactive children when Charles Bradley gave them to students in 1937 # 

The notion that [[stimulant]]s might be beneficial for hyperactive children arose in 1937, when [[Charles Bradley]] gave a newly synthesized [[amphetamine]], [[Benzedrine]], to hyperactive children who complained of headaches. Although the drug didn’t cure their head pain, Bradley reported that it “subdued” the children and helped them concentrate better on their schoolwork. The children dubbed [[Benzedrine]] the “arithmetic pill.” Even today, [[Schools have found Ritalin to be useful in subduing hyperactive students and making them more easily manageable]].
