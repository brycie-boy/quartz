## Data mining and personalized algorithms create an online experience that is increasingly tailored to our interests

The data that we accumulate online is picked up by various data miners and is used to build a profile on us. This data is fed into algorithms and these algorithms manipulate what we see online according to our profiles. The result is that the internet you see is increasingly tailored to what your profile indicates your interests are. This leads to the phenomena that political activist Eli Pariser has called the "filter bubble": an internet optimized to your preferences where you never have to encounter an opinion you don't agree with and your [subjective bias](Subjective%20bias.md)es are continuously [reinforced](Operant%20conditioning.md) and amplified. This makes it harder to [actively try to confront new ideas and events that are opposed to your own beliefs and expectations](Actively%20try%20to%20confront%20new%20ideas%20and%20events%20that%20are%20opposed%20to%20your%20own%20beliefs%20and%20expectations.md). This process is also similar to how [our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important](Our%20brains%20unconsciously%20focus%20on%20only%20a%20select%20few%20of%20the%20sensory%20signals%20it%20receives%20that%20it%20considers%20important.md). On the large scale it is especially harmful, as it can lead to [echo chamber](Echo%20chamber.md)s.
