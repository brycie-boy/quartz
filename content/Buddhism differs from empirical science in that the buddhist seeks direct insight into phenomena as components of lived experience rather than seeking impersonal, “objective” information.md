## Buddhism differs from empirical science in that the buddhist seeks direct insight into phenomena as components of lived experience rather than seeking impersonal, “objective” information

For Early Buddhism, liberation requires direct knowledge and full understanding of the internal and external [six sense bases](Six%20sense%20bases.md) and all the phenomena that arise from them ([The contemplation the senses and the sensations that arise them from through the three characteristics can lead to nibbana](The%20contemplation%20the%20senses%20and%20the%20sensations%20that%20arise%20them%20from%20through%20the%20three%20characteristics%20can%20lead%20to%20nibbana.md)). This seems to  establish an apparent correspondence between Buddhism and empirical science, but the type of knowledge sought by the two disciplines differs. Whereas the scientist seeks impersonal, “objective” information, the Buddhist practitioner seeks direct [insight](Insight.md) into the nature of these phenomena as components of lived experience.
