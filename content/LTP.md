## LTP  # 

Long-term potenation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of [[synapse]]s based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of [[synapse|synaptic]] activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two [[neuron]]s. Long-term potenation is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory.

When the [[brain]] is called on to take in information, the demand naturally causes activity between [[neuron]]s. The more activity, the stronger the attraction becomes, and the easier it is for the signal to fire and make the connection. The initial activity marshals existing stores of [[glutamate]] in the [[axon]] to be sent across the [[synapse]] and reconfigures [[receptor]]s on the receiving side to accept the signal. The voltage on the receiving side of the [[synapse]] becomes stronger in its resting state, thereby attracting the [[glutamate]] signal like a magnet. If the firing continues, [[gene]]s inside the [[neuron]]’s [[cell]] nucleus are turned on to produce more building material for the [[synapse]]s, and it is this bolstering of the infrastructure that allows the new information to stick as a memory.

Say you’re learning a new word. The first time you hear it, [[neuron]]s recruited for a new circuit fire a [[glutamate]] signal between each other. If you never practice the word again, the attraction between the [[synapse]]s involved naturally diminishes, weakening the signal. You forget. Repeated activation, or practice, causes the [[synapse]]s themselves to swell and make stronger connections. A [[neuron]] is like a tree that instead of leaves has [[synapse]]s along its [[dendritic]] branches; eventually new branches sprout, providing more [[synapse]]s to further solidify the connections. These changes are a form of cellular adaptation called [[synaptic plasticity]].
