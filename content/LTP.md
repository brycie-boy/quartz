## LTP

Long-term potenation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of¬†[synapse](Synapse.md)s¬†based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of [synaptic](Synapse.md) activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two¬†[neuron](Neuron.md)s. Long-term potenation is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory.

When the [brain](Brain.md) is called on to take in information, the demand naturally causes activity between [neuron](Neuron.md)s. The more activity, the stronger the attraction becomes, and the easier it is for the signal to fire and make the connection. The initial activity marshals existing stores of [glutamate](Glutamate.md) in the [axon](Axon.md) to be sent across the [synapse](Synapse.md) and reconfigures [receptor](Receptor.md)s on the receiving side to accept the signal. The voltage on the receiving side of the [synapse](Synapse.md) becomes stronger in its resting state, thereby attracting the [glutamate](Glutamate.md) signal like a magnet. If the firing continues, [gene]()s inside the [neuron](Neuron.md)‚Äôs [cell]() nucleus are turned on to produce more building material for the [synapse](Synapse.md)s, and it is this bolstering of the infrastructure that allows the new information to stick as a memory.

Say you‚Äôre learning a new word. The first time you hear it, [neuron](Neuron.md)s recruited for a new circuit fire a [glutamate](Glutamate.md) signal between each other. If you never practice the word again, the attraction between the [synapse](Synapse.md)s involved naturally diminishes, weakening the signal. You forget. Repeated activation, or practice, causes the [synapse](Synapse.md)s themselves to swell and make stronger connections. A [neuron](Neuron.md) is like a tree that instead of leaves has [synapse](Synapse.md)s along its [dendritic]() branches; eventually new branches sprout, providing more [synapse](Synapse.md)s to further solidify the connections. These changes are a form of cellular adaptation called [synaptic plasticity](Synaptic%20plasticity.md).
