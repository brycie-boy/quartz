## Victim mentality

Victim mentality is a personality trait in which a person tends to recognize or consider themselves a victim of the negative actions of others, and to behave as if this were the case in the face of contrary evidence of such circumstances. Traits of victim mentality include:

* Constantly blaming other people or situations for feeling miserable
* Possessing a "life is against me" philosophy ([The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world](The%20more%20certain%20of%20our%20views%20we%20become,%20the%20more%20we%20perceive%20ourselves%20to%20be%20victims%20of%20an%20impersonal%20world.md))
* Feeling powerless to change one's circumstances
* Thinking others are purposely trying to hurt you
* Cynical and pessimistic 
* Enjoyment of sharing one's tragic stories with others
* Having a [habit](Habit.md) of blaming, attacking, or accusing loved ones for how they feel
* Constantly putting oneself down
* Believing your the only one being targeted for mistreatment
* Refusing to analyze your beliefs or improving your life
* Finds reasons to complain even when things go well

The victim stance is a powerful one because the victim is always morally right, neither responsible nor accountable, and forever entitled to sympathy.
