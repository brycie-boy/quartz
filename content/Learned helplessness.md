## Learned helplessness # 

Learned helplessness is the behavior exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated averse stimuli beyond their control. It was initially thought to be caused by the subject's acceptance of their powerlessness, by way of their discontinuing attempts to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented. Upon exhibiting such behavior, the subject was said to have acquired learned helplessness. For example, previous experiments have shows that [[Rats previously exposed to repeated uncontrollable stressors were shown to be unable to learn how to avoid shocks]]. [[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]], and their [[brain]]s fixate on negativity, reinforcing their negative [[subjective bias]]es, and ignoring the contrary.
