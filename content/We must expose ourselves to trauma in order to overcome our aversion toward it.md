## We must expose ourselves to trauma in order to overcome our aversion toward it # 

[[Seeing people as fragile leads to the notion that they must always be protected by discomfort]]. But human beings are not a candle flame. They are [[Antifragility|antifragile]]. This doesn't mean that we should _never_ protect people, but it does mean that the culture of safetyism is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature and of the dynamics of trauma and recovery. It is vital that people who have survived violence become [[habituation|habituated]] to ordinary [[Operant conditioning|cues]] and reminders woven into the fabric of daily life. Avoiding triggers is a symptom of [[PTSD]], not a treatment for it. Trigger warnings are counter-therapeutic because they encourage avoidance of reminders of trauma, and avoidance maintains [[PTSD]].  They should instead be dealing with it through treatments such as [[exposure therapy]]. Well-meaning people who work together to hide potential reminders of painful experiences, or who repeatedly warn the student about the possible reminders he or she might encounter, are only  [[enabling]] them.
