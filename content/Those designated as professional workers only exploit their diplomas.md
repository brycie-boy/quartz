## Those designated as professional workers only exploit their diplomas

If we mention that [a distinction between professional and simple work results in social inequalities](A%20distinction%20between%20professional%20and%20simple%20work%20results%20in%20social%20inequalities.md), we know the answer we will get from the collectivists. They will speak of ‚Äòscientific socialism‚Äô; they will quote [bourgeois](Bourgeoisie.md) economists, and [Marx]() too, to prove that a scale of [wage]()s has its raison d‚Äô√™tre, as ‚Äòthe labour force‚Äô of a professional worker will cost more to society than the ‚Äòlabour force‚Äô of the simple worker, and because the means to make a professional worker is greater than that necessary to make a simple worker. 

But if so-called profesional workers are paid ten or a hundred times more than a simple worker, it is not because of their ‚Äòcost of production‚Äô, but by reason of a monopoly of education, or a monopoly of industry. Professional workers merely exploit their [capital](Capital.md)‚Äîtheir diplomas‚Äîas employers exploit a factory, or as nobles used to exploit their titles of nobility (see [the wealth of the rich is derived from the poverty of the poor](The%20wealth%20of%20the%20rich%20is%20derived%20from%20the%20poverty%20of%20the%20poor.md)).
