## Those designated as professional workers only exploit their diplomas  # 

If we mention that [[a distinction between professional and simple work results in social inequalities]], we know the answer we will get from the collectivists. They will speak of ‘scientific socialism’; they will quote [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] economists, and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] too, to prove that a scale of [[wage]]s has its raison d’être, as ‘the labour force’ of a professional worker will cost more to society than the ‘labour force’ of the simple worker, and because the means to make a professional worker is greater than that necessary to make a simple worker. 

But if so-called profesional workers are paid ten or a hundred times more than a simple worker, it is not because of their ‘cost of production’, but by reason of a monopoly of education, or a monopoly of industry. Professional workers merely exploit their [[capital]]—their diplomas—as employers exploit a factory, or as nobles used to exploit their titles of nobility (see [[the wealth of the rich is derived from the poverty of the poor]]).
