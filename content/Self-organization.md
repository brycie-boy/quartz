## Self-organization  # 

Self-organization is a process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system. The process can be spontaneous when sufficient energy is available, not needing control by any external agent. It is often triggered by seemingly random [fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_fluctuations "Statistical fluctuations"), amplified by [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback "Positive feedback"). The resulting organization is wholly decentralized, [distributed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/distribute "wikt:distribute") over all the components of the system. As such, the organization is typically [robust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_(disambiguation) "Robust (disambiguation)") and able to survive or self-repair substantial perturbation.
