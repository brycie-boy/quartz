## Those who take their heaviest imprint on the Socio-Sexual Circuit tend to be very attractive

Persons who take their heaviest [imprint](Imprint.md) on the [Socio-Sexual Circuit](Socio-Sexual%20Circuit.md) are beautiful. That is, their entire body has received so many sexual neurotransmitters from the brain that they are constantly radiating the ‚Äúattractive‚Äù mating signals that make up our perception of what is ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù in a human being. According to accidents of [imprint](Imprint.md)ing, they can be coldly calculating exploiters, totally repressed Puritans or carry some other negative traits but they always look like (send the signals of) the ideal fucker-lover-protector.
