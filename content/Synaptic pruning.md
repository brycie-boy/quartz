## Synaptic pruning

[Synaptic](Synapse.md) pruning is the process in which [synaptic](Synapse.md) connections and circuits that are used frequently are strengthened, while unused ones are pruned out. [Much of the growth of the human brain occurs after birth](Much%20of%20the%20growth%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20occurs%20after%20birth.md), and In the early stages of life, the infant’s [brain](Brain.md) has many more [neuron](Neuron.md)s and connections than necessary—billions of [neuron](Neuron.md)s in excess of what will eventually be required. This overgrown, chaotic [synaptic](Synapse.md) tangle needs to be trimmed to shape the [brain](Brain.md) into an organ that can govern action, thought, learning, and relationships and carry out its myriad other tasks—and to coordinate them all in our best interests. Which connections survive depends largely on input from the environment. Both [neuron](Neuron.md)s and neural connections compete to survive and grow. Experience causes some [neuron](Neuron.md)s and [synapse](Synapse.md)s (and not others) to survive and grow.
