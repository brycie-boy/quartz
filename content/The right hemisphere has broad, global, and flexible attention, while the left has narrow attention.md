## The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention #🧠 

There is evidence of [[left hemisphere]] dominance for narrowly focused attention and [[right hemisphere]] dominance for broad, global, and flexible attention. The scope of the [[right hemisphere]]'s world is broad. Patients with a [[right hemisphere]] lesion (therefore relying on their intact [[left hemisphere]]) start with the pieces and put them together to get the overall picture, whereas those with a [[left hemisphere]] lesion (relying on their [[right hemisphere]]) prefer a global approach. Patients with [[right hemisphere]] damage don't seem able to adjust the breadth of the ‘spotlight’ of their attention: they suffer an excessive and more or less permanent narrowing of their attentional window. That's what happens when we have to rely on [[left hemisphere]] attention on its own.
