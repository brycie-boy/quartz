## Social identity theory

Social identity theory posits that our concept of who we are is heavily shaped by social context‚Äîby the groups we do or don‚Äôt identify with. From this view, [conformity has as much to do with safety as it does with avoiding punishment](Conformity%20has%20as%20much%20to%20do%20with%20safety%20as%20it%20does%20with%20avoiding%20punishment.md).
