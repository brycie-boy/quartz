## Sympathetic nervous system  # 
 
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the devisions of the [[autonomic nervous system]] . It is primarily involved in stimulating the "fight-or-flight" response. The sympathetic nervous system is described as being antagonistic to the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] which stimulates the body to "feed and breed" and to (then) "rest-and-digest". Inhalation has also been shown to activate the sympathetic nervous system.
