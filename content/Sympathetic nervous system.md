## Sympathetic nervous system

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the devisions of the [autonomic nervous system](Autonomic%20nervous%20system.md) . It is primarlity involved in stimulating the "fight-or-flight" response. The sympathetic nervous system is described as being antagonistic to the [parasympathetic nervous system](Parasympathetic%20nervous%20system.md) which stimulates the body to "feed and breed" and to (then) "rest-and-digest". Inhalation has also been shown to activate the sympathetic nervous system.
