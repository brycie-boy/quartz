## Aaron Rosanoff had adjusted the definition of mental illness to make his inheritance calculations more accurate in order to justify the sterilization of the mentally ill # 

The scientific justification for the compulsory sterilization of the severely [[mental illness|mentally ill]] rested on two premises: that “insanity” was an inherited disease and that the severely [[mental illness|mentally ill]] were proficient at the mating game and thus were passing on their tainted [[gene]]s to a large number of offspring. If either of these facts were not true, then the [[Eugenics|eugenicists]]’ argument that the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] were a threat to the country’s “[[germ plasm]]” would be seriously undermined.

Proving that insanity was an inherited disease fell to [[Aaron Rosanoff]], a doctor at Kings Park State Hospital in New York. Working under [[Charles Davenport]]’s tutelage, he charted the family histories of seventy-two insane patients. His initial results were not what he expected. Among the 1,097 relatives of the seventy-two patients, only forty-three had ever been hospitalized for a [[mental illness]]—a number far too low to show a causal [[gene]]tic link. Rosanoff calculated that according to [[Mendelian inheritance]], 359 of the relatives should have been [[mental illness|mentally ill]]. His study seemed to disprove the notion he’d set out to prove. Where had he gone wrong? 

The answer, he concluded, was that he had defined [[mental illness]] too narrowly. Plenty of mentally ill people were never hospitalized. Thankfully, [[the threshold for diagnosing mental disorders are somewhat arbitrary and can be adjusted]]. “Neuropathy,” he explained, manifested itself in many ways. Relatives of patients with manic-depressive insanity should be considered [[mental illness|mentally ill]] if they were “high-strung, excitable, dictatorial, abnormally selfish,” or if they had an “awful temper, drank periodically, [or] had severe blue spells.” In a similar vein, relatives of patients hospitalized for [[schizophrenia]] should be classified as neuropathic if they were “cranky, stubborn, nervous, queer, [or] restless,” if they were “suspicious of friends and relatives,” if they “worried over nothing,” or acted like “religious cranks.”

And with that neatly expanded definition of [[mental illness]] at work, [[Aaron Rosanoff|Rosanoff]] determined that the seventy-two hospitalized patients had 351 neuropathic relatives—almost an exact match to the number needed to support his hypothesis. “The hereditary transmission of the neuropathic constitution as a recessive trait, in accordance with the Mendelian theory, may be regarded as definitely established,” he happily concluded. [[When we mistake our models with reality itself, we stifle our capacity to learn new ideas]].
