## increased seretonin can decrease reward-seeking behaviors  #üß† 

The [[serotonergic pathway]] has the capacity to tame the [[mesolimbic pathway]]. Animal data has shown that the contentment from [[serotonin]] can reverse addictive behavior. [[Serotonin]] can speed up the breakdown and disposal of [[dopamine]], resulting in decreased [[dopamine]]-related reward signaling and reward-seeking behavior. In humans, we know that high levels of [[serotonin]] can decrease alcohol intake. Conversely, [[serotonin]] depletion (through experimental depletion of [[tryptophan]]) is associated with risky choice making.
