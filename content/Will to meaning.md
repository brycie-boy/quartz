## Will to meaning

Will to meaning is a term coined by [Viktor Frankl]() which refers to the idea that striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man. It is to be contrasted with the [will to pleasure]() in [Freud]()ian [psychoanalysis]() and to the [will to power]() in [Adler]()ian psychology.

The search for meaning is taken to be the primary motivation in ones life and not a “secondary [rationalization](Rationalization.md)” of instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by them alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy their own will to meaning. Some psychologists contend that meanings and values are “nothing but [defense mechanism]()s, [reaction formation]()s and [sublimation](Sublimation.md)s.” But, as Frankl put it, "as for myself, I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my “defense mechanisms,” nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my “reaction formations.” Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!"
