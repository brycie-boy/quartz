## Will to meaning # 

Will to meaning is a term coined by [[Viktor Frankl]] which refers to the idea that striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man. It is to be contrasted with the [[will to pleasure]] in [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]] and to the [[will to power]] in [[Alfred Adler|Adler]]ian psychology.

The search for meaning is taken to be the primary motivation in ones life and not a “secondary [[rationalization]]” of instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by them alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy their own will to meaning. Some psychologists contend that meanings and values are “nothing but [[defense mechanism]]s, [[reaction formation]]s and [[sublimation]]s.” But, as Frankl put it, "as for myself, I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my “defense mechanisms,” nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my “reaction formations.” Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!"
