## Experts have purpose and context in what they learn because they have chosen to learn it # 

There is another problem with how [[schools have extrapolated form chess professionals that storing information into long-term memory ahead of time will prepare them for expertise later]], which is that few people are obliged to play chess, as It‚Äôs not on the school curriculum. Those who become experts in playing chess are those who have chosen to put in the years of practice required. They're experts because they love playing chess and because people around them played chess with them. Their chess-playing has a purpose and context, But [[the cognitive science approach to learning strips it of it's context and meaning to the student]].
