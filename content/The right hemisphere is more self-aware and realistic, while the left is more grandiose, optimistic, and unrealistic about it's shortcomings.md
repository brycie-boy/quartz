## The right hemisphere is more self-aware and realistic, while the left is more grandiose, optimistic, and unrealistic about it's shortcomings # 

The [[right hemisphere]] is more realistic about how it stands in relation to the world at large, less grandiose, more self-aware, than the [[left hemisphere]]. The left hemisphere is ever optimistic, but unrealistic about its short-comings. When patients who have had a [[right hemisphere]] stroke are offered constructive guidance about their performance it makes little impact. In the words of one researcher into head injury, ‚Äòchildren with right-brain deficit disorder ignore task obstacles, accept impossible challenges, make grossly inadequate efforts, and are stunned by the poor outcomes. These children act fearless because they overlook the dangers inherent in the situation.‚Äô

A highly intelligent professional described by Stuss was completely unaware of his lack of capacity to do his job after the removal of a tumor in the right [[prefrontal cortex]]. When asked to role-play as an occupational health adviser to someone with his problems, he appropriately advised medical retirement, but when asked to apply this insight to his own situation he was completely unable to do so.
