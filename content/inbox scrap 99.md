I. Area Morality : This is the code of the "Slave-God  
s," very thoroughly analysed, pulverized, and de-loused b  
y Nietzsche in Antichrist. It consists of all the meanest v  
ices, especially envy, cowardice, cruelty and greed: all based o  
n over-mastering Fear. Fear of the nightmare type. With t  
his incubus, the rich and powerful have devised an engine t

2. Eight Lectures on Yoga gives a reasonable account of   
   the essence of this matter, especially in the talks on Y  
   ama and Niyama. (A book on this subject might well include a  
   few quotations, notably from paragraphs 8, 9, and 10 in t  
   he former.) It might be summarized as "doing that, and o  
   nly that, which facilitates the task in hand." A line of c  
   onduct becomes a custom when experience has shown that t  
   o follow it makes for success. "Don't press!" "Play with a  
   straight bat!" "Don't draw to five!" do not involve a  
   bstract considerations of right and wrong. Orthodox Hinduism h  
   as raped this pure system, and begotten a bastard code w  
   hich reeks of religion. A political manoeuvre of the B  
   rahman c

In the lands of Hinduism and (to a less extent) of I  
slam, the Sultan, the Dewan, the Maharajah, the Emir, o  
r whatsoever they call "the Grand Pandjandrum Himself, w  
ith the little round button on top," it is almost a 100 p  
ercent rule that the button works loose and is lost! Even in l  
ess exalted circles, any absolute ruler, on however petty a s  
cale, is liable to go the whole hog in an unexceptionably h  
oggish fashion. He has none to gainsay him, and he sees no r  
eason for controlling himself. This suits nearly everybody p  
retty well; the shrewd Wazir can govern while his "master" fills u  
p on "The King's Peg" (we must try one when champagne i  
s once again reasonably cheap) and all the other sensuous a  
nd sensual delights unstinted. The result is that by the time he i  
s twenty-he was probably married at 12-he is no longer fitted

465

Quite contrary to this is the career of the "Holy M  
an." Accustomed to the severest physical toil, inured to all t  
he rigours of climate, aloof from every noxious excess, he   
becomes a very champion of virility. More, he has b  
een particularly trained for this form of asceticism by all sorts of   
secret methods and practices; some of these, by the way, I  
was able to learn myself, and found surprisingly e

465

So we have the law of supply and demand at work as   
uncomplainingly as usual: the Holy Man prays for t  
he threatened Dynasty, blesses the Barren Queen ; and they all   
live happy ever after. This is not an Arabian Night's Tale o  
f Antiquity; it is the same to-day; there are very few   
Englishmen who have spent any time in India who have n  
ot been approached with proposals of this character.

465

Similar conditions, curiously enough, existed in Fran  
ce; the fils a papa was usually a hopeless rotter, and his w  
ife often resorted to a famous monastery on the Riviera, w  
here was an exceptionally holy Image of the Blessed Virgin M  
ary, prayers unto whom removed sterility. But when M. C  
ombes turned out the monks, the Image somehow lost its v  
irtue. Now get your Bible and turn up Luke VIII: 2! When t  
he sal volatile has worked, tum to John XIII: 2, 3 and ask a  
scholar what any Greek of the period would have u  
nderstood by the technical expressions there unambiguously e

465

Presently, I hope, you will begin to wonder whether, a  
fter all, the "morality" of the middle classes of the n  
ineteenth century, in Anglo-Saxon countries, is quite as axiomatic a  
s you were taught to s  
uppos

466

422

466

Perhaps we have now relaxed enough; we see that the   
"Holy man" is not such a fool as he looks; and we may g  
et on with our excursions into the "morality" of the Law of t  
he New Aeon, which is the Aeon of Horus, the crowned a  
nd conquering child ; and-.. The word of the Law is 9EA HMA.

3. So much of The Book of the Law deals directly o  
   r indirectly with morals that to quote relevant passages w  
   ould be merely bewildering. Not that this state of mind fails t  
   o result from the first, second, third and ninety-third perusals!  
   When Duty bellows loud "Thou m ust!"  
   The youth replies. "Pike's Peak or B  
   usti" is all very well, or might be if the bellow gave fur  
   ther particulars. And one's general impression may very well b  
   e that Thelema not only gives general licence to do any f  
   ool thing that comes into one's head, but urges in the m  
   ost emphatic terms, reinforced by the most eloquent appeals in   
   superb language, by glowing promises, and by c  
   ategorical assurance that no harm can possibly come thereby, t  
   he performance of just that specific type of action, the   
   maintenance of just that line of conduct, which is m  
   ost severely deprecated by the high priests and jurists of e  
   very religion, every system of ethics, that ever was under the sun

Shameful confession, one of my own Chelas (or so it i  
s r ather incredibly reported to me) said rece  
ntly: "Self-discipline is a form of Restriction." (That, y  
ou remember, is "The Word of Sin.") Of all the utter rubb  
ish! (Anyhow, he was a "centre of pestilence" for discussing t  
he Book at all.) About 90 percent of Thelema, at a guess, i  
s nothing but self-discipline. One is only allowed to d

Concentrate on "Thou hast no right but to do thy w  
ill." The point is that any possible act is to be performed if it is a  
necessary factor in that Equation of your Will. Any act t  
hat is not such a factor, however harmless, noble, virtuous o  
r what not, is at the best a waste of energy. But there are no   
artificial barriers on any type of act in general. The s  
tandard of conduct has one single touchstone. There may b  
e-there will be-every kind of difficulty in determining whether, b  
y this standard, any given act is 'right' or 'wrong'; but t  
here should be no confusion. No act is righteous in itself, but o  
nly in reference to the True Will of the person who proposes t  
o perform it. This is the Doctrine of Relativity applied to t  
he moral sphere.   
I think that, if you have understood this, the whole t  
heory is not within your g rasp; hold it fast, and lay about you

But as to your own wit of judgment as to the general ru  
les of your own private Code of Morals, what is 'right' and w  
hat is 'wrong' for you, that will emerge only from l  
ong self-analysis such as is the chief work of the Sword in t

Sin,   
astonishingly, means real! Curtius tells us "Language regards  
the guilty man as the man who it was." Then, what is 'guilt'  
? A.S. gylt, trespass; in our own Thelemic language, "  
deviation from (especially in the matter of excess, trespasser) the T  
rue Will." Please take notice that most of the words w  
hich denote misconduct imply wandering, either from the h  
ome or from the path: error, debauch, wrong (=twisted), wry, e  
vil (excessive) detraguer, go astray, and several others. So I t  
oo leap into the breach with Curtius, and point out t  
hat "Language itself asserts the doctrine of the True Will." B  
ut what says The Book of the Law? It is at pains to define Sin i  
n plain terms: "The word of Sin is Restriction." (AL, I: 4

"After aIJ," you tell me, "there is for every one of us a

I seem to have started up this rock chimney with the   
wrong leg! What I am trying to write is a sort of answer t  
o your remark about "Does the end justify the means?" and I  
had better tackle it straightfo  
rwardl

353

309

353

The Law of Thelema helps us to deal with this q  
uestion very simply and succinctly. First, it obviates the need o  
f defining the proper "End"; for with us this becomes ident  
ical with the "True Will"; and we are bound to assume that t  
he man himself is the sole arbiter; we postulate that his "End" i  
s self-jus

353

Then as to his "Means": as he cannot possibly know f  
or certain whether they are suitable or not, he can only rely on   
his inherited instincts, his learning, his traditions, and h  
is experience. Of these all but the first lie wholly in t  
he intellectual Sphere, the Ruach, and can accordingly be   
knocked into any desired shape at will, by dint of a l  
ittle manipulation ; and if Thelema has freed him morally, as i  
t should have done, from all the nonsense of Plato, M  
anu, Draco, Solon, Paul (with his harpy brood), John Stuart M  
ill, and Kant, he can make his decision with purely o  
bjective judgment. (Where would mathematics be if certain s  
olutions were a priori inadmissible?) But then, what about that plag  
uy first weapon in his armoury? It must be these i  
nstincts, simply because we have eliminated all the other p  
ossibilitie

353

What are t  
hey? Two are their sources: the spiritual (Neschamah) and t  
he physiological (Nephesch). Note that both these are f  
eminine. They pertain to He and He final in Tetragram  
maton respectively. That implies that they are, in a sense, i  
mposed on you from the beginning. Of course it is your own h  
igher principles, Yechidah and Chiah, that have saddled you w  
ith the m; but the "Human Consciousness," being in Tiphare  
th, cannot control Neschamah at all; and it has to be a  
dmirably unified, fortified, and perfected if it is to act efficiently u  
pon N  
ephesc

353

In practice, we most of us do act upon Nephesch a grea  
t deal. All learning, training, discipline, tend to modify our   
physiological reactions in a thousand minor manners. A

354

310

354

complete branch of Yoga, Hatha Yoga, is occupied w  
ith nothing else. And you can have your face "lifted." A  
part from this, we nearly all of us attend to matters like o  
ur waistline, our hours of sleep, our digestion, or our muscu  
lar development. Some men have even taught themselves t  
o reduce the pulse-beat both in rate and in volume; so much s  
o that they have sometimes been credited with the power t  
o stop the heart altogether at w  
il

354

Neschamah is an entirely different proposition. One o  
f Tiphareth's prime assets is the influence, through the path o  
f ''The Lovers'," from Binah. The son's milk from the G  
reat Mother. (From his Father, Chiah, Chokmah, he inherits the   
infinite possibilities of Nuit, through the path of He, '  
'The Star "; and from his "God," Kether, the D  
ivine Consciousness, the direct inspiration, guidance, and ward o  
f his Holy Guardian Angel, through the path of Gimel, t  
he Moon, "The Priestess.

354

Neschamah, then, will not be influenced by Ruach, e  
xcept in so far as it is explained or interpreted by Ruach. T  
hese "instincts" are implanted from on high, not from below; they   
would be imperative were one always sure of having received   
them pure, and interpreted them aright.

354

People spoke to me, people whose experience a

I cannot bear to do any unkind action, however w

stout antagonist in a fair figh

What one really needs to know is whether the protest of

First of all, one is tempted to argue t hat, that being s

uite uninitiated person-always provided that Thelema has fr  
eed him morally-should find that nine times in ten, the   
inhibiting antagonism is accidental, or at least a  
pparently irrelevant. (Notice, please, that our conditions of t

Suppose that by what is hardly fraud, but "

All the same, I say NO. I should never be the same m

s the spine of my work. No need that the fraud should b

But suppose that it were not the matter of gulling a

straightforward honest-to-God Bank Robbery under arms o

head, and the dice are loaded against me; nor does the d

martyred hero when the law of the country, less cogent t

My r etort, however, is convincing and final. Robbery in

356

any shape is a breach of the Law of Thelema. It i  
s interference with the right of another to dispose of h  
is property as he will; and if I did so myself, no matter w  
ith what tactical justification, I could hardly ask others t  
o respect my own similar right

356

So much for my own position; but let us look at t  
he original case with another protagonist: let us say a y  
oung Thelemite, fanatically enthusiastic and not very far a  
dvanced in the Path of Initiation. Suppose he argues: "To hell with

Who is going to balance that entry in his Karmic a

I have known strange, striking cases of similar "vows t  
o end vows." I need hardly say that these cases may b  
e multiplied indefinitely; nothing is easier, and few games more   
amusing, than to devise dilemmas calculated to stump t  
he Master, or to catch him bending.

356

Then-you ask-am I saying that the End does not justify  
the m  
eans? Hardly t  
hat. What I really mean is that these two terms a  
re unconnected. One decides about the "End" in one w  
ay: about the "Means" in another. But every proposition in y

Let us look into the matter. (First consult AL. II: 24, 2  
5, 48, 49, 58, 59, and III: 18, 58, 59. It might be confusing t  
o quote these texts in full; but they throw much further light  
on the subject.) The word "compassion" in its a  
ccepted sense-which is bad etymology-implies that you are a fin  
e fellow, and the other so much dirt; that is, you insult him b  
y pity for his misfortunes. But "Every man and every woman i  
s a star"; so don't you do it! You should treat everybody as a  
King of the same order as yourself. Of course, nine p  
eople out of ten won't stand for it, not for a minute; the mere f  
act of your treating them decently frightens them; their sense of   
inferiority is exacerbated and intensified; they insist o  
n grovelling. That places them. They force you to treat them a  
s the mongrel curs they are; and so everybody is h  
app

337

The Book of the Law is at pains to indicate the p  
roper attitude of one "King" to another. When you fight him, "As   
brothers, fight ye!" Here we have the old chivalrous type o  
f warfare, which the introduction of reason into the b  
usiness has made at the moment impossible. Reason and Emotio n;

these are the two great enemies of the Ethic of T  
helema. They are the traditional obstacles to success in Yoga as w  
ell as in M  
agic

338

Now in practice, in everyday life, this unselfishness i  
s always cropping up. Not only do you insult your b  
rother King by your "noble self-sacrifice," but you are a  
lmost bound to interfere with his True Will. "Charity" a  
lways means that the lofty soul who bestows it is really, d  
eep down, trying to enslave the recipient of his beastly bounty!

338

In practice, I begin afresh, it is almost entirely a matter o  
f the point of view. "That poor chap looks as if a square m  
eal wouldn't hurt him"; and you chuck him a half-crown. Y  
ou offend his pride, you pauperize him, you make a perfect c  
ad of yourself, and you go off with a glow of having done y  
our good deed for the day. It's all wrong. In such a case, y  
ou should make it the request for a favour. Say you're "  
dying for someone to talk to, and would he care to join you in a  
spot of lunch" at the Ritz, or wherever you feel that he w  
ill be t  
he hap

338

When you can do this sort of thing as it should be d  
one, without embarrassment, false shame, with your whole h  
eart in your words-do it simply, to sum up-you will f  
ind yourself way up on the road to that royal republic which i

Let me insist that "pity" is nearly always an impostor. I  
t is the psychic consolation for fear, the "pitiful man" really i  
s a pitiful man! He has transferred his own fear of what m  
ay happen to himself to another; for he is such a coward that h  
e dare not face his fear, even in imagination!

338

The day after I had written the above postscript I c  
ame upon a copy of Graham Greene's The Ministry of F  
ear-after a long search. He points out that pity is a mature e  
motion; adolescents do not feel it. Exactly; one step further, and he

would have reached my own position as set forth above. It i  
s the twin of "moral responsibility," of the sense of guilt or   
sin. The Hebrew fable of Eden and the "Fall" is c  
learly constructed. But remember that the serpent Nechesh WM l i  
s equivalent to Messiach, M"TP1' the Messiah. The M is t  
he "Hanged Man," the sinner; and is redeemed by the insert

An amusing coincidence. Just as I was polishing u  
p this letter the lady whom I had just engaged to help me w  
ith some of my work irritated me to the point when my s  
creams became so heartrending that the village will never sleep a  
gain as smoothly as its wont. They split the welkin in s  
everal places; and although invisible menders were immediately p  
ut on the job it is generally felt that it will never more be i  
ts own original w  
holeness. And why? Just because of her anxiety to please! She a  
sked me if she might do somefhing; I said "Yes"; she then went o  
n begging for my consent, explaining why she had made t

Concentration does indeed unlock all doors; it lies at t  
he heart of every practice as it is of the essence of all t heory;  
and almost all the various rules and regulations are aimed a  
t securing adeptship in this matter. All the s  
ubsidiary wor k- awareness, one-pointedness, mindfulness and t  
he rest-is intended to train you to t

I must keep always in mind that you are assumed to k  
now nothing whatever about Yoga or Magick, or anything e  
lse beyond what the average educated person may be assumed t  
o have been t  
aught. What is the problem? There are t  
wo. Beta: To train the mind to move with the maximum s  
peed and energy, with the utmost possible accuracy in the c  
hosen direction, and with the minimum of disturbance or frict  
ion. That is M  
agick. Alpha: To stop the mind altogether. That is Y  
oga. The rules, strangely enough, are identical in both cases; a  
t least, until your "Magick" is perfect; Yoga merely goes on a  
step further. In Beta you have reduced all movements from  
many to O ne; in Alpha you reduce that One to Z

181

Now then, with a sigh of relief, know you this: that e  
very possible incident in the Beta training is mutatis mutandis,  
perfectly familiar to the e  
ngineer. The material must be chosen and prepared in the kind a  
nd in the manner, best suited to the design of the i  
ntended machine; the various parts must be put together with t  
he utmost p recision; every obstacle to the function must b  
e removed, and every source of error eliminated. Now c  
heer up, child! In the case of a machine that he has devised a  
nd constructed himself with every condition in his favour, h  
e thinks he is doing not too badly if he gets some fifteen o  
r twenty percent of the calculated efficiency out of t  
he instrument; and even Nature, with millions of years to adj  
ust and improve, very often cannot boast of having done m  
uch better. So you have no reason to be discouraged if s  
uccess does not smile upon you in the first week or so of y  
our Work, starting as you do with material of whose p  
roperties you are miserably ignorant, with means pitifully limited, w  
ith Laws of Nature which you do not understand; in fact, w  
ith almost everything against you but indomitable Will a

There is only one method to adopt in such circ

"He that is not with me is against me." In all t

bad for you, or what is good for you. But I am not y ou; I   
don't know every detail of your life, every trick of y  
our thought. You must do ninety percent of the work fo

I want to insist most earnestly that concentration is not, a  
s we nearly all of us think, a matter of getting things right in  
the practices; you must make every breath you d  
raw subservient to the True Will, to fertilize the soil for t  
he practices. When you sit down in your Asana to quiet y  
our mind, it is much easier for you if your whole life has t  
ended to relative quietude; when you knock with your Wand t  
o announce the opening of an Invocation, it is better if t  
he purpose of that ceremony has been simmering in t  
he background of your thought since childhood!  
Yes i ndeed: background!  
Deep down, on the very brink of the subconscious, are a  
ll those facts which have determined you to choose this y  
our Great Work.  
Then, the ambition, conscious, which arranges the general   
order and disposition of your life.   
Lastly, the practices themselves. And my belief is that t  
he immense majority of failures have their neglect to brush u  
p their drill to thank for it.

For pure will, unassuaged of purpose. delivered from t  
he lust of result. is every way perfe  
ct. This, from a practical point of view, is one of the m  
ost important verses in the b  
ook. The unusual word unassuaged is very interesting. P  
eople generally suppose that 'will' is the slave of purpose, that y  
ou cannot will a thing properly unless you are aiming at a  
definite goal. But this is not the case. Thinking of the g  
oal actually serves to distract the mind. In these few words i  
s included the whole method without all the bombastic p  
iety of the servile doctrine of mysticism about the surrender o  
f the Will. Nor is this idea of surrender actually correct; t  
he will must be identified with the Divine Will, so-called. O  
ne wants to become like a mighty flowing river, which is n  
ot consciously aiming at the sea, and is certainly not yielding t  
o any external influence. It is acting in conformity with the l  
aw of its own nature, with the Tao. One can describe it, i  
f necessary, as "passive love"; but it is love (in effect) raised t  
o its highest potential. We come back to the same thing: when   
passion is purged of any "lust of result" it is irresistible; it h  
as become "Law." I can never understand why it is that m  
ystics fail to see that their smarmy doctrine of surrender a  
ctually insists upon the duality which they have set out to a

Please observe that the further you get on, the higher y  
our potential, the greater is the tendency to leak, or even t  
o break the containing vessel. I can help you by warning y  
ou against setting up obstacles, real or imaginary, in your o  
wn path ; which is what most people do. It is almost laughable t  
o think that the Great Work consists merely in "letting h  
er rip"; but Karma bumps you from one side of the t  
oboggan slide to the other, until you "come into the straigh  
t." (There's a chapter or two in The Book of Lies about this, but

As in the Yi King, the 3rd hexagram has departed from t

185

There is another way of defining the Great Work t  
hat explains to us the whole object of manifestation, of d  
eparting from the perfection of "Nothing" towards the perfection o  
f "everything," and one may consider this advantage, that it i  
s quite impossible to go wrong. Every experience, w

Naturally one cannot realize this until one becomes a  
Master of the Temple; consequently, one is perp

eal more to it than merely learning one's mistakes. One can n  
ever be sure what is right and what is wrong, until one appreciates

that "wrong" is equally "right." Now then one gets rid of t

The human apparatus is the best instrument of which w  
e are, at present, aware in our normal consciousness; but w  
hen you come to experience the Conversation of the hi

our faculties. It is true that you can project these intelligences a  
s parts of yourself, or you can suppose that certain h  
uman vehicles may be temporally employed by them for v  
arious purposes; but these speculations tend to be idle. The   
important thing is to make contact with beings, w  
hatever their nature, who are superior to yourself, not merely i  
n degree but in kind. That is to say, not merely different as a  
Great Dane differs from a Chihuahua, but as a buffalo d

Of course you are perfectly right about the senses, t  
hough I would not agree to confine the meaning to the five w  
hich are common to most people. There must, one might susp  
ect, be ways of apprehending directly such phenomena a  
s magnetism, electrical resistance, chemical affinity and t  
he like. Let me direct you once more to The Book of the L

The mystic's idea of deliberately stupefying and stultifying   
himself is an "abomination unto the Lord." This, by the w  
ay, does not conflict with the rules of Yoga. That kind o  
f suppression is comparable to the restrictions in a  
thletic training, or diet in s

187

Now we get back to the Qabalah-how to make use of it.   
Let us suppose that you have been making an i  
nvocation, or shall we call it an investigation, and suppose you want t  
o interpret a passage of Bach. To play this is the p  
rincipal weapon of your ceremony. In the course of your operation,  
you assume your astral body and rise far above the terrestrial   
atmosphere, while the music continues softly in the   
background. You open your eyes, and find that it is n  
ight. Dark clouds are on the horizon; but in the zenith is a c  
rown of constellations. This light helps you, especially as your eyes   
become accustomed to the gloom, to take in y  
our surroundings. It is a bleak and barren landscape. T  
errific mountains rim the world. In the midst looms a cluster o  
f blue·black crags. Now there appears from their recesses a  
gigantic being. His strength, especially in his hands and in h  
is loins, is terrifying. He suggests a combination of l  
ion, mountain goat and serpent; and you instantly jump to the   
idea that this is one of the rare beings which the G  
reeks called Chimaera. So formidable is his appearance that you   
consider it prudent to assume an appropriate god·form. B  
ut who is the appropriate god? You may perhaps consider i  
t best, in view of your complete ignorance as to who he is a  
nd where you are, to assume the god·form of Harpocrates, a  
s being good defence in any case; but of course this will n  
ot take you very far. If you are sufficiently curious and bold

188

146

188

you will make up your mind rapidly on this point. This i  
s where your daily practice of the Qabalah will come in usefu  
l. You run through in your mind the seven sacred planets. T  
he very first of them seems quite consonant with what you h  
ave so far seen. Everything suits Saturn well enough. To be o  
n the safe side, you go through the others; but this is a v  
ery obvious case-Saturn is the only planet that agrees w  
ith everything. The only other possibility will be the Moon; b  
ut there is no trace noticeable of any of her more amiable   
characteristics. You will therefore make up your mind that i  
t is a Saturnian god-form that you need. Fortunate indeed f  
or you that you have practised daily the assumption of s  
uch forms! Very firmly, very steadily, very slowly, very q  
uietly, you transform your normal astral appearance into that o  
f Sebek. The Chimaera, recognizing your divine a  
uthority, becomes less formidable and menacing in appearance. H  
e may, in some way, indicate his willingness to serve you. V  
ery good, so far; but it is of course the first essential to make s  
ure of his integrity. Accordingly you begin by asking his n  
ame. This is vital; because if he tells you the truth, it gives y  
ou power over him. But if, on the other hand, he tells you a l  
ie, he abandons for good and all his fortress. He becomes r  
ather like a submarine whose base has been destroyed. He may d  
o you a lot of mischief in the meantime, of course, so look o

another, "The Way"; another "Tat" or "Shiva". These are all   
true in one sense or another. My own "White Hope" (see The  
Book of Thoth) is to identify it with the Qabalistic Z

hard practical reasons; it is an assumption which indicates the

The Book of the Law states the doctrine of Tao v  
ery s uccinctly; "Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do t  
hat and no other shall say nay. For pure will, unassuaged o  
f purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every w  
ay perfect." (AL, I: 4  
2-44) "Thus also the Sage, seeking not any goal, attaineth all   
things; he does not interfere in the affairs of his body, and so   
that body acteth without friction. It is because he meddl  
eth not with his personal aims that these come to pass w  
ith simplicity." (The Tao Teh King, VII: 2

270

The ideal analogy seems to be that of a planet in its o  
rbit. It has its "true motion"; it meets the minimum of fri  
ction from circumambient space. When it suffers the attraction o  
f another body, it sways slightly to make the p  
roper adjustment without effort or argu ment; it can, c  
onsequently, continue indefinitely in its o  
rbi

270

This is roughly the plan of the Taoist in his attitude to l  
ife. Having ascertained the Path which satisfies the equations o  
f his Nature (as we say, "found his True Will") he c  
ontinues "without lust of result," acting only when it happens to be  
necessary to adjust himself to any external stress that affe  
cts him, and so proceeds h  
appily thinking of a w  
ay To feed oneself on b  
atter, And so go on from day to da  
y Getting a little fat  
ter. -assuming that his ''True Will" is of that variety. Basil K  
ing Lamus asserts this in The Diary of a Drug Fiend when h  
e says: "If I were a dog, I should bark; if I were an owl, I

should hoot." It is rather like the pattern in the game o  
f dominoes; you put the card that matches. No o

271

It is the extreme simplicity of this idea which b  
affles people's minds, and the universal quality of impatience which   
makes everybody fidget, and so injure the delicacy of t  
he "fine adjustment" which is the essence of the w  
ork. As I said above, it is a matter of Neschamah; but w  
hat follows may help y

Why is the Tao translated "Reason"? Because b  
y "Reason" is here meant the structure of the mind itself; a  
Buddhist who had succeeded with Mahasatipatthana might   
call it the Consciousness of the Tendency to Perceive the   
Sensation of Anything. For in the last resort, and through the   
pursuit of one line of analysis, this structure is all that we can   
call our consciousness. Everything of which we can in a  
ny way be aware may be interpreted as being some function o  
f this s  
tructure. Note! Function. For now we see why Tao may also b  
e translated "The Way"; for it is the motion of the s  
tructure that we observe. There is no Being apart from G  
oin

271

You are familiar with the Four Powers of the S  
phinx, attributed by the Adepts of old time to their Four E  
lements. Air is to Know, Scire; Fire is to Will, Veile; Water is to Dare,  
Audere; and Earth is to Keep Silence, Tacere. But now that a   
fifth Element, Spirit, is generally recognized in the Qabalah, I  
have deemed it proper to add a Fifth Power correspo  
nding: to Go, Ire. (The Book of Thoth, p. 2  
7

271

Then, as Spirit is the Origin, the Essence, and the Sum o  
f the other four, so is to Go in relation to those powers. A  
nd to Go is the very meaning of the name God, as else  
where shewn in these letters; hence the Egyptian Gods w  
ere signalized as such by their bearing the Ankh, which is a  
Sandal·strap, and in its form the Crux Ansata, the R  
osy Cross, the means whereby we demonstrate the Godhead o  
f our Nature. See then how sweetly each idea slides into t  
he next! How right this is, that the Quintessence should be

272

230

272

dynamic and not static! For if there were some form of B  
eing separate from Going, it would necessarily be subject t  
o decay; and, in any case, a thing impossible to apprehend  
, since apprehension is itself an Act, not an idea i  
mmobile which would be bound to change in the very moment o  
f grasping i

272

As I have tried to show in another letter, t  
he "Point-Event" (or whatever it is) of which we are aware is a   
change, or, less inaccurately, the memory of one; the t  
hings that change remain relentlessly unknown.

The v  
ery first word "Tao" presented a completely insoluble p  
roblem. It had been translated "Reason," "The Way," ''TO O  
N." None of these convey any true conception of the Tao.

276

The Tao is Reason in this sense, that the substance o  
f things may be in part apprehended as being that n  
ecessary relation between the elements of thought which d  
etermines the laws of reason. In other words, the only reality is t  
hat which compels us to connect the various forms of illusion a  
s we do. It is thus evidently unknowable, and expre  
ssible neither by speech nor by silence. All that we can know a  
bout it is that there is inherent in it a power (which however is n  
ot itself) by virtue whereof all beings appear in forms c  
ongruous with the nature of necessity.

276

The Tao is also "the Way"-in the following sense. N  
othing exists except as a relation with other similarly post  
ulated ideas. Nothing can be known in itself, but only as one of t  
he participants in a series of events. Reality is therefore in t  
he motion, not in the things moved. We cannot a  
pprehend anything except as one postulated element of an o  
bserved impression of c  
hang

276

We may express this in other terms as follows. O  
ur knowledge of anything is in reality the sum of o  
ur observations of its successive movements, that is to say, of i  
ts path from event to event. In this sense the Tao may b  
e translated as "the Way." It is not a thing in itself in the s  
ense of being an object susceptible of apprehension by sense o  
r mind. It is not the cause of any thing; it is rather the c  
ategory underlying all existence or event, and therefore true and r  
eal as they are illusory, being merely landmarks invented f  
or convenience in describing our experiences. The Tao p  
ossesses no power to cause anything to exist or to take place. Yet our   
experience when analyzed tells us that the only reality o  
f which we may be sure is this path or Way which resumes t  
he whole of our knowledge

277

As for TO ON, which superficially might seem the b  
est translation of Tao as described in the text, it is the m  
ost misleading of the three. For TO ON possesses an exten  
sive connotation implying a whole system of Platonic c  
oncepts, than which nothing can be more alien to the essential q  
uality of the Tao. Tao is neither 'being' nor 'not being' in any s  
ense which Europe could understand. It is neither existence, nor a  
condition or form of existence. Equally, TO MH ON gives n  
o idea of Tao. Tao is altogether alien to an that class o  
f thought. From its connection with "that principle w  
hich necessarily underlies the fact that events occur" one m  
ight suppose that the "Becoming" of Heraclitus might assist us t  
o describe the Tao. But the Tao is not a principle at an of t  
hat kind. To understand it requires an altogether different s  
tate of mind to any with which European thinkers in g  
eneral are familiar. It is necessary to pursue unflinchingly the path o  
f spiritual development on the lines indicated by the Sufis, t  
he Hindus, and the Buddhists; and, having reached the t  
rance called Nerodha-Sammapati, in which are destroyed all fo  
rms soever of consciousness, there appears in that abyss o  
f annihilation the germ of an entirely new type of idea, w  
hose principal characteristic is this: that the entire c  
oncatenation of One's previous experiences and conceptions could n  
ot have happened at all, save by virtue of this i  
ndescribable n  
ecessit

277

It must also prove a  
lmost wholly unintelligible to the average reader, him in fact w  
hom I especially aim to i  
nterest. For his sake I will try to elucidate the matter by a  
n analogy. Consider electricity. It would be absurd to say t  
hat electricity is any of the phenomena by which we know it. W  
e take refuge in the petitio principii of saying that electricity is   
that form of energy which is the principal cause of such a  
nd such phenomena. Suppose now that we eliminate this idea as

278

236

278

evidently illogical. What remains? We must not hastily a  
nswer "Nothing remains." There is some thing inherent in t  
he nature of consciousness, reason, perception, sensation, and o  
f the universe of which they inform us, which is responsible fo  
r the fact that we observe these phenomena and not o  
thers; that we reflect upon them as we do, and not otherwise. B  
ut, even deeper than this, part of the reality of the i  
nscrutable energy which determined the form of our experi  
ence, consists in determining that experience should take place a  
t all. It should be clear that this has nothing to do with any o  
f the Platonic conceptions of the nature of t  
hing

278

The least abject asset in the intellectual bankruptcy o  
f European thought is the Hebrew Qabalah. P  
roperly understood, it is a system of symbolism indefinitely e  
lastic, assuming no axioms, postulating no principles, asserting n  
o theorems, and therefore adaptable, if managed adroitly, t  
o describe any conceivable doctrine. It has been my c  
ontinual study since 1898, and I have found it of infinite value in t  
he study of The Tao Teh King. By its aid I was able to a  
ttribute the ideas of Lao-tze to an order with which I was exceedin  
gly familiar, and whose practical worth I had repeatedly p  
roved by using it as the basis of the analysis and classification of a  
ll Aryan and Semitic religions and philosophies. Despite t  
he essential difficulty of correlating the ideas of Lao-tze w  
ith any others, the persistent application of the Qabalistic k  
eys eventually unlocked his treasure-house. I was able to explai  
n to myself his teachings in terms of familiar s

278

This achievement broke the back of my Sphinx. H  
aving once reduced Lao-tze to Qabalistic form, it was easy t  
o translate the result into the language of philosophy. I h  
ad already done much to create a new language based on E  
nglish with the assistance of a few technical terms borrowed fr  
om Asia, and above all by the use of a novel conception of t  
he idea of Number and of algebraic and arithmetical p  
rocedure to convey the results of spiritual experience to i  
ntelligent s

present this translation of The Tao Teh King to the public. I  
hope and believe that careful study of the text, as e  
lucidated by my commentary, will enable serious aspirants to t  
he hidden Wisdom to understand (with fair accuracy) what   
Lao-tze taught. It must however be laid to heart that the   
essence of his system will inevitably elude i  
ntellectual apprehension, unless it be illuminated from above by a  
ctual living experience of the truth. Such experience is only to be  
attained by unswerving application to the practices which h  
e advocates. Nor must the aspirant content himself with t  
he mere attainment of spiritual enlightenment, however s  
ublime. All such achievements are barren unless they be regarded as   
the means rather than the end of spiritual progress; a  
llowed to infiltrate every detail of the life, not only of the spirit, b  
ut of the senses. The Tao can never be known until it i  
nterprets the most trivial actions of every day routine. It is a fa  
tal mistake to discriminate between the spiritual importance of   
meditation and playing golf. To do so is to create an i  
nternal conflict. "Let there be no difference made among y  
ou between any one thing & any other thing, for thereby t  
here cometh hurt." He who knows the Tao knows it to be t  
he source of all things soever; the most exalted spiritual e  
cstasy and the most trivial internal impression are from our point of   
view equally illusions, worthless masks, which hide, w  
ith grotesque painted pasteboard false and lifeless, the living face   
of truth. Yet, from another point of view, they are equally   
expressions of the ecstatic genius of truth-natural images of   
the reaction between the essence of one's self and o  
ne's particular environment at the moment of their o  
ccurrence. They are equally tokens of the Tao by whom, in whom, a  
nd of whom, they are. To value them for themselves is to d  
eny the Tao and to be lost in delusion. To despise them is to d  
eny the omnipresence of the Tao, and to suffer the illusion o  
f sorrow. To discriminate between them is to set up t  
he accursed dyad, to surrender to the insanity of intellect, t  
o overwhelm the intuition of truth, and to create civil war i

There is to-day much misunderstanding of the meaning o  
f the term 'Magick'. Many attempts have been made to d  
efine it, but perhaps the best for our present purpose o  
f historical-ideological exposition will be this-Magick is t  
he Science of the lncom  
mensurables. This is one of the many restricted uses of the word; o  
ne suited to the present p

106

It is particularly to be noted that Magick, so often mixe  
d up in the popular idea of religion, has nothing to do with i  
t. It is, in fact, the exact opposite of relig ion; it is, even m  
ore than Physical Science, its irreconcilable e  
nemy. Let us define this difference clearl

106

Magick investigates the laws of Nature with the idea o  
f making use of them. It only differs from 'profane' science by   
always keeping ahead of it. As Fraser has shown, Magick i  
s science in the tentative stage; but it may be, and often i  
s, more than this. It is science which, for one reason or a  
nother, cannot be declared to the p  
rofan

106

Religion, on the contrary, seeks to ignore the laws o

107

107

Nature, or to escape them by appeal to a postulated p  
ower which is assumed to have laid them down. The religious m  
an is, as such, incapable of understanding what the laws o  
f Nature really are. (They are generalizations from the order o  
f observed f

107

The History of Magick has never been seriously attempted.  
For one reason, only initiates pledged to secrecy know m  
uch about i t; for another, every historian has been talking a  
bout some more or less conventional idea of Magick, not of t  
he thing itself. But Magick has led the world from before t  
he beginning of history, if only for the reason that Magick has   
always been the mother of Science. It is, therefore, o  
f extreme importance that some effort should be made t  
o understand something of the subject; and there is, t  
herefore, no apology necessary for essaying this brief outline of i  
ts historical a

There have always been, at least in nucleus, three m  
ain Schools of Philosophical practice. (We use the w  
ord 'phi1osophical' in the old good broad sense, as in the p  
hrase "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for the   
Advancement of Knowledge.")  
It is customary to describe these three Schools as Y  
ellow, Black and W

107

These Schools represent three perfectly distinct a  
nd contrary theories of the Universe , and, therefore, practices o  
f spiritual science. The magical formula of each is as precise a  
s a theorem of trigonometry. Each assumes as fundamental a  
certain law of Nature, and the subject is complicated by t  
he fact that each School, in a certain sense, admits the fo  
rmulae of the other two. It merely regards them as in some w  
ay incomplete, secondary, or illusory. Now, as will be seen later

108

66

108

the Yellow School stands aloof from the other two by t  
he nature of its postulates. But the Black School and the W  
hite are always more or less in active conflic t; and it is b  
ecause just at this moment that conflict is approaching a climax t  
hat it is necessary to write this essay. The adepts of the W  
hite School consider the present danger to mankind so great t  
hat they are prepared to abandon their traditional policy o  
f silence, in order to enlist in their ranks the profane of e

We are in possession of a certain mystical d  
ocument2 which we may describe briefly, for convenience sake, as a  
n Apocalypse of which we hold the keys, thanks to t  
he intervention of the Master who has appeared at this gr  
ave conjuncture of Fate. This document consists of a series o  
f visions, in which we hear the voice of the v  
arious Intelligences whose nature it would be hard to define, b  
ut who are at the very least endowed with knowledge and p  
ower far beyond anything that we are accustomed to regard a  
s proper to the human race.

We must quote a passage from one of the most i  
mportant of these documents. The doctrine is conveyed, as i  
s customary among Initiates, in the form of a parable. Those   
who have attained even a mediocre degree of enlight  
enment are aware that the crude belief of the faithful, and the c  
rude infidelity of the scoffer, with regard to matters of fact, are   
merely childish. Every incident in Nature, true or fals  
e, possesses a spiritual significance. It is this significance, a  
nd only this significance, that possesses any philosophical v  
alue to the I  
nitiat

The orthodox need not be shocked, and the e  
nlightened need not be contemptuous, to learn that the passage w  
hich we are about to quote, is a parable based on the l

decorous of the Biblical legends which refer to Noah. I

Here follows the excerpt from the Vision:   
And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover t  
he nakedness of the Most High, for he is drnnken upon t  
he wine that is the blood of the adepts. And BABALON  
hath lulled him to sleep upon her breast, and she hath   
fled away, and left him naked, and she hath called h  
er children together saying: Come up with me, and let u  
s make a mock of the nakedness of the Most Hig  
h. And the first of the adepts covered His shame with a  
cloth, walking backwards, and was white. And the   
second of the adepts covered His shame with a clot  
h, walking sideways, and was yellow. And the third of t  
he ade pts made a mock of His nakedness, w  
alking forwards, and was black. And these are the three g  
reat schools of the Magi, who are also the three Magi t  
hat journeyed unto Bethlehem; and because thou hast n  
ot wisdom, thou shalt not know which school prevaileth,  
or if the three schools be not o

109

We are now ready to study the philosophical bases of t  
hese three Schools. We must, however, enter a caveat against t  
oo literal an interpretation, even of the parable. It may b  
e suspected, for reasons which should be apparent after furt  
her investigation of the doctrines of the Three Schools, that t  
his parable was invented by an Intelligence of the Black S  
chool, who was aware of his iniquity, and thought to transform i  
t into righteousness by the alchemy of making a boast of i  
t. The intelligent reader will note the insidious attempt t  
o identify the doctrine of the Black School with the kind o  
f black magic that is commonly called Diabolism. In o  
ther words, this parable is itself an example of an exceedin  
gly subtle black magical operation, and the contemplation o  
f such devices carried far enough brings us to an under  
standing of the astoundingly ophidian processes of Magicians. Let not

110

68

110

the profane reader dismiss such subtleties from his mind a  
s negligible nonsense. It is cunning of this kind that d  
etermines the price of p  
otatoe

110

The above digression is perhaps not so inexcusable as i  
t may seem on a first reading. Careful study of it should r  
eveal the nature of the thought-processes which are habitually used   
by the secret Masters of the human race to determine i  
ts destiny.  
When everyone has done laughing, I will ask you t  
o compare the real effects produced on the course of h  
uman affairs by Caesar, Attila, and Napoleon, on the one hand; o  
f Plato, the Encyclopaedists, and Karl Marx3 on the o

110

The Yellow School of Magick considers, with c  
omplete scientific and philosophical detachment, the fact of t  
he Universe as a fact. Being itself a part of that Universe, i  
t realizes its impotence to alter the totality in the s  
mallest degree. To put it vulgarly, it does not try to raise itself from   
the ground by pulling at its socks. It therefore opposes to t  
he current of phenomena no reaction either of hatred or o  
f sympathy. So far as it attempts to influence the course o  
f events at all, it does so in the only intelligent w  
ay conceivable: it seeks to diminish internal friction.

110

It remains, therefore, in a contemplative attitude. To u  
se the terms of Western philosophy, there is in its a  
ttitude something of the stoicism of Zeno; or of the P  
ickwickianism, if I may use the term, of Epicurus. The ideal reaction t  
o phen o mena is that of perfect elasticity. It poss  
esses something of the cold-bloodedness of mathematics; and f  
or this reason it seems fair to say, for the purposes o  
f elementary study, that Pythagoras is its most a  
dequate exponent in European philosophy.

Since the discovery of Asiatic thought, however, we h

It is impossible to find any religion which adequ  
ately represents the thought of this masterpiece. Not only i  
s religion as such repugnant to science and philosophy, b  
ut from the very nature of the tenets of the Yellow School, i  
ts adherents are not going to put themselves to a  
ny inconvenience for the enlightenment of a lot of people w  
hom they consider to be hopeless fo

111

At the same time, the theory of religion, as such, being a  
tissue of falsehood, the only real strength of any religion i  
s derived from its pilferings of Magical doctrine; and, religi  
ous persons being by definition entirely unscrupulous, it fo  
llows that any given religion is likely to contain scraps of M  
agical doctrine, filched more or less haphazard from one school o  
r the other as occasion s  
erve

111

Let the reader, therefore, beware most seriously of t  
rying to get a grasp of this subject by means of siren a  
nalogies. Taoism has as little to do with The Tao Teh King as t  
he Catholic Church with the G  
ospe

111

The Tao Teh King inculcates conscious inaction, or r  
ather unconscious inaction, with the object of minimizing t  
he disorder of the world. A few quotations from the text s  
hould make the essence of the doctrine c  
lear. X: 3  
: Here is the Mystery of Virtue. It createth all a

The Three Schools of M

114

Hoping that you are now recovered from the d  
evastating revelations in the matter of the Yellow School, I must a  
sk you to brace yourself for disclosures even more fo  
rmidable about the Black. Do not confuse with the Black Lodge, o  
r the Black Brothers

114

The Black School of Magick, which must by no means be   
confused with the School of Black Magick or Sorcery, w  
hich latter is a perversion of the White tradition, is dist  
inguished fundamentally from the Yellow School in that it c  
onsiders the Universe not as neutral, but as definitely a curse. I  
ts primary theorem is the 'First Noble Truth' of t  
he Buddha-"Everything is Sorrow." In the primitive classics of   
this School the idea of sorrow is confused with that of s  
in. (This idea of universal lamentation is presumably r  
esponsible for the choice of black as its symbolic colour. And yet? I  
s not white the Chinese hue of m  
ournin

114

The analysis of the philosophers of this School refers e  
very phenomenon to the category of sorrow. It is quite useless t  
o point out to them that certain events are accompanied with  
j oy: they continue their ruthless calculati9ns, and prove t  
o your satisfaction, or rather dissatisfaction, that the m  
ore apparently pleasant an event is, the more m  
alignantly deceptive is its fascination. There is only one way of e  
scap

115

7

115

even conceivable, and this way is quite simple, a  
nnihilation. (Shallow critics of Buddhism have wasted a great deal o  
f stupid ingenuity on trying to make out that Nirvana o  
r Nibbana means something different from what etymology,  
tradition, and the evidence of the Classics combine to define   
it. The word means, quite simply, c essation: and it stands to   
reason that, if everything is sorrow, the only thing which is  
not sorrow is nothing, and that therefore to escape fr  
om sorrow is the attainment of nothingne  
s

115

Western philosophy has on occasion approached t  
his doctrine. It has at least asserted that no known form of   
existence is exempt from sorrow. Huxley says, in h  
is Evolution and Ethics, "Suffering is the badge of all the t  
ribe of sentient things

115

The philosophers of this School, seeking, naturally e  
nough, to amend the evil at the root, inquire into the cause of t  
his existence which is sorrow, and arrive immediately at t  
he 'Second Noble Truth' of the Buddha: "The Cause of S  
orrow is Desire." They follow up with the endless concatenation o  
f causes, of which the final root is Ignorance. (I am n  
ot concerned to defend the logic of this School: I merely s  
tate their doctrine.) The practical issue of all this is that e  
very kind of action is both unavoidable and a crime. I must d  
igress to explain that the confusion of thought in this doctrine i  
s constantly recurrent. That is part of the blackness of t  
he Ignorance which they confess to be the foundation of t  
heir Universe. (And after all, everyone has surely the right to h  
ave his own Universe the way he wants i

115

This School being debased by nature , is not so far r  
emoved from conventional religion as either the White or the Y  
ellow. Most primitive fetishistic religions may, in fact, be c  
onsidered fairly faithful representatives of this philosophy. W  
here animism holds sway, the "medicine-man" personifies t  
his universal evil, and seeks to propitiate it by human sacri  
fice. The early forms of Judaism, and that type of C  
hristianity which we associate with the Salvation Army, Billy S  
unday and the Fundamentalists of the back-blocks of America, are

116

74

116

sufficiently simple cases of religion whose essence is t  
he propitiation of a malignant d  
emo

116

When the light of intelligence begins to dawn d  
imly through many fogs upon these savages, we reach a s  
econd stage. Bold spirits muster courage to assert that the evil w  
hich is so obvious, is, in some mysterious way, an illusion. T  
hey thus throw back the whole complexity of sorrow to a s  
ingle cause; that is, the arising of the illusion aforesaid. T  
he problem then assumes a final f orm: How is that illusion to b  
e destroyed.

116

A fairly pure example of the first stage of this type o  
f thought is to be found in the Vedas; of the second stage, i  
n the Upanishads. But the answer to the question, "How is t  
he illusion of evil to be destroyed?" depends on another p  
oint of theory. We may postulate a Parabrahm infinitely g  
ood, etc., etc., etc., in which case we consider the destruction o  
f the illusion of evil as the reuniting of the consciousness w  
ith Parabrahm. The unfortunate part of this scheme of things i  
s that on seeking to define Parabrahm for the purpose o  
f returning to Its p urity, it is discovered sooner or later, that I  
t possesses no qualities at all! In other words, as the far  
mer said, on being shown the elepha nt: There ain't no s  
ich animile. It was Gautama Buddha who perceived the i  
nutility of dragging in this imaginary pachyderm. Since our Parabra  
hm, he said to the Hindu philosophers, is actually nothing, w  
hy not stick to our original perception that everything is so  
rrow, and admit that the only way to escape from sorrow is t  
o arrive at n

116

We may complete the whole tradition of the Ind  
ian peninsula very simply. To the Vedas, the Upanishads, and t  
he Tripitaka of the Buddhists, we have only to add the T  
antras of what are called the Vamacharya Schools. Paradoxical as i  
t may sound the Tantrics are in reality· the most advanced o  
f the Hindus. Their theory is, in its philosophical ultimatum, a  
primitive stage of the White tradition, for the essence of t  
he Tantric cults is that by the performance of certain rites o  
f Magick, one does not only escape disaster, but obtains

117

7

117

positive benediction. The Tantric is not obsessed by t  
he will-to-die. It is a difficult business, no doubt, to get any fun   
out of existence ; but at least it is not impossible. In other   
words, he implicitly denies the fundamental proposition t  
hat existence is sorrow, and he formulates the essential p  
ostulate of the White School of Magick, that means exist by which t  
he universal sorrow (appar ent indeed to all o  
rdinary observation) may be unmasked, even as at the initiatory r  
ite of Isis in the ancient days of Khem. There, a N  
eophyte presenting his mouth, under compulsion, to the poutin  
g buttocks of the Goat of Mendez, found himself caressed b  
y the chaste lips of a virginal priestess of that Goddess at t  
he base of whose shrine is written that No man has lifted h

The basis of the Black philosophy is not impossibly m  
ere climate, with its resulting etiolation of the native, its l  
anguid, bilious, anaemic, fever-prostrated, emasculation of the soul o  
f man. We accordingly find few true equivalents of this S  
chool in Europe. In Greek philosophy there is no trace of any s  
uch doctrine. The poison in its foulest and most virulent fo  
rm only entered with Christianity .1 But even so, few men of a  
ny real eminence were found to take the axioms of pessimism  
seriously. Huxley, for all his harping on the minor key, w  
as an eupeptic Tory. The culmination of the Black philosophy i  
s only found in Schopenhauer, and we may regard him as  
having been obsessed, on the one hand, by the despair b  
orn of that false scepticism which he learnt from the b  
ankruptcy of Hume and Kant; on the other, by the direct obsession o  
f the Buddhist documents to which he was one of the e  
arliest Europeans to obtain access. He was, so to speak, driven t  
o suicide by his own vanity, a curious parallel to Kiriloff in The  
Possessed of Dostoevsky.

117

We have, however, examples plentiful enough of r

deriving almost exclusively from the Black tradition in t  
he different stages. We have already mentioned the E  
vangelical cults with their ferocious devil-god who creates mankind f  
or the pleasure of damning it and forcing it to crawl before h  
im, while he yells with drunken glee over the agony of his o  
nly son.2 But in the same class, we must place Christian S  
cience, so grotesquely afraid of pain, suffering, and evil of every sort,  
that its dupes can think of nothing better than to b  
leat denials of its actuality, in the hope of hypnotising thems  
elves into a

Practically no Westerns have reached the third stage of t  
he Black tradition, the Buddhist stage. It is only i  
solated mystics, and those men who rank themselves with a  
contemptuous compliance under the standard of the n  
earest religion, the one which will bother them least in their q  
uest of nothingness, who carry the sorites so far.

The documents of the Black School of Magick h  
ave already been indicated. They are, for the most part, t  
edious to the last degree and repulsive to every w  
holesome-minded m an; yet it can hardly be denied that such books as The  
Dhammapada and Ecclesiastes are masterpieces of l  
iterature. They represent the agony of human despair at its u  
tmost degree of intensi ty, and the melancholy contemplation w  
hich is induced by their perusal is not favourable to the i  
nception of that mood which should lead every truly courageo  
us intelligence to the determination to escape from the ferule o

his connection read carefully Browning's "Apollo and t

The Egyptian tradition of Osiris is not dissimilar. The   
central idea of the White School is that, admitted t  
hat "everything is sorrow" for the profane, the Initiate has t  
he means of transforming it to "everything is joy." There is n  
o question of any ostrich-ignoring of fact, as in Chris  
tian Science. There is not even any more or less s  
ophisticated argument about the point of view altering the situation as i  
n Vedantism. We have, on the contrary, an attitude which w  
as perhaps first of all, historically speaking, defined b  
y Zoroaster, "Nature teaches us, and the Oracles also a  
ffirm, that even the evil germs of Matter may alike become use  
ful and good. Stay not on the precipice with the dross of M  
atter; for there is a place for thine Image in a realm ever s

It appears that the Levant, from Byzantium and Athens t  
o Damascus, Jerusa lem, Ale xand ria, and Cairo, w  
as preoccupied with the formulation of this School in a popul  
ar religion, beginning in the days of Augustus Caesar. For t  
here are elements of this central idea in the works of the G  
nostics, in certain rituals of what Frazer conveniently calls the A  
siatic God, as in the remnants of the Ancient Egyptian cult. T  
he doctrine became abominably corrupted in committee, so t  
o speak, and the result was Christianity, which may be regar  
ded as a White ritual overlaid by a mountainous mass of B  
lack doctrine, like the baby of the mother that King S  
olomon non-suite

We may define the doctrine of the White School in i  
ts purity in very simple terms.   
Existence is pure joy. Sorrow is caused by failure t  
o perceive this f act; but this is not a misfortune. We h  
ave invented sorrow, which does not matter so much after all, i

120

78

120

order to have the exuberant satisfaction of getting rid of it.  
Existence is thus a sacr  
amen

120

Adepts of the White School regard their brethren of t  
he Black very much as the aristocratic English Sahib (of the d  
ays when England was a nation) regarded the benighted Hindu  
. Nietzsche expresses the philosophy of this School to t  
hat extent with considerable accuracy and vigour. The man w  
ho denounces life merely defines himself as the man who i  
s unequal to it. The brave man rejoices in giving and t  
aking hard knocks, and the brave man is joyous. The Scandinav  
ian idea of Valhalla may be primitive, but it is manly. A h  
eaven of popular concert, like the Christian; of unconscious repose,  
like the Buddhist; or even of sensual enjoyment, like t  
he Moslem, excites his nausea and contempt. He u  
nderstands that the only joy worth while is the joy of continual victory,   
and victory itself would become as tame as croquet if it w  
ere not spiced by equally continual d  
efea

120

The purest documents of the White School are found i  
n the Sacred Books of Thelema. The doctrine is given i  
n excellent perfection both in The Book of the Heart Girt w  
ith a Serpent and in the book of Lapis Lazuli. A single passage i  
s adequate to explain the fo  
rmula. 7. Moreover I beheld a vision of a river. There was a  
little boat thereon; and in it under purple sails was a   
golden woman, an image of Asi wrought in fine  
st gold. Also the river was of blood, and the boat o  
f shining steel. Then I loved her; and loosing m  
y girdle, cast myself into the s  
tream. 8. I gathered myself into the little boat, and for m  
any days and nights did I love her, burning beautiful  
incense before h

    s  
    tream. 13. Then at the end appointed her body was whiter t  
    han the milk of the stars, and her lips red and warm as  
    the sunset, and her life of a white heat like the h  
    eat of the midmost s  
    un. 14. Then rose she up from abyss of Ages of Sleep, a  
    nd her body embraced me. Altogether I melted in her  
    beauty and was g  
    lad. 15. The river also became the river of Amrit, and the   
    little boat was the chariot of the fles.h, and the s  
    ails thereof the blood of the heart that beareth me, t

We find even in profane literature this doctrine of the W  
hite School of Magick:  
Oh Buddha! couldst thou nowhere r  
est A pivot for the universe?  
Must all things be alike confe  
ssed Mere changes rung upon a curse?  
I swear by all the bliss of b  
lue My Phryne with her powder o

This loathly brooding on Decay;  
I call it Growth, and lov

ase. Poor pleasures, bitter bargains, these?  
I shall despise D  
iogenes. Follow your fancy far enough!  
At last you surely come to G  
o

122

There is thus in this School no attempt to deny that   
Nature is, as Zoroaster said, "a fatal and evil force"; b  
ut Nature i::, so to speak, "the First Matter of the Work," w  
hich is to be transmuted into gold. The joy is a function of o  
ur own part in this alchemy. For this reason we find the b  
oldest and most skilful adepts deliberately seeking out the m  
ost repugnant elements of Nature that their triumph may be the   
greater. The formula is evidently one of dauntless courage. I  
t expresses the idea of vitality and manhood in its m  
ost dynamic sense.

122

The only religion which corresponds to this School at all i  
s that of ancient Egypt; possibly also that of Chaldea. This i  
s because those religions are Magical religions in the s  
trict technical s ense; the religious component of them is negligib  
le. So far as it exists, it exists only for the uninitiat

122

There are, however, traces of the beginning of t  
he influence of the School in Judaism and in Paganism. T  
here are, too, certain documents of the pure Gr.eek spirit which   
bear traces of this. It is what they called Theurgy.

123

122

The Christian religion in its simplest essence, by that i  
dea of overcoming evil through a Magical ceremony, the

123

Crucifixion, seems at first sight a fair example of the W  
hite tradition ; but the idea of sin and of propitiation tainted i  
t abominably with Blackness. There have been, h  
owever, certain Christian thinkers who have taken the bold l  
ogical step of regarding evil as a device of God for exercising t  
he joys of combat and v ictory. This is, of course, a p  
erfectly White doctri ne; but it is regarded as the most dangerous o  
f heresies. (Romans V I: 1, 2, et al.

123

For all that, the idea is there. The Mass itself is essent  
ially a typical White ritual. Its purpose is to transform c  
rude matter directly into Godhead. It is thus a cardinal o  
peration of Talismanic Magick. But the influence of the Black S  
chool has corroded the idea with theological accretions  
, metaphysical on the one hand, and superstitious on t  
he other, so completely as to mask the Truth a  
ltogethe

123

At the Reformation, we find a nugatory attempt t  
o remove the Black element. The Protestant thinkers did t  
heir best to get rid of the idea of s in, but it was soon seen that t  
he effort could only lead to antinomianism; and they r  
ecognized that this would infallibly destroy the religious idea as s  
uc

123

Mysticism, both Catholic and Protestant, made a f  
urther attempt to free Christianity from the dark cloud of i  
niquity. They joined hands with the Sufis and the Vedantists. But t  
his again led to the mere denial of the reality of evil. T  
hus drawing away, little by little, from clear appreciation of t  
he facts of Nature, their doctrine became purely theoretical, a  
nd faded away, while the thundercloud of sin settled down m  
ore heavily than ever.

123

The most important of all the efforts of the White Schoo  
l, from an exoteric point of view, is Islam. In its doctrine t  
here is some slight taint, but much less than in Christianity. It is a  
virile religion. It looks facts in the face, and admits their   
horror; but it proposes to overcome them by sheer dint of   
manhood. Unfortunately, the metaphysical conceptions of i  
ts quasi-profane Schools are grossly materialistic. It is only the

124

82

124

Pantheism of the Sufis which eliminates the conception o  
f propitiation; and, in practice, the Sufis are too closely alli  
ed to the Vedantists to retain hold of reality.  
That will be all for the p

There is in history only one movement whose object h  
as been to organize the isolated adepts of the White School o  
f Magi.ck, and this movement was totally unconnected w  
ith religion, except in so far as it lent its influence to the   
reformers of the Christian church. Its appeal was not at all t  
o the people. It merely offered to open up relations with, and   
communicate certain practical secrets of wisdom to, i  
solated men of science throughout Europe. This movement i  
s generally known by the name of Rosicrucianism.

126

84

126

There is no good purpose, even were there license, t  
o discuss the nature of the basis of scientific attainment w  
hich is the core of the doctrines of the Society. It is o  
nly necessary to point out that its correspondence with a  
lchemy is the one genuine fact of the subject which has been allowed   
to transpire; for the Rosicrucian, as indicated by his c  
entral symbol, the barren cross on which he has made the rose t  
o flower, occupies himself primarily with spiritual a  
nd physiological alchemy. Talcing for "The First Matter of t  
he Work" a neutral or in�rt substance (it is constantly d  
escribed as the commonest and least valued thing on earth, and m  
ay actually connote any substance whatever) he d  
eliberately poisons it, so to speak, bringing it to a stage of tr  
ansmutation generally called the Black Dragon, and he proceeds to w  
ork upon this virulent poison until he obtains the perfe  
ction theoretically p

126

Incidentally, we have an almost precise parallel with t  
his operation in modern bacteriology. The apparently h  
armless bacilli of a disease are cultivated until they become a  
thousand times more virulent than at first, and it is from t  
his culture that is prepared the vaccine which is an e  
fficacious remedy for all the possible ravages of that kind o  
f m  
icro-o

126

We have been obliged to expose, perhaps at t  
oo considerable a length, the main doctrines of the t  
hree Schools. The task, however tedious, has been necessary in  
order to explain with reasonable lucidity their c  
onnection with the world which their ideas direct; that is to say, t  
he nature of their political a  
ctivitie

126

The Yellow School, in accordance with its doctrine o  
f perfectly elastic reaction and non-interference, holds i  
tself, generally speaking, entirely apart from all such questions. W  
e can hardly imagine it sufficiently interested in any events   
soever to react aggressively. It feels strong enough to d  
eal satisfactorily with anything that may turn u p; and g  
enerally speaking, it feels that any conceivable action on its part

127

8

127

would be likely to increase rather than to diminish t  
he m  
ischie

127

It remains somewhat contemptuously aloof from the   
eternal conflict of the Black School with the White. At t  
he same time, there is a certain feeling among the Yellow a  
depts that should either of these Schools become annihilated, t  
he result might well be that the victor would sooner or later tu  
m his released energy against t  
hemselve

127

In accordance, therefore, with their general plan o  
f non-action, as expressed in The Tao Teh King, of deal  
ing with mischief before it has become too strong to b  
e dangerous, they interfere gently from time to time to redress  
the b

127

During the last two generations the Masters of the Yell ow   
School have been compelled to take notice of the p  
rogressive ruin of the White adepts. Christianity, which possessed a  
t least the semblance of a White formula, is in the agonies o  
f decomposition, even before it is actually dead. M  
aterialistic science has overwhelmed the faith and hope of the Christi  
ans (they never possessed any charity to overwhelm) with a  
demonstration of the sorrow, transitoriness, and cruel f  
utility of the Universe. A vast wave of pessimism has engulfed t  
he fortress of Man's s

127

It was indeed a deadly blow to the adepts of the W  
hite School when Science, their own familiar friend in whom t  
hey trusted, lifted up his heel against them. It was in t  
his conjuncture that the Yellow adepts sent forth into t  
he Western world a messenger, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, w  
ith the distinct mission to destroy, on the one hand, the c  
rude schools of Christianity, and, on the other, to eradicate the   
materialism from Physical Science. She made the n  
ecessary connection with Edward Maitland and Anna Kingsford, w  
ho were trying rather helplessly to put the exoteric fonnulae o  
f the White School into the hands of students, and with t  
he secret representatives of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. It is   
not for us in this place to estimate the degree of success with

128

86

128

which she carried out her embassy; but at least we see t  
oday that Physical Science is at last penetrating to the s  
piritual basis of material phenomena. The work of Henry P  
oincare, Einstein, Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell is s  
ufficient evidence of this f

128

Christianity, too, has fallen into a lower degree o  
f contempt than ever. Realising that it was moribund, it m  
ade a supreme and suicidal effort, and plunged into t  
he death-spasm of the First World War. It was too far corrupt t  
o react to the injections of the White formula which might h  
ave saved it. We see today that Christianity is more bigo  
ted, further divorced from reality, than ever. In some countries i  
t has again become a persecuting c  
hurc

128

With horrid glee the adepts of the Black School looked o  
n at these atrocious paroxysms. But it did more. It m  
arshalled its forces quietly, and prepared to clean up the debris of t  
he battlefields. It is at present ( 1924 e.v.) pledged to a s  
upreme attempt to chase the manly races from their s  
piritual halidom. (The spasm still \[ 1945 e.v. \] continues; note w  
ell the pro-German screams of Anglican Bishops, and t  
he intrigues of the Vatican.

128

This, then, is the present state of the war of the Thr  
ee Schools. We cannot suppose that humanity is so entirely b  
ase as to accept Krishnamurti; yet that such a scheme could e  
ver have been conceived is a symptom of the almost hopeless  
decadence of the White School.1 The Black adepts b  
oas

129

8

129

openly that they have triumphed all along the line. T  
heir formula has attained the destruction of all positive q  
ualities. It is only one step to the stage when the annihilation of al  
l life and thought will appear as a fatal necessity. T  
he materialism and vital scepticism of the present time, its   
frenzied rush for pleasure in total disregard of any idea o  
f building for the future, testifies to a condition of c  
omplete moral disorder, of abject spiritual anarchy.

129

The White School has thus been paralysed. We a  
re reminded of the spider described by Fabre, who injects her   
victims with a poison which paralyzes them without k  
illing them, so that her own young may find fresh meat. And this is   
what is going to happen in Europe and America u  
nless something is done about it, and done in very short o

129

The Yellow School could not remain impassive s  
pectators of the abominations. Madame Blavatsky was a mer  
e forerunner. They, in conjunction with the Secret Chiefs of   
the White School in Europe, Chiefs who had been compelled   
to suspend all attempts at exoteric enlightenment by t  
he general moral debility which had overtaken the races fr  
om which they drew their adepts, have prepared a guide f  
or mankind. This man, of an extreme moral force and elevatio  
n, combined with a profound sense of worldly realities, h  
as stood forth in an attempt to save the White School, t  
o rehabilitate its formula, and to fling back from the b  
astions of moral freedom the howling savages of pessimism. U  
nless his appeal is heard, unless there comes a truly virile r  
eaction against the creeping atrophy which is poisoning them, u  
nless they enlist to the last man under his standard, a great d  
ecisive battle will have been l  
os

129

This prophet of the White School, chosen by its M  
asters and his brethren, to save the Theory and Practice, is arm  
ed with a sword far mightier than Excalibur. He has b  
een entrusted with a new Magical formula, one which can b  
e accepted by the whole human race. Its adoption w  
ill strengthen the Yellow School by giving a more positive v  
alue to their Theory; while leaving the postulates of the Black

130

88

130

School intact, it will transcend them and raise their T  
heory and Practice almost to the level of the Yell ow. As to t  
he White School, it will remove from them all taint of poison o  
f the Black, and restore vigour to their central formula o  
f spiritual alchemy by giving each man an independent ideal. I  
t will put an end to the moral castration involved in t  
he assumption that each man, whatever his nature, should d  
eny himself to follow out a fantastic and impracticable ideal o  
f goodness. Incidentally, this formula will save Physical S  
cience itself by making negligible the despair of futility, the v  
ital scepticism which has emasculated it in the past. It shows t  
hat the joy of existence is not in a goal, for that indeed is c  
learly unattainable, but in the going i  
tself. This law is called the Law of Thelema. It is summarised i  
n the four words, Do what thou w

It should not be necessary to explain that a ful  
l appreciation of this message is not to be obtained by a h  
asty examination. It is essential to study it from every point o  
f view, to analyse it with the keenest philosophical acu  
men, and finally to apply it as a key for every problem, i  
nternal and external, that exists. This key, applied with skill, will

From the deepest point of view, the greatest value of t  
his formula is that it affords, for the first time in history, a b  
asis of reconciliation between the three great Schools of M  
agick. It will tend to appease the eternal conflict by u  
nderstanding that each type of thought shall go on its own way, develop i  
ts own proper qualities without seeking to interfere with o  
ther formulae, however (superficially) opposed to its o

130

What is true for every School is equally true for e  
very individual. Success in life, on the basis of the Law o  
f Thelema, implies severe self-discipline. Each being m  
ust progress, as biology teaches, by strict adaptation to t  
he conditions of the organism. If, as the Black S  
chool continually asserts, the cause of sorrow is desire, we can s  
till escape the conclusion by the Law of Thelema. What is  
necessary is not to seek after some fantastic ideal, utterly

131

8

131

unsuited to our real needs, but to discover the true nature of   
those needs, to fulfil them, and rejoice therei

131

This process is what is really meant by initiation; that is t  
o say, the going into oneself, and making one's peace, so t  
o speak, with all the forces that one finds there.

131

It is forbidden here to discuss the nature of The Book o  
f the Law, the Sacred Scripture of Thelema. Even after f  
orty years of close expert examination, it remains to a gr  
eat extent mysterious; but the little we know of it is enough to   
show that it is a sublime synthesis of all Science and a  
ll ethics. It is by virtue of this Book that man may attain a  
degree of freedom hitherto never suspected to be possible, a  
spiritual development altogether beyond anything h  
itherto known; and, what is really more to the point, a control o  
f external nature which will make the boasted achievements of   
the last century appear no more than childish preliminaries t  
o an incomparably mighty m  
anhoo

131

It has been said by some that the Law of Thelema a  
ppeals only to the elite of humanity. No doubt there is this much in  
that assertion, that only the highest can take full a  
dvantage of the extraordinary opportunities which it offers. At t  
he same time, "the Law is for all." Each in his degree, every m  
an may learn to realise the nature of his own being, and t  
o develop it in freedom. It is by this means that the W  
hite School of Magick can justify its past, redeem its present, and   
assure its future, by guaranteeing to every human being a l

emphasizes the omnivalence of the force.) In the h  
igher degrees of O.T.0.-the A :. A:. is not fond of terms like t  
his, which verge on the picturesque-it is usually called "  
the Ophidian Vibrations," thus laying special stress upon i  
ts serpentine strength, subtlety, its control of life and d

It is of this universally powerful weapon that the S  
ecret Chiefs must be supposed to possess complete c  
ontrol. They can induce a girl to embroider a tapestry, or initiate a

political movement to culminate in a world-war; all in purs  
uit of some plan wholly beyond the purview or t  
he comprehension of the deepest and subtlest thinkers.

135

(It should go without saying that the adroit use of t  
hese vibrations enables one to perform all the classical 'miracles'  
.) These powers are stupendous. These powers move i  
n dimensions of time and space quite other than those w  
ith which we are familiar. Their values are incomprehensible to   
us. To a Secret Chief, wielding this weapon, "The nice   
conduct of a clouded cane" might be infinitely m  
ore important than a war, famine and pestilence such as m

ay equally be levelled at Captain A, and Admiral B, of the N  
aval Intelligence Department. These "Secret Chiefs" keep in t

One asset in the Audit of a fact is the amount o  
f knowledge which it covers. (2 + 5)2 = 49; (3 + 4)2 = 49;  
(6 + 2)2 = 64; (7 + 1)2 = 64; (9 + 4)2 = 169 are isolated fa  
cts, no more; worse, the coincidences of 49 and 64 might s  
tart the wildest phantasies in your head-"something m  
ysterious about this." But if you write: the sum of the squares of a  
ny two numbers is the sum of the square of each plus twice t  
heir multiple-(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b 2-you have got a fact w  
hich covers every possible case, and exhibits one aspect of t  
he nature of numbers themselves. The importance of a w  
ord increases as its rank, from the particular and concrete to the   
general and abstract. (It is curious that the highest values o  
f all, the "Laws of Nature," are never exactly 'true' for a

al phenomena sensible to another, since two people cannot b

From one point of view (bless your heart!) you are n  
othing at all but a bundle of memories. When you say "this i

When I say "I see a horse," the truth is that "I record in

Well, then! You realize, of course, how many millions o  
r billions of memories there must be to compose any a  
verage well-trained mind. Those strings of adjectives all s

See to it, then, that you accept no worthless material; t

146

Well, now, before going further into this, I must b  
ehave like an utter cad, and disgrace my family tree, and blot m  
y 'scutcheon and my copybook by confusing you a  
bout "realism." Excuse: not my muddle; it was made centuries a  
go by a gang of cursed monks, headed by one D  
uns Scotus-sQ-Called because he was Irish-or if not b  
y somebody else equally objectionable. They held to t  
he Platonic dogma of archetypes. They maintained that t  
here was an original (divine) idea such as "greenness" or a "  
pig," and that a green pig, as observed in nature, was just o  
ne example of these two ideal essences. They were opposed b  
y the "nominalists," who said, to the contrary, t  
hat "greenness" or "a pig" were nothing in themselves; they w  
ere mere names (nominalism from Lat. nomen, a name) i  
nvented for convenience of grouping. This doctrine is p  
lain commonsense, and I shall waste no time in demolishing t  
he r  
ealists. All a priori thinking, the worst kind of thinking, goes with   
"realism" in this sense.

147

105

147

I think you already understand the main point: you m  
ust structuralise your thinking. You must learn how t  
o differentiate and how to integrate your thoughts. N  
othing exists in isolation: it is always conditioned by its relations w  
ith other things; indeed, in one sense, a thing is no more than the   
sum of these relations. (For the only "reality," in the l  
ong run, is, as we have seen, a Point of Vie

When, in one of those curious fits of indisposition o

f Tiphareth-Oh! the fonn of Leo, probably in the Q  
ueen Scale" and thereby increase your vocabulary by these t  
wo items. Then, perhaps, someone suggests that indiscretion i  
n the worship of Dionysus is responsible for the o  
bserved phenomena-well, there's Tiphareth again at once; the P  
riest, moreover, wears a leopard-skin, and the spots suggest t  
he Sun. Also, Sol is Lord of Leo: so there you are! pink l

It is not unlike the system of keys used in b

f which opens one door, and one door only. Then, a set w  
hich opens all the doors on one floor only. And so on, until t  
he one responsible who has one unique key which opens e  
very lock in the b

148

There is another point about this whole System of t  
he Qabalah. It does more than merely increase the m  
nemonic faculty by 10,000 percent or so; the habit of throwing y  
our thoughts about, manipulating them, giving them a wash a  
nd brush-up, packing them away into their proper places in y  
our "Crystal Cabinet," gives you immensely increased power o  
ver t

148

In particular, it helps you to rid them of the emotional d  
irt which normally clogs them;2 you become p  
erfectly indifferent to any implication but their value in respect o  
f the whole system; and this is of incalculable help in t  
h

149

107

149

acquisition of new ideas. It is the difference between a m  
an trying to pick a smut out of his wife's eye with clumsy gr  
easy fingers coarsened by digging drains, and an oculist f u  
mished with a speculum and all the instruments exactly suited to t  
he t

149

Yet another point. Besides getting rid of the emotions a  
nd sensations which cloud the thought, the fact that you a  
re constantly asking yourself "Now, in which drawer of w  
hich cabinet does this thought go?" automatically induces you t  
o regard the system as the important factor in the operation, i  
f only because it is common to every one of the

149

So not only have you freed Sanna (perception) from t  
he taint of Vedana (sensation) but raised it (or demolished it, i  
f you prefer to look at it in that light!) to be merely a m  
ember of the Sankhara (tendency) class, thus boosting y  
ou vigorously to the fourth stage, the last before the last! of the   
practice of Mahasatipa

149

Just one more word about the element of Vedana. T  
he Intellect is a purely mechanical contrivance, as accurate a  
nd as careless of what it turns out as a Cash Register. It r  
eceives impressions, calculates, states the result: that is A double L,   
A  
LL! Try never to qualify a thought in any way, to see it as it i  
s in itself in relation to those other elements which are   
necessary to make it what it i  
s. Above all, do not "mix the planes." A dagger may be s  
harp or blunt, straight or crooked; it is not "wicked-looking," o  
r even "trusty," except in so far as the quality of its s  
teel makes it so. A cliff is not "frowning" or "menacing." A  
snow-covered glacier is not "treacherous": to say so m  
eans only that Alpine Clubmen and other persons ignorant o  
f mountain craft are unable to detect the position of c  
overed crevasses  
. All such points you must decide for yourself; t  
he important thing is that you should challenge any such i  
deas. Above all, do not avoid, or slur, unwelcome trains of

What happens when the Aspirant invokes Diana, or calls u  
p Lilith? He increases the sum of his experiences in t  
hese particular ways. Sometimes he has a 'liaison-experien  
ce', which links two main lines of thought, and so is w  
orth dozens of isolated gai  
ns. Now, if there is any difference at all between the W  
hite and the Black Adept in similar case, it is that the one,   
working by "love under will" achieves a marriage with t  
he new idea, while the other, merely grabbing, adds a c  
oncubine to his harem of slaves

152

The about-to-be-Black Brother constantly restricts h  
imself; he is satisfied with a very limited ideal; he is afraid of l  
osing his individuality-reminds one of that "Nordic" t  
waddle about "race-pollut

But then (you ask) how can a man go so far wrong after h

rother deserts his Angel when he realises the Progra  
mme. Perhaps his error was so deeply rooted, from the very   
beginning, that it was his Evil Genius that he evoked  
. In such cases the man's policy is of course to break off al  
l relations with the Supernal Triad, and to replace it b  
y inventing a false crown, Daath. To them Knowledge will be

3. The Magical side. Sex is, directly or indirectly, t  
   he most powerful weapon in the annoury of the Magic  
   ian; and precisely because there is no moral guide, it is   
   indescribably dangerous. I have given a great m  
   any hints, especially in Magick, and The Book o  
   f Thoth-some of the cards are ahnost blatantly revealin  
   g; so I have been rapped rather severely over the k  
   nuckles for giving children matches for playthings. My e  
   xcuse has been that they have already got the matches, t  
   hat my explanations have been directed to add c  
   onscious precautions to the existing automatic safeguard

171

The above remarks refer mainly to the technique of t  
he business; and it is going a very long way to tell you that y  
ou ought to be able to work out the principles thereof fr  
om your general knowledge of Magi.ck, but especially t  
he Formula of Tetragrammaton, clearly stated and explained i  
n Magick, Chapter III. Combine this with the heart of C  
hapter XII and you've got i

171

But there is another point at issue. This incidentally, i  
s where the "automatic safeguards" come in. "Thou hast no   
right but to do thy will" (AL, I: 42) means that to "go   
awhoring after strange" purposes can only be disastrous. It i  
s possible, in chemistry, to provoke an endothermic reaction;  
but that is only asking for trouble. The product bears w  
ithin its own heart the seed of dissolution. Accordingly, the m  
ost important preliminary to any Magical operation is to m  
ake sure that its object is not only harmonious with, b  
ut necessary to, your Great Work.

171

Note also that the use of this supreme method involves t  
he manipulation of energies ineffably secret and most d  
elicately sensitive; it compares with the operations of ordinary M  
agi.ck as the last word in artillery does with the b  
lunderbus

171

What is the damn thing, anyway

172

130

172

That's just the trouble; for it is the first of the masks u  
pon the face of the True Will; and that mask is the P  
oke

172

As all true Art is spontaneous, is genius, is utterly b  
eyond all conscious knowledge or control, so also is sex. Indeed, o  
ne might class it as deeper still than Art; for Art does at l  
east endeavour to find an intelligible means of expression. That i  
s much nearer to sanity than the blind lust of the s  
ex-impulse. The maddest genius does look from Chokmah not only t  
o Binah, but to the fruit of that union in Daath and the R  
uach; the sex-impulse has no use for Binah to understand, t  
o interpret, to transmit. It wants no more than an in  
strument which will destroy i

172

What then is the magical remedy? Obvious enough to t  
he Qabalist. "Love is the law, love under will." It must be fit  
ted at its earliest manifestations with its proper Binah, so as t  
o flow freely along the Path of Daleth, and restore the l  
ost Balance. Attempts to suppress it are fatal, to sublime it ar  
e false and futile. But, guided wisely from the start, by t  
he time it becomes strong it has learnt how to use its virtues t  
o the best advantage.

The word of Sin is Restriction. 0 man! refuse not t  
hy wife, if she will; 0 lover, if thou wilt, depart! There i  
s no bond that can unite the divided but love; all else is a  
curse. Accurse'ci! Accurse'd be it to the a  
eons! Consent or refusal are to be determined by the i  
mpulse itself, without reference to any other motives such a  
s commonly influence a

173

So with thy all; thou hast no right but to do thy W  
ill. Every thought, word, or act without exception i  
s subject to this law. "Do what thou wilt" does not g  
ive license to do anything else; lest this be not understo  
od, the doctrine is here explicit: "Thou hast no right but t  
o do thy will. '  
' Every particle of energy must be built into this s  
ingle-track machine of will; directly or indirectly, it must serve the o  
ne purpose. A very small hole in the hull may sink a very l  
arge ship.  
Every act, therefore, with the thoughts and words which   
determine its performance, is a sacrament

174

132

174

Now of all acts the most intrinsicaUy important is the a  
ct of love. Firstly, because the ecstasy which accompanies i  
ts due performance is a physical image, or hint, of the state o  
f Samadhi, since the consciousness of the Ego is temporarily in   
abeyance; secondly, because its normal effect on the m  
aterial plane is, or may be, incalculably vast. (The emphasis on t  
he word "due" is absolute.) Precisely because it is so powerful a  
weapon, its use is hedged in with manifold precautions, a  
nd its abuse deprecated in injunctions heavily charged w  
ith menace .... "Also, take your ftll and will of love as ye w  
ill, when, where and with whom ye will! But always unto M

174

If this be not aright; if ye confound the spa  
ce-marks, saying: They are one; or saying, They are many; if t  
he ritual be not ever unto me; then expect the direful  
judgments of Ra Boor Khu

nd spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed t  
he nations of the earth in splendour & pride; but a  
lways in the love of me, and so shall ye come to my joy.  
There is a veil, that veil is black. It is th(' veil of t  
he modest woman; it is the veil of sorrow, & the pall o  
f death: this is none of me. Tear down that lying spectr  
e of the centuries: veil not your vices in virtuous w  
ords: these vices are my service; ye do well, & I will r  
eward you here and hereafter.   
There is help and hope in other spells. Wisdom sa  
ys: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be n  
ot animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the  
eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed b  
y delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there b

Here is confirmation in detail of AL, I: 41. This act is a  
definite electrical or magnetic phenomenon. No o  
ther considerations apply. (It will therefore occasionally seem, t  
o the outsider, unreasonable.) The only exception-it is o  
nly apparently so-is when satisfaction of the impulse w  
ould manifestly thwart the True Will more than it would help t  
o fulfil i t; any such case must be judged on its m  
erit

175

"But always unto Me." The word "always" admits of n  
o exception; "unto Me" may be paraphrased as the "fulfilmen  
t of one possibility necessary to the achievement of the G  
reat Work." Every act is a sacrament, but this pre-eminently s  
o. The text continues with a plain threat: "if the ritual be not   
ever unto Me, then expect the direful judgments of Ra H  
oor Khuit." To profane this sacrament of sacraments is the m  
ost fatal of errors and offences; for it is high treason to the G  
reat Work itself.

175

The next verse repeats: "If the ritual be not ever u  
nto me"; and it is emphasized and fortified with a threat. T  
he offender is no longer in free enjoyment of the caresses of t  
he Goddess of Love; he is cast out into the penal constraint o  
f the merciless and terrible God of Chapter 1

175

" ... Be goodly t herefore; dress ye an in fine apparel; e  
at rich foods and drink sweet wines and wines that foam! A  
lso, take your fill and will of love as ye will ... " This refers t  
o the technique of the art; it will be explained later in t  
his essa  
y. "With whom ye will." This repeats what has been s  
aid already above in the notes to AL, I: 4

But exceed! e

Genius without technique is often clumsy and   
unintelligible; but technique without genius is dry bones.   
Genius is there, or is not there; nor wit nor work avail if it be  
absent. Yet one may maintain that it is always there, since   
"Every man and every woman is a star." In any case o  
nly technique responds to study and exercise; it has been wr  
itten that it "demands as much study as theology, and as m

ization (horrlbilesque ultimosque Brittanos) and their colonies, p

o-?" 4. Atmospherics-e.g. voices apparently from some   
alien s  
ource. 5. Aberrations of the control itself; and the result itself.  
(Remember the practice of some Hindu schools: "  
Not that, not that!" to whatever it is that presents itself a  
s Tat Sat-reality, t  
ruth.) Need I remind you how urgent the wish to escape w  
ill assuredly become, how fantastic are the mind's devices a  
nd excuses, amounting often to deliberate revolt? In Kandy I  
broke away in a fury, and dashed down to Colombo with t  
he intention of painting the very air as red as the betel-spittle on   
the pavements! But after three days of futile search for   
satisfying debauchery I came back to my horses, and, s  
ure enough, it was merely that I had gone stale; the r  
elaxation soothed and steadied me; I resumed the discipline w

I mention this because it is the normal habit of the m  
ind to organize these counter-attacks that makes their task so   
easy. What you need is a mind that will help rather than   
hinder your Work by its normal fu  
nction. This is where these Greetings, and Will-sayings, a

It is not a concentration-practice proper; I haven't a g  
ood word for it. " Ba ckground-concentration" o  
r "long-distance-concentration" are clumsy, and not t  
oo accurate. It is really rather like a public school e  
ducation. One is not constantly "doing a better thing than one has e  
ver done"; one is not dropping one's eye-glass every two m  
inutes, or being a little gentleman in the act of brushing one's h  
air. The point is that one trains oneself to react properly at a  
ny moment of surprise. It must become "second nature" for

"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" to s  
pring to the forefront of the mind when one is introduced to a  
stranger, or comes down to breakfast, or hears the t  
elephone bell, or observes the hour of the adoration, (these are to b  
e the superficial reactions, like instinctively rising when a l  
ady enters the room) or, at the other end, in moments o  
f immediate peril, or of sudden apprehension, or when in o

One need not be dogmatic about the use of these s  
pecial words. One might choose a forrnuia to represent one's o  
wn particular True Will. It is a little like Cato (or Scipio, was i  
t?) who concluded every speech, whether about the R  
egulations of the Roman Bath or the proposal to reclaim a marsh of t

9 The Act of T  
rut

194

152

194

Analysed, it is to make the assumption that s  
omething which seems very wrong is actually all right, that an e  
ager wish is an accomplished fact, a reasonable anxiety, enti  
rely unfounded-and to act accordingly

194

For instance, I'm in some desolate place, dependent fo  
r my food supply on a weekly messenger. If he is a day late, i  
t is awkward; if two, it means hardship; if three, serious r  
isk. One is naturally anxious as the day approaches; perhaps t  
he weather, or some similar snag, makes it likely that he will be   
late. From one cause or another, I have rather exceeded m  
y ration. There is nothing I can do about it, m  
aterially. The sensible course of action is to draw in my horns, live   
on the minimum necessary to life, which involves cutting t  
he da y's work down to almost nothing, and hope for the b  
est, expecting the w

194

But there is a Magical mode of procedure. You say

to

195

195

yourself: I am here to do this Work in accordance with m  
y true Will. The Gods have got to see to it that I'm not b  
aulked by any blinking messenger. (But take care They d  
on't overhear you; They might mistake it for Hybris, o  
r presumption. Do it all in the Sign of Silence, under the a  
egis of Harpocrates, the "Lord of Defence and Protection"; b  
e careful to assume his God-form, as standing on t  
wo crocodiles.) Then you increase your consumption, and at t  
he same time put in a whole lot of extra Work. If you p  
erform this "Act of Truth" properly , with genuine conviction t  
hat nothing can go wrong, your messenger will arrive a day e  
arly, and bring an extra large supply.

195

This, let me say at once, is very difficult, especially at fir  
st, until one has gained confidence in the. efficacy of the   
Formula; and it is very nastily easy to "fake." Going t  
hrough the motions (as they say) is more futile here than in m  
ost cases, and the results of messing it up are c  
ommonly disastrous

195

You must invent your act to suit your case, every time;  
suppose you expect a cable next Friday week, transfe  
rring cash to your account. You need $500 to make up a  
n important payment, and you don't know whether they w  
ill send even $200. What are you going to do about it? S  
kimp, and save your expenses, and make yourself miserable a  
nd incapable of vigorous thought or action? You may succeed i  
n saving enough to swing the deal; but you won't get a p  
enny beyond the amount actually needed-and look at the cost i  
n moral grandeur!   
No, go and stand yourself a champagne luncheon, a  
nd stroll up Bond Street with an 8Yl "Hoye de Monterey," and   
squander $30 on some utterly useless bauble. Then the $  
500 will swell to $ 1000, and arrive two days early at t

1. Do not be misled by any apparent superficial resemblance to "  
   Christian Science" and "Coueism" and their cackling kin. They miss every essential fea  
   ture of the formula

195

There are one or two points to consider very c  
arefully indeed before you start:

196

154

196

1. The proposed Act must be absurd; it won't do at a  
   ll if by some fluke, however unlikely, it might accompli  
   sh your aiµi. For instance, it's no use backing an outs  
   ider. There must be no causal l  
   in

196

2. The Act must be one which makes the situation   
   definitely worse. E .g.: suppose you are counting on a  
   new dress to make a hit at a Reception, and d  
   oubt whether it is so much better than your present best, o  
   r whether it will be finished in time. Then, wear t  
   hat present best to-night (wet, of course) knowing you are  
   sure to soil i

196

3. Obviously, all the usual conditions of a M  
   agical Operation apply in this as in all cases; your aim m  
   ust conform with your True Will, and all that; but there i  
   s one curious point about an Act of Truth: this, that o  
   ne should resort to it only when there is no other meth  
   od possible. In the explorer's case, above, it won't do if h  
   e has any means of hurrying up the m

the Lamen. N  
ow what are these things when they are at home? That's easy   
e  
nough. The Lam en is a sort of Coat of Arms. It expresses the   
character and powers of the wearer

197

A talisman is a storehouse of some particular kind o  
f energy, the kind that is needed to accomplish the task fo  
r which you have constructed i

197

The Pantacle is often confused with both the o  
thers; accurately, it is a Minutum Mundum, "the Universe i  
n Little"; it is a map of all that exists, arranged in the Order o  
f Nature. There is a chapter in Book 4, Part II, devoted to i  
t (pp. 1 17- 129); I cannot make up my mind whether I like i

198

156

198

At the best it is very far from being practical instruc  
tion. (The chapter on the Lamen, pp. 159-1 61, is even worse.  
) An analogy, not too silly, for these three: the C  
hess-player, the Opening, and the Game i

198

But-you will object-why be silly at all? Why not sa  
y simply that the Lamen, stating as it does the Character and   
Powers of the wearer, is a dynamic portrait of the individ  
ual, while the Pantacle, his Universe, is a static portrait of him?  
and that, you pursue flatteringly, is why you preferred t  
o call the Weapon of Earth (in the Tarot) the Disk, emphasi  
zing its continual whirling movement rather than the Pantacle o  
r Coin, as is more usual. Once again, exquisite child of o  
ur Father the Archer of Light and of seaborn Aphrodite, y  
our well-known acumen has "nicked the ninety and nine and o  
ne over" as Browning says when he (he too!) alludes to t  
he Taro

198

As you will have gathered from the above, a Talisman is a   
much more restricted idea; it is no more than one of the   
objects in his Pantacle, one of the arrows in the quiver of h  
is Lamen. As, then, you would expect, it is very little trouble t  
o design. All that you need is to "make considerations" a  
bout your proposed operation, decide which planet, sign, e  
lement or sub-element or what not you need to accomplish y  
our miracle.

198

As you know, a very great many desirable objects can b  
e attained by the use of the talismans in The Greater a  
nd Lesser Keys of Solomon the King; also in Pietro Di Abano   
and the dubious Fourth Book of Cornelius Agripp

198

You must on no account attempt to use the squares gi  
ven in The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage u  
ntil you have succeeded in the Operation. More, unless you mean   
to perform it, and are prepared to go to any length to do s  
o, you are a fool to have the book in your possession at all.  
Those squares are liable to get loose and do things on t  
heir own initiative; and you won't like i

Then there are the Elemental Tablets of Sir Edward K

o perform almost any conceivable operation, if you unde  
rstand the virtue of the various symbols which they manifest. T  
hey are actually an expansion of the Tarot. (Obviously, the Tarot  
itself as a whole is an universal Pantacle-forgive t  
he pleonasm! Each card, especially is this true of the Trumps, i  
s a talisman; and the whole may also be considered as t  
he Lam en of Mercury. It is evidently an Idea far too vast for a  
ny human mind to comprehend in its entirety. For it is "

199

The decisive advantage of this system is not that its v  
ariety makes it so adaptable to our needs, but that we a  
lready possess the Invocations necessary to call forth the E  
nergies required. What is perhaps still more to the point, they w  
ork without putting the Magician to such severe toil and e  
xertion as is needed when he has to write them out from his o  
wn ingenium. Yes! This is weakness on my part, and I am v  
ery naughty to encourage you to shirk the hardest p

I used often to make the background of my Talismans o  
f four concentric circles, painting them, the first (inmost) i  
n the King (or Knight) scale, the second in the Queen, the t  
hird in the Prince, and the outermost in the Princess scale, of the   
Sign, Planet, or Element to which I was devoting it. On t  
his, preferably in the "flashing" colours, I would paint t  
he appropriate Names and F

and inscribed with a suitable "versicle" chosen from sone Holy   
Book, or devised by the Magician to suit the c

You must lay most closely to your heart the theory of t  
he Magical Link (see Magick, pp. l 07- 122) and see well to it t  
hat it rings true; for without this your talisman is worse than   
useless. It is dangerous; for all that Energy is bound t  
o expend itself somehow; it will make its own links with  
anything handy that takes its fancy; and you can get into any   
sort of the most serious kind of t  
roubl

There is a great deal of useful stuff in Magick, pp. 92-1 0

he Talisman, of how to evoke or to invoke the Bei

May I close with a stray example or so? The Equinox, V

Occasionally, when I began, I set up the "

t never seemed to help enough to compensate for t  
he distraction caused by the complication. What I do observe t  
o examine the situation of to-day is Transits. These I h  
ave found very reliable; but even with these I usually i  
gnore aspects of minor importance. Truth to tell, conj  
unctions mean very much more than the rest put t  
ogethe

There are a few completely quack systems, such as t  
hose which mix up the science with Toshosophical hypo  
theses; naturally you discard these. But even of generaJly accept  
able forms of Astrology, such as Mundane and Horary, I tend t  
o be distrustful. I ask, for instance, why, if Taurus rules P  
oland and Ireland, as is no doubt the case, the crash and m  
assacres of 1939 e.v. and later in the one did not take place in t  
he other. All the seaports of the world naturally come under o  
ne of the three watery signs; but we do not find that an  
affliction of Pisces, which hits Tunis, should do no harm t  
o all the other harbours similarly ru  
le

203

This brings us to the first Big Jump in the steeplechase o  
f the whole science. We hear of thousands of people be  
ing killed at the same time (within an hour or two, perhaps a   
minute or two) by earthquake, shipwreck, explosion, b  
attle or other form of violence. Was the horoscope of every one o  
f the victims marked with the probability of some such end? I  
have known very strange cases of coincidence, but not to t  
hat e

203

The answer, I believe, is manifold. It might be, f  
or example, that Poland and Ireland are ruled by differ  
ent degrees of Taurus; that there are major and minor figures, t  
he former overruling the latter, so that the figure of t  
he launching of the ''Titanic" swallowed up the nativities of t  
he victims of her wre

Something of this sort is really an obvious truth. Flood i  
n China, famine in India, pestilence anywhere, e  
vidently depend on maps of a scale far more enormous than t

Then-on this point I fee) reasonably sure-there may be

one or more factors of which we know nothing at all, b  
y which the basic possibilities of a figure are set to work. (  
Just as a car with engine running will not start until the clutch is

204

I will conclude by announcing a rather r  
emarkable p  
osition. 1. I see no objection at all to postulating that c  
ertain "rays," or other means of transmitting some peculi  
ar form or forms of energy, may reach us from the o  
ther parts of the solar system; for we can in fact point t  
o perfectly analogous phenomena in the discoveries of t  
he last hundred years or so. But that is no more than a  
pos  
tulate. 2. The objections to Astrology as such, indicated b  
y what I have already pointed out, and several o  
thers, would suffice to place me among the most a  
rrogant disbelievers in the whole study, were it not for w  
hat fo  
llows. 3. The facts with regard to the Ascendant are so p  
atent, so undeniable, and so inexplicable without the pos  
tulate in ( 1 ) , that I am utterly convinced of the f  
undamental truth of the basic principles of the s

First, you must know y  
our correspondences by heart backwards and upside down (  
air connu). They are practically all in The Book of Thoth ; b  
ut "if anyone anything lacks," look for it in 777.

205

Then, get a book on Astrology, the older the b  
etter. Raphael's Shilling Handbook is probably enough for t  
he present purpose. Get well into your head what the menu s  
ays about the natures of the planets, the influence of the a  
spects, what is meant by dignities, the scope of the houses, and s  
o o

205

Dovetail all this with your classical knowled ge; t  
he character and qualities, the powers and the exploits, of t  
he several deities c  
oncerne

205

Next, learn how to set up a figure of the heavens. T  
his need not take an average intelligent person more than a  
n hour at the most. You can learn it from a book. Lastly, g  
et Bailey's 1001 Notable Nativities and More Nativities. A  
lso any other collections available. Practice setting up t  
he horoscopes. Use the Chaldean square system; it shows at the   
first glance what is happening in the angular houses, w  
hich are the keys of the whole figure.

205

Compare and contrast what you know of the natives, fr  
om history, with what is said of the aspects (and the rest) in t  
he books you have read.

206

164

206

Put together similar horoscopes; e.g. a dozen which h  
ave Sagittarius rising, another lot with Jupiter in the mid-heav  
en, and so on; see if you can find a similarity in their lives with   
what the books will have led you to expect.

206

Don't be afraid to criticise; on the contrary, do s  
ome research work on your own, and find cases which seem t  
o contradict trad  
ition. I nstance: Saturn in the M.C. is said to cause a s  
pectacular rise in a man's career, ending in an equally notable c  
rash. Examples: Napoleon I and Ill, Oscar Wilde, Woodrow W  
ilson, Lord Northcliffe, Hitler. Look for figures with Saturn t  
hus placed, whose natives have jogged along equably and died i  
n the odour of sanctity. Find out why what worked in some   
cases failed in o

206

By the time you have studied (say) 500 nativities you w  
ill be already a fairly competent judge. Work your bloody g  
uns! as Kipling says; get a friend-just this once I allow you h  
uman i nt ercourse-to set up for you figures of h  
istorical importance, or with some outstanding characteristic (  
e.g. murderers, champions of sport, statesmen, m  
onsters, philanthropists, heresiarchs) without telling you to whom i

Sometimes, even now, you may assign the figure of t  
he Archbishop of York to Jabez Balfour or Catherine de M  
edici; or mix up Moody and Sankey with Brown and Kenned  
y: don't be discouraged; perhaps there may be something to b  
e said for you after a  
ll! I believe, as I hope, that you will be surprised at the s  
peed with which you acquire proficien

206

All this time, moreover, you have not been wholly i  
dle. You will have been running about like a demented rabbit

207

165

207

and trying to spot the rising sign of everybody you k  
now. Look at them full-face, then profile; and note s  
alient characteristics, pendulous lips, receding chins, bulbous noses,   
narrow foreheads, stuck-out ears, pimples, squints, w  
arts, shape of face (three main types ; thin, jutting, for c  
ardinal signs; square, steadfast for kerubic; weak, nondescript, f  
or the rest); then the stature, whether lithe, well-knit, sturd  
y, muscular, fat or what not; in short every bodily feature i  
n tum; make up your mind what sign was rising at birth, a  
nd stick to it!

207

Again, you can practice this in cafes, when you v  
isit civilized countries, and it is often possible to s  
crape acquaintance with people who look specially interesting, a  
nd do not, as in England, instantly suspect you of d  
ishonourable advances, and get them to play up. This is sometimes e  
asier when you are already with that friend which I was so lax a  
s to allow you; and it is, I own, very helpful to discuss s  
trange faces if only to make it quite clear to your own mind w  
hy you decide on one as Virgo, another as T  
auru

207

When you have got your sea-legs at both these parts o  
f your astrological education, you may (I think) put out to sea   
with some confidence. Perhaps a fair test of your f  
itness would be when you got three people right out of four, in a  
total of a score or so. Well, allow for my being in a "  
mood" to-night; call it two out of three. If it were guesswork, a

But if circumstances deny you for the moment the m

you can certainly do your best to create a f  
airly satisfactory-above all, workable-substitute.

209

In Mexico, D.F. for instance, I took m  
y bedroom itself for the Circle, my night table for the Altar, my   
candle for the Lamp; and I made the Weapons compact. I had   
a Wand eight inches long, all precious stones and enamel, t  
o represent the Tree of Life; within, an iron tube c  
ontaining quicksilver-very correct, lordly, and damsilly. What a c

sachet of rose-petals in yellow silk, and another in green s

ost efficacious to make a Circle, and build an altar, of stones; m  
y Alpine lantern served admirably for the Lamp. It did d  
ouble duty when required: e.g. in partaking of the Sacrament of t  
he Four Elements, it served for Fire. But your conditions are  
not so restricted as t

210

Let us consider what one can do with an ordinary h  
ouse, such as you are happy enough to p  
ossess. First of all, it is of immense advantage to have a r  
oom specially consecrated to the Work, never used for any o  
ther purpose, and never entered by any other person t  
han yourself, unless it were another Initiate, either for inspection   
or in case you were working toget  
her. The aura accumulates with the regularity and frequency o  
f U

210

The first point is the Banishing: Everything is to b  
e removed from the room which is not absolutely necessary t  
o the W  
ork. In this country, one must attend to the heating. A  
n electric stove in the East or the South, is best: it must n  
ot need attention. One can usually buy stoves with e  
xcellent appropriate symbolism. (Last time I did this-13 e.v.-I got a  
perfect Ferranti at Harrods. The circular copper bowl, with   
the central Disk as the source of heat, is unsurpassable.) T  
he walls should be "self-coloured," a neutral tint-green, grey o  
r blue-grey?-and entirely bare, unless you put up, in the   
proper quarters, the proper designs, such as the "  
Watch Towers"-see The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 7

210

Remember that your "East," your Kiblah, is Bole  
skine House, which is as near as possible due North fr  
om Plymouth. Find North by the shadow of a vertical rod at   
noon, or by the Pole-Star. Work out the angle as u  
sual. The Stele of Revealing may be just on the North Wall t  
o make your "

210

Next, your Circle. The floor ought to be "Earth" green

211

169

211

but white will serve, or black. (A Masonic carpet is not at a  
ll bad.) The Circle itself should be as shown in Book 4, Part I

211

This should then be painted in the correct colours on t  
he floor: the Kether square to the North, your "East."

211

The Altar must fit exactly the square of Tiphareth; it i  
s best made as a cupboard; of oak or acacia, by preference. I  
t can then be used to hold reserves of incense and o  
ther r

211

Note that the height of the Altar has to suit y  
our convenience. It is consequently in direct relation with y  
our own stature; in proportion, it is a double cube. This t  
hen determines the size of your circle; in fact the entire a  
pparatus and furniture is a geometrical function of yourself. C  
onsider it all as a projection of yourself in terms of t  
hese conventional formulae. (A convention does really mean .. t  
hat which is convenient." How abject, then, to obey a self-sty  
led convention which is actually as inconvenient as possible!

Next, the Lamp. This may be of silver, or silver-gilt, (  
to represent the Path of Gimel) and is to be hung from t  
he ceiling exactly above the centre of the altar. There are p  
lenty of old church lamps which serve very well. The light is to b  
e from a wick in a floating cork in a glass of olive oil. (I h  
ope you can get i t!) It is really desirable to make this as near t  
he "ever-burning Lamp of the Rosicrucians" as possible; it is not  
a drawback that this implies frequent a

Now for the Weapons  
! The Wand. Let this be simple, straight and slim! Have y  
ou an Almond or Witch Hazel in your garden-or do I call i  
t park? If so, cut (with the magic knife-I would lend y  
ou mine) a bough, as nearly straight as possible, about two f  
eet long. Peel it, rub it constantly with Oil of Abramelin (  
this, and his incense, from Wallis and Co., 26 New C  
avendish Street, W. l.) and keep wrapped in scarlet silk. Constantly, I

wrote, and meant it; rub it, when saying your mantra, to t  
he rhythm of that same. (Remember, "A ka dua" is the best; a

The Cup. There are plenty of chalices to be bought. I  
t should be of silver. If ornamented, the best form is that o  
f the apple. I have seen suitable cups in many s

212

The Sword. The ideal form is shown in the Ace of S  
words in the Tarot. At all events, let the blade be straight, and t  
he hilt a simple cross

The Disk. This ought to be of pure gold, with your o  
wn Pantacle, designed by yourself after prolonged study, g  
raved thereupon. While getting ready for this any plain circle o  
f gold will have to serve your turn. Quite flat, of course. If y  
ou want a good simple design to go on interim, try the R  
osy Cross or the Unicursal H  
exagra

212

So much for the Weapons! Now, as to your p  
ersonal accoutrements, Robe, Lamen, Sandals and the like, The B  
ook of the Law has most thoughtfully simplified matters for us. "  
I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, a  
nd covered with a rich head-dress." (AL, I: 61.) The Robe may   
well be in the form of the Tau Cross; i.e., expanding fro  
m axilla to ankle, and from shoulder to-whatever you call the   
place where your hands come out. (Shape well shown in t  
he illustration Magick, face p. 380.) You being a P  
robationer, plain black is correct; and the Unicursal Hexagram might be  
embroidered, or "applique" (is it? I mean "stuck on") u  
pon the breast. The best head-dress is the Nemyss: I cannot t  
rust myself to describe how to make one, but there are a  
ny number of models in the British Museum, or in a  
ny 111ustrated Hieroglyphic text. The Sphinx wears one, a  
nd there is a photograph, showing the shape and structure v  
ery c learly, in The Equinox, Vol. I, No. l, frontispiece t

broad black-and-white stripes is a pleasing design. A

You raise so vast and razor-edged a question when y  
ou write of the supposed antinomy of "soul" and "sense" that i  
t seemed better to withhold comment until this later l  
etter; much meditation was most needful to compress the a  
nswer within reasonable limits; even to give it form at all is no e  
asy matter. For this is probably the symptom of the e  
arliest stirring of the mind of the cave-man to reflection, there  
unto moved by other symptoms-those of the morning a  
fter following upon the night before. It is-have we not a  
lready dealt with that matter after a fashion?-evidence of d  
isease when an organ becomes aware of its own modes of m  
otion. Certainly the mere fact of questioning Life bears witness t  
o some interruption of its flow, just as a ripple on an e  
ven stream tells of a rock submerged. The fiercer the torrent a  
nd the bigger the obstacle, the greater the disturbance to t  
he surface-have I not seen them on the Bralduh eight feet h

Lethargic folk with no wild impulse of Will may g  
et through Life in bovine apathy; we may well note that (in a   
sense) the rage of the water seems to our perturbed i  
magining actually to increase and multiply the obstructions; there is a  
critical point beyond which the ripples fight each other

215

173

215

That, in short, is a picture of you!  
You have mistaken the flurry of passing over some a  
ctual snag for a snag in itself! You put the blame on to your o  
wn quite rational attempts to overcome difficulties. The secret o  
f the trick of getting past the rocks is elasticity; yet it is that   
very quality with which you reproach y  
oursel

215

We even, at the worst, reach the state for which B  
uddhism, in the East presents most ably the case: as in the West, d  
oes James Thomson (B.V.) in "The City of Dreadful Night"; w

r "blest Nirvana's sinless, stainless Peace" (or some s  
uch twaddle-thank God I can't recall Arnold's mawkish a

ivine repose.

Note, please, how sophistically unconvincing are t

How different, how simple, how self-evident, is the   
doctrine of The Book of the Law!  
There are any number of passages dealing with this m  
atter in my writings: let's forget them, and keep to the T  
ext! Cap. I, v. 2  
6: ... my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity o  
f existence, the omnipresence of my body  
. v. 3

complicated for this time and place!  
) v. 3

ll possible experiences) will redeem ye from all p

This chapter returns over and over again to this theme in  
one form or a  
nothe

1. "Peace": the glow of satisfaction at achievement. It is not "eternal," rather, i  
   t whets the appetite for another adventure. (Peace, = 180 = 7 x 9 x 13 = t

What is really more significant is the hidden, t  
he unexpressed, soul of the Book; the way in which it leaps i  
nto wild spate of rhapsody on any excuse or no e  
xcuse. This is surely more convincing than some dreary thesis,   
plodding along doggedly with the "proof' (!) that "God i  
s good," every sentence creaking with your chalk-stones a  
nd squeaking with the twinges of your toe!

217

Yet just because I proclaim a doctrine of joy in t  
he language of joy, people-dull camels-say I am not "seri  
ous." Yet I have found pleasure in harnessing the winged h  
orses of the Sun to the ploughshare of Reason, in showing t  
he validity of this doctrine in detail. It satisfies my sense o  
f rhythm and of symmetry to explain that every e  
xperience, no matter what, must of necessity be a gain of grandeur, of   
grip, of comprehension and enjoyment ever growing as  
complexity and simplicity succeed each other in s  
ublime systole and diastole, in strophe and antistrophe c

Of course it is easy as pie to knock all this to pieces b  
y "lunatic logic." saying: "Then toothache is really as p  
leasant as strawberry shortcake." You are hereby referred to Eight  
Lectures on Yoga. None of the terms I am using have b  
een, or can be defined. All my propositions amount to no m  
ore than tautology: A is A. You may even quote The Book of the  
Law itself: "Now a curse on Because and his kin! ... E  
nough of Because! Be he damned for a dog!" (AL, 11:28-33) T  
hese things stink of lgnoratio Elenchi, or something painfully l  
ike it: a sort of slipping up a cog, of "confusing the planes," o  
f wilfully misunderstanding the gist of an argument. (

A "relic" would have been immensely h

nourished by continual sacrifice, serve as a receptacle for t

Apollonius was indeed as refractory a subject as Levi c  
ould possibly have chosen. All the cards were against him.  
Why? Let me remind you of the sublimity of the m  
an's genius, and the extent of his attainment. Apollonius must   
certainly have made the closest links between his Ruach a  
nd his Supernal Triad, and this would have gone seeking a n  
ew incarnation elsewhere. All the available Ruach left floating   
around in the Akasha must have been compa  
ratively worthless odds and ends, true Qliphoth or "Shells of t  
he Dead" -just those parts of him, in a word, which Apol  
lonius would have deliberately discarded at his death. So what u  
se would they be to Levi? Even if there were among them a f  
ew such elements as would serve his purpose, they would h  
ave been devitalized and frittered away by the mere lapse of the   
centuries, since they had lost connection with the reality o  
f the Sage. Alternatively, they might have been caught up a

Dear me! dear me! The world's indeed gone topsy-turvy i  
f you have to ask me for the secrets of Fascination! Altog  
ether tohu-bohu and the Temurah Thash raq  
! So much for a display of Old-World Courtly M  
anners; actually rubbish, for you might very well be fa

that is the case ninety-nine times in a h  
undre

226

Besides, I read your letter carelessly; I overlooked t  
he phrase in which you mention that you use the word as L  
evi did; i.e., to cover all those types of "miracle" which d  
epend on distracting the attention of, or otherwise composing, t  
he miraclee-1 invent a rather useful word, y  
es? So let us see what sort of miracles those a

226

To start with, I doubt if we can. Many of such   
thaumaturgic phenomena contain elements of illusion in  
greater or less degree; if the miraclee's mind is 100 p  
ercent responsible, I think the business becomes a mere c  
onjuring t  
rick. My dictionary defines the verb: "to charm, to enchant; t  
o act on by some irresistible influence; to captivate; to e  
xcite and allure irresistibly or powerfully.  
" For the noun it gets even deeper into technical Magic: "  
the act or power of fascinating or spellbinding, often to o  
ne's h arm; a mysterious, irresistible, alluring influence.

227

185

227

(Personally, I have always used, or heard, it much l  
ess seriously: "attractive" hardly more.) Skeat, surprisingly, i  
s almost dumb: p. part. of "to enchant" and "from L  
. fascinum, a spell.  
" Yes, surprisingly; for the word is one of the many t  
hat mean the Phallus. The implication is that there is some s  
exual element in the exciting and alluring quality, which lifts i  
t altogether above mere "pleasin

227

To my mind the implication is that there is some q  
uality inherent which is cognate to that too totally irra  
tional quasimagnetic force which has been responsible not only fo  
r innumerable personal tragedies-and comedies-but for t  
he fall of dynasties and even the wreck of Empires.   
"Christ" is reported as having said: "If I be lifted up fr  
om the earth, I will draw all men unto me." Interpret this in t  
he light of the Cross as a Phallic emblem, and-how lurid a flash!   
Compare AL, II: 2  
6: '1 am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring; in m  
y coiling there is joy. If I lift up my head, I and my Nui  
t are one. If I droop down my head, and shoot forth v  
enom, then is rapture of the earth, and I and the earth are o ne."

227

This versicle is deep, devilish deep; and it is chock-a-bl  
ock with the mysteries of Fascination. Dig into this, dear siste  
r! dig with your Qabalistic trowel; don't blame me if you d  
on't get a Mandrake with the very first t

But most certainly I shall say nothing here. Yes, i  
ndeed, nothing was ever more sternly forbidden than prattle o  
n subjects like this! Look! It goes right on: "There is gr  
eat danger in me; for who doth not understand these runes sh  
all make a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit c  
alled Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reaso  
n." (v 27) The pit is of course the Abyss: see The Vision and t  
he Voice, 10th Aethyr. A very sticky-or rather, unstuck! fi

Now for a douche of common sense. Hatha-Yoga is q  
uite clear and simple, even logical, about it. The method is p  
lain Pranayama. Didn't I tell you one time of the Four Stages o  
f S uccess? Perspiration-of a very s pecial k  
ind. Sukshma-Khumbakam: automatic rigidity. One stiffens like a  
dog in a bell-jar when you pump in Carbon Dioxide (is i  
t?) The Bhuchari-Siddhi, '1umping about like a frog." One i  
s wafted, without one's Asana being disturbed, about the fl  
oor, rather as fragments of paper, or dry leaves, might be in a  
slight draught under the door. If one is quite perfectly   
balanced one cannot be moved sideways; so one rises. A  
nd there you a re!

229

Personally, I reached the Bhuchari-Siddhi quite a n  
umber of times; but I never observed No. 4. On several o  
ccasions other people have seen me levitated, though never to a h  
eight of more than a foot or so

Note: I don’t think it’s physical levitation, but levitation of the astral body

229

Here is the best account of such an  
incident, of those at my immediate d  
isposal. Nearly midnight. At this moment we stopped d  
ictating, and began to converse. Then Fra. P. said: "Oh, if I c  
ould only dictate a book like The Tao Teh King!" Then h  
e closed his eyes as if meditating. Just before I had   
noticed a change in his face, most extraordinary, as if h  
e were no longer the same person; in fact, in the t  
en minutes we were talking he seemed to be any number  
of different people. I especially noticed the pupils of his  
eyes were so enlarged that the entire eye seemed b  
lack. (/ tremble so and have such a quaking feeling i  
nside, simply in thinking of last night, that I c an't for  
m letters .) Then quite slowly the entire room filled with a  
thick yellow light (deep golden, but not brilliant. I m  
ean not dazzling, but soft .} Fra. P. looked like a person I  
had never seen but seemed to know quite well-his fac  
e, clothes and all were of the same yellow. I was so

230

188

230

disturbed that I looked up to the ceiling to see w  
hat caused the light, but could only see the candles. The  
n the chair on which he sat seemed to rise; it was like a   
throne, and he seemed to be either dead or sleeping; b  
ut it was certainly no longer Fra. P. This frightened m  
e, and I tried to understand by looking round the r  
oom; when I looked back the chair was raised, and he was s  
till the same. I realized I was alone; and thinking he w  
as dead or gone-or some other te"ible thing-/ los  
t consciousnes

230

This discourse has been thus left unfinished: but it is o  
nly necessary to add that the capacity to extract such s  
piritual honey from these unpromising flowers is the mark of an  
adept who has perfected his Magick Cup. This method o  
f Qabalistic exegesis is one of the best ways of exalting t  
he reason to the higher consciousness. Evidently it started F  
ra. P. so that in a moment he became completely c  
oncentrated and e

230

Note that this has nothing at all to do with a  
ny Pranayama. It seems a matter of ecstatic c  
oncentration, which chose this mode of expression instead of bringing o  
n Samadhi-though that, too, occurred in some of the c

230

By the way, here is a fairly full account of the w  
hole business ; I have just remembe red-it is in my   
Autohagiograp  
hy. Pranayama produced, firstly, a peculiar kind o  
f perspiration; secondly, an automatic rigidity of t  
he muscles; and thirdly, the very curious phenomenon o  
f causing the body, while still absolutely rigid, to t  
ake little hops in various directions. It seems as if one were   
somehow raised, possibly an inch from the ground, a  
nd deposited very gently a short distance a

230

I saw a very striking case of this at Kandy. When

231

189

231

Allan was meditating, it was my duty to bring his foo  
d very quietly (from time to time) into the r  
oom adjoining that where he was working. One day he mis  
sed two successive meals, and I thought I ought to look i  
nto his room to see if all was well. I must explain that I have   
known only two European women and three E  
uropean men who could sit in the attitude called Padmasa  
na, which is that usually seen in seated images of the   
Buddha. Of these men, Allan was one. He could knot h  
is legs so well that, putting his hands on the ground, h  
e could swing his body to and fro in the air b  
etween them. When I looked into his room I found him n  
ot seated on his meditation mat, which was in the centre o  
f the room at the end farthest from the window, but in a  
distant corner ten or twelve feet off. still in his k  
notted position, resting on his head and right shoulder, exact  
ly like an image overturned. I set him right way up, and h  
e came out of his trance. He was quite unconscious t  
hat anything unusual had happened. But he had evident  
ly been thrown there by the mysterious forces g  
enerated by Pra  
nayam

231

There is no doubt whatever about this p  
henomenon; it is quite common. But the Yogis claim that the lat  
eral motion is due to lack of balance, and that if one were i  
n perfect spiritual equilibrium one would rise directly i  
n the air. I have never seen any case of levitation, a  
nd hesitate to say that it has happened to me, though I  
have actually been seen by others, on several o  
ccasions, apparently poised in the air. For the first t  
hree phenomena I have found no difficulty in devising quit  
e simple physiological explanations. But I can form n  
o theory as to how the practice could counteract the for  
ce of gravitation, and I am unregenerate enough to allow  
this to make me sceptical about the occurrence o  
f levitation. Yet, after all, the stars are suspended in

232

190

232

space. There is no a priori reason why the forces w  
hich prevent them rushing together should not come i  
nto operation in respect of the earth and the body

232

The Allan part of this is the best evidence at my d  
isposal He couldn't have got where he did by hopping, and h  
{ couldn't have got into that position intentionally; he m  
us1 have been levitated, lost balance, and dropped upside d  
own In any case, there is no trace of fascination about it, as t  
hen may have been in Soror Virakam's observatio

232

About invisibility, now?

Note: I also think Invisibility refers to the invisibility of the astral body. They just didn’t really have words for such things back then so it literally sounds like they’re talking about physical levitation or invisibility. Just read the pali suttas on the shiddis. They make sense when you read them in the context of remote viewing, although they do briefly mention creating an “imaginary body.”

232

Of this I have so much e  
xperienc{ that the merest outline could take us far beyond the limits o  
l a letter. In Mexico D.F., I worked at acquiring the power b  
} means of ritual. I worked desperately hard. I got to the p

earliest films did. Possibly more work, after more skill hac

Roughly, this is how to do it. If one is concentrated to t  
h{ point when what you are thinking of is the only reality in th{   
Universe, when you lose all awareness of who and where y  
ot are and what you are doing, it seems as though t  
ha1 unconsciousness were in some way contagious. The p

At one time, in Sicily, this happened nearly every day. O  
m party, strolling down to our bathing bay-the loveliest spot o  
l its kind that I have ever seen-over a hillside where then   
wasn't cover for a rabbit, would lose sight of me, look, a  
nc fail to find me, though I was walking in their midst. At fi  
rst astonishment, bewilderment; at last, so normal had i

One incident I remember very vividly indeed; an old fri  
enc and I were sitting opposite each other in armchairs in front o  
l a large fire, smoking our pipes. Suddenly he lost sight of m  
e and actually cried out in alarm. I said: "What's wrong?" T  
hal broke the spell; there I was, all present and correct

Did I hear you mutter "Transmutations? Werewolves

233

In certain types of animal there appears, if tradition h  
ave any weight, to be a curious quality of-sympathy? I doubt i  
f that be the word, but can think of none better-  
which enables them to assume at times the human form. No. I-a  
nd the rest are also rans-is the seal. There is a whole body o  
f literature about this. Then come wolves, hyamas, large d  
ogs of the hunting type; occasionally leopards. Tales of cats a  
nd serpents are usually the other way round; it is the human  
(nearly always female) that assumes these shapes b  
y witchcraft. But in ancient Egypt they literally doted on t  
his sort of thing. The papyri are full of formulas for operating   
such transmutations. But I think that this was mostly t  
o afford some relaxation for the spirit of the dead man; he   
nipped out of his sarcophagus, and painted the town all t  
he colours of the rainbow in one animal shape or a

The only experience I have of anything of this sort w  
as when I was in Pacific waters, mostly at Honolulu or i  
n Nippon. I was practicing Astral Projection. A Sister of t  
he Order who lived in Hong Kong helped me. I was to visit her,   
and the token of perfect success was to be that I should   
knock a vase off the mantel-piece. We appointed certain d  
ays and hours-with some awkwardness, as my t  
ime-distance from her was constantly growing shorter-for me to pay m  
y visit. We got some remarkable results; our records of t  
he interview used to tally with surprising accuracy; but the v  
ase remained in  
tac

233

This is not one of my notorious digressions; and this is   
how transmutation comes into it. I found that by first t  
aking the shape of a golden hawk, and resuming my own form a  
fter landing in her "temple"-a room she had fitted ad hoc-  
the whole operation became incomparably easier. I shall n  
ot indulge in hypotheses of why this should have been the c  
as

A little over four years later-in the meantime we had m  
et and worked at Magi ck together-we resumed these

experiments in a somewhat different form. The success w  
as much greater; but though I could move her, and even a  
ny objects which she was touching, I could make no i  
mpression on inanimate objects at a distance from her. The behaviour o  
f her dogs, and of her cat, was very curious and i  
nteresting. Strangest of all, there appeared those "kinks in Time" w  
hich profane science is just beginning to discu�. Example: on o  
ne occasion our records of an "interview" agreed with q  
uite extraordinary precision; but, on comparing notes, it w  
as found that owing to some stupid miscalculation of mine, i  
t was all over in Hong Kong some hours before I had s  
tarted from Honolulu! Again, don't ask me why, or how, or   
anything

What do we do when we "

always be reduced to a series of one or other of these. If n  
ot, it is a sham statement; nonsense masquerading as sense in t

Analysis, and Synthesis; or, Subtraction, and A  
ddition. l. You can examine A, and find that it is composed of B  
and C. A = B + C  
. 2. You can find out what happens to B when you add C  
to it. B + C = A  
. As you notice, the two are identical, after all; but t  
he process is diffe

ture; you obtain metallic copper and oxygen gas. Heat copper in a   
stream of oxygen; you obtain copper o

You can complicate such experiments indefinitely, a

This has been put in a sort of text, because the fi  
rst stumbling-block to study is that one never has any c  
ertainty as to what the author means, or thinks he means, or is t  
rying to persuade one that he m

Try something simple: "The soul is a part of God." N  
ow then, when he writes "soul" does he mean Atma, or B  
uddhi, or the Higher Manas, or Purusha, or Yechidah, or N  
eschamah, or Nephesch, or Nous, or Psyche, or Phren, or Ba, or Khu, o  
r Ka, or Animus or Anirna, or Seele, or w  
hat? But even this very plain word "part." Does he mean to

238

196

imply a quantitative assertion, as when one says sixpence is   
part of a pound, or a factor indispensable, as when one says   
"A wheel is part of a motor-car," or .

238

The fact is that very few of us know what words m  
ean; fewer still take the trouble to enquire. We calmly, w  
e carelessly assume that our minds are identical with that o  
f the writer, at least on that point; and then we wonder t  
hat there should be misunderstandings!  
The fact is (again!) that usually we don't really want t  
o know; it is so very much easier to drift down the river o  
f discourse, "lazily, lazily, drowsily, drowsily, in the n

Why is this so satisfactory? Because although we may n  
ot know what a word means, most words have a pleasant o  
r unpleasant connotation, each for himself, either because of   
the ideas or images thus begotten, of hopes or memor  
ies stirred up, or merely for the sound of the word itself

238

Then there are devices: style-rhythm, cadence, ri  
me, ornamentation of a thousand kinds. I think one may take i  
t that the good writer makes use of such artifice to make his   
meaning clear; the bad writer to obscure it, or to conceal t  
he fact that he has none.
