## Drug users are driven to use simply to make up for the loss of dopamine activity

Just how important [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s are to substance use was illustrated by a study of mice that had previously been trained to drink alcohol. They were given an ‚Äúinfusion‚Äù of [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s right into the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md). Before the infusion these rodents had fewer than normal [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s, and [the quantity of dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens neurons determines the magnitude of reward](The%20quantity%20of%20dopamine%20receptors%20in%20the%20nucleus%20accumbens%20neurons%20determines%20the%20magnitude%20of%20reward.md). The [receptor](Receptor.md)s were incorporated into a harmless virus that entered the animals‚Äô [brain](Brain.md) [cell]()s so that, temporarily, a normal range of [receptor](Receptor.md) activity was achieved. As long as this artificial supply of [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s was available, the mice reduced their alcohol intake considerably‚Äîbut they gradually became boozers again as the implanted [receptor](Receptor.md)s were lost to natural attrition, which thereby keeps driving the addict to use the drug simply to make up for the loss of [dopamine](Dopamine.md) activity.
