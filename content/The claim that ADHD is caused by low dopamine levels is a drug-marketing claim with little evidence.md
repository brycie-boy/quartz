## The claim that ADHD is caused by low dopamine levels is a drug-marketing claim with little evidence # 

During the 1990s, the Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) advised the public that children with [[ADHD]] suffered from a [[gene]]tically caused chemical imbalance, characterized by an underactive [[mesolimbic pathway]], but that was simply a drug-marketing claim. [[Ritalin]] and other [[stimulant]]s increase [[dopamine]] levels in the [[Synapse|synaptic]] cleft, and thus CHADD was attempting to make it seem that such drugs “normalized” [[brain]] chemistry, but, as the American Psychiatric Press’s 1997 Textbook of Neuropsychiatry confessed, “efforts to identify a selective neurochemical imbalance [in [[ADHD]] children] have been disappointing.”
