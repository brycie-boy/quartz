## If you adjust for absolute income, income inequality still predicts poor health

[Income inequality is a strong predictor of poor health because it is about being made to feel poor](Income%20inequality%20is%20a%20strong%20predictor%20of%20poor%20health%20because%20it%20is%20about%20being%20made%20to%20feel%20poor.md), so Income inequality seems really important for making sense of the SES/health gradient. But maybe it isn‚Äôt that important. Maybe the inequality business is just a [red herring]() built around the fact that places with big inequalities tend to be poor places as well (in other words, back to the key thing being ‚Äúpoverty,‚Äù instead of ‚Äúpoverty amid plenty‚Äù). But, control for absolute income, and the inequality data still stand.
