#### Notes

Amount: 22

- [[Behaviorism assumes that it is external entities that control learning]]
- [[Psychologists were quick to begin using conditioning on children soon after it's conception]]
- [[Around the 1960s, cognitive psychologists became dissatisfied with behaviorism for understanding learning and started focusing more on thought]]
- [[Cognitive scientists measured learning through observation of natural learning or through tests in controlled settings]]
- [[The cognitive science approach to learning strips it of it's context and meaning to the student]]
- [[A cognitive model of learning which suggests that learning is only the commitment of information to long-term memory has gained precedence in schools]]
- [[Schools have extrapolated form chess professionals that storing information into long-term memory ahead of time will prepare them for expertise later]]
- [[People become experts in something by actively doing it rather than by preparing for it]]
- [[Experts have purpose and context in what they learn because they have chosen to learn it]]
- [[The cognitive approach to learning overlooks the role of environment in a students capacity to learn something]]
- [[Children make logical choices based on what they already know when confronted with contradictory information]]
- [[Instructing a child's education can prevent them from learning other possibilities by making them more likely to imitate]]
- [[Children learn by actively using their own prior knowledge to understand new experiences]]
- [[Informally educated children learn through personal observation and imitation, whereas school children tend to learn by waiting for someone else to show them what to do]]
- [[Education should be oriented toward whatever is important in the students particular culture and environment]]
- [[Community of practice]]
- [[Learning outside of school involves active doing and purpose, whereas learning in school involves abstracted standardized outcomes]]
- [[Learning by immersion makes it difficult to ascertain ones progress because their are no preconfigured testing methods]]
