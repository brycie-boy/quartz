## Paraphier

If we look more carefully at the nature of metaphor we find that it is composed of more than a [metaphier](Metaphier.md) and a [metaphrand](Metaphrand.md). There are also at the bottom of most complex metaphors various associations or attributes of the [metaphier](Metaphier.md) which may be referred to as paraphiers.
