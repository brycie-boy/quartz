## Axon  #🧠

An axon is a is a long, slender projection of a [neuron](Neuron.md) that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the [soma](). The function of the axon is to transmit information to different [neurons](), muscles, and glands. The end branches of an axon are called telodendria. The swollen end of a telodendron is known as the axon terminal which joins the [dendrite](Dendrite.md) or [soma]() of another [neuron](Neuron.md) forming a [synaptic](Synapse.md) connection. Axons make contact with other cells – usually other [neuron](Neuron.md)s but sometimes muscle or gland cells – at junctions called [synapse](Synapse.md)s.
