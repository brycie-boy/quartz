## Axon  #🧠 

An axon is a is a long, slender projection of a [[neuron]] that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the [[soma]]. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different [[neurons]], muscles, and glands. The end branches of an axon are called telodendria. The swollen end of a telodendron is known as the axon terminal which joins the [[dendrite]] or [[soma]] of another [[neuron]] forming a [[Synapse|synaptic]] connection. Axons make contact with other cells – usually other [[neuron]]s but sometimes muscle or gland cells – at junctions called [[synapse]]s.
