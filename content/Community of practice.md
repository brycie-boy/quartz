## Community of practice

Communities of practice is a concept first proposed by cognitive anthropologist [Jean Lave]() and educational theorist Etienne Wenger in 1991. Communities of practice are where people come together with a collective purpose, or to do something together. Through their interactions with each other, they learn, and they share information and experiences. The learning is embedded in the practice.
