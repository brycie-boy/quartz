## Community of practice # 

Communities of practice is a concept first proposed by cognitive anthropologist [[Jean Lave]] and educational theorist Etienne Wenger in 1991. Communities of practice are where people come together with a collective purpose, or to do something together. Through their interactions with each other, they learn, and they share information and experiences. The learning is embedded in the practice.
