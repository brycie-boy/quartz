## Most people at risk for diabetes cannot prevent it with diet and exercise

While exercise and diet can prevent [diabetes](Diabetes.md) on the individual level, it doesn’t work at the societal level. Yes, the relative risk for lifestyle interventions in preventing [diabetes](Diabetes.md) is 0.61—that means, if you can carry out those interventions, your risk for [diabetes](Diabetes.md) goes down 39 percent. Sounds good, right? If you’re one of the people for whom it works, then fantastic. But the relative risk is not the important factor. The the number of people who have to go on a diet and lose weight to prevent one case of [diabetes](Diabetes.md)—is twenty-five. That’s right, twenty-five people have to diet and exercise rigorously to prevent one of them from progressing on to developing [diabetes](Diabetes.md).

No doubt you’ve also watched some TV-doctor show where the guest dropped weight, their [diabetes](Diabetes.md) got better, their [insulin](Insulin.md) went down, and they got a makeover. Cue studio applause. But it’s actually the other way around. Their [insulin](Insulin.md) didn’t go down because their weight went down—their weight went down because their [insulin](Insulin.md) went down. [Weight gain occurs after metabolic syndrome](Weight%20gain%20occurs%20after%20metabolic%20syndrome.md).  Dr. [Robert H. Lustig]()  and colleuges got children’s [insulin](Insulin.md)s to go down without losing any weight, simply by getting them off dietary sugar. What they lost as a result was [liver]() fat, which then made them [insulin sensitive](). Again, [modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it](Modern%20medicine%20tends%20to%20target%20the%20pathology%20of%20an%20illness%20rather%20than%20preventing%20it.md).
