## The right hemisphere recognizes and groups things by comparing them with an exemplar whereas the left recognizes things by categories

Both [brain hemisphere]()s are involved in recognition according to the grouping of experience. But how they do this in practice differs in vital respects which have a direct impact on the nature of the world that each brings into being. The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s version is more global and holistic, based on the recognition of similarity with an ideal exemplar, and on where this is positioned in the context of other examples, whereas the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) identifies single features that would place the object in a certain category in the abstract. As a result, where the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) utilizes abstract categories, the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) operates more effectively using specific exemplars. Functional imaging of the [brain](Brain.md) shows that the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) takes an invariant view in its representation of objects, where the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) uses stored ‚Äòreal world‚Äô views in order to group experience.
