## We tend to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the effect of small actions on a daily basis

Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by one year. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. The effects of small [habit](Habit.md)s compound over time.

[Habit](Habit.md)s are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your [habit](Habit.md)s multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good [habit](Habit.md)s and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.
