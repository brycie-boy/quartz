## Psychedelics capacity to help people entertain new ideas may allow them create new stories of who they are  # 

For the unwell, the patients who stand to gain the most from the fact that [[The capacity for psychedelics to break habitual thought patterns may help adults be able to entertain new ideas]] are probably those suffering from the kinds of mental disorders characterized by excessive [[low-entropy state]]s: [[addiction]], [[depression]], obsession. There are a range of difficulties and pathologies in adults, like [[depression]], that are connected with the phenomenology of rumination and an excessively narrow, [[ego]]-based focus characterized by the functions of [[default mode network]]. You get stuck on the same thing, you can‚Äôt escape, you become obsessive, perhaps [[addiction|addicted]]. It seems plausible that the [[psychedelic]] experience could help us get out of those states and create an opportunity in which the old stories of who we are might be rewritten. The experience could work as a kind of reset‚Äîas when you introduce a burst of entropy into a system that has gotten locked into a rigid pattern. Quieting the [[default mode network]] and loosening the grip of the [[ego]] through practices such as [[mindfulness]] might also be helpful to such people. In fact [[psychedelic therapy has shown an 80 percent absency rate after six months and 67 percent after one-year]].
