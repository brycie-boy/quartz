## We generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs #üß† 

Most mammals are incapable of criticizing or examining there own neural programs. To a mammilian animal, something that seemed "bad" once will always seem "bad" and it, or anything that looks like it, will be reflexively attacked or fled. Such programs are created by the processes of [[imprint]]ing and [[conditioning]], which lead to [[subjective bias]]es.

These mechanical programs interact with a linguistic [[reality tunnel]] to produce a characteristic vocabulary, from which behavior can often be predicted mechanically. If one hears the language of the Ku Klux Klan, then they might predict how a black human would be treated by that group. If one hears the language of Radical Feminism, they might predict how a male human would be regarded by that group. If one hears the language of [[Fundamentalism|Fundamentalist]] [[Materialism|Materialists]], they might predict how a [[remote viewing]] report will be recieved. Etc.
