## The trajectory your daily actions are leading you toward matters more than their current results

The impact created by a change in your [habit](Habit.md)s is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart. Similarly, a slight change in your daily [habit](Habit.md)s can guide your life to a very different destination. [We tend to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the effect of small actions on a daily basis](We%20tend%20to%20overestimate%20the%20importance%20of%20one%20defining%20moment%20and%20underestimate%20the%20effect%20of%20small%20actions%20on%20a%20daily%20basis.md). Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily [habit](Habit.md)s—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
