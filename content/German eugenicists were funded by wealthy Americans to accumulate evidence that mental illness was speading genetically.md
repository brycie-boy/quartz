## German eugenicists were funded by wealthy Americans to accumulate evidence that mental illness was speading genetically

In the U.S., [The eugenics movement had established the paradigm that mental illness was genetically inherited](The%20eugenics%20movement%20had%20established%20the%20paradigm%20that%20mental%20illness%20was%20genetically%20inherited.md), and much as U.S. [geneticists]() had, German [eugenicists](Eugenics.md) sought to develop scientific evidence that mental illnesses were inherited and that such [gene]()tic disease was spreading through its population. American money helped fund this effort. In 1925, the [Rockefeller Foundation]() gave $2.5 million to the Psychiatric Institute in Munich, which quickly became Germany’s leading center for [eugenics](Eugenics.md) research. In addition, it gave money to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human [Gene]()tics and [Eugenics](Eugenics.md) in Berlin, which was used to pay for a national survey of “degenerative traits” in the German population.
