Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the L

You want to k  
now what the Odds are when I say "certain.  
" A case for casuistry? At least, for classification. It d  
epends rather on one's tone of voice? Yes, of course, and as to t  
he classification, off we jog to the Divine Pymander, who s  
aw, and stated, the quiddity of our query with his a  
ccustomed lucidity. He discerns three degrees of Truth; and h  
e distinguishes accordingly:  
1. T  
rue 2. Certain without e  
rror 3. Of all t  
ruth. Clear enough, the difference between 1 and 2: ask me t  
he time, I say half-past two; and that's true enough. But t  
he Astronomer Royal is by no manner of means satisfied w  
ith any approximation of that kind. He wants it accurate. H  
e must know the longitude to the second; he must have   
decided what method of measuring time is to be used; h

must make corrections for this and for that ; and he m  
ust have attached an (arbitrary) interpretation to the system; the   
whole question of Relativity pops up. And, even so, he w  
ill enter a caveat about every single ganglion in the gossamer o  
f his c  
alculations. Well then, all this intricate differentiation and i  
ntegration and verification and Lord knows what leads at last to a  
statement which may be called "Certain without E

But Hennes Trismegistus is not content with any s  
uch fugues as the Astronomer, however cunning and colossal h  
is Ortan ; his Third Degree demands much more than this. T  
he Astronomer's estimate has puttied every tiniest crack, h  
e concedes it, but then waves it brusquely away: all the t  
ime the door is standing wide open!

253

The Astronomer's exquisitely tailored figure stands i  
n abashed isolation, like a gawky young man at his first Ball; he   
feels·that he doesn't belong. For this D.S.T., or Greenwich, o  
r what not, however exact in itself, is so only in reference t  
o some other set of measurements which themselves tum o  
ut to be arbitrary; it is not of any ultimate import; nobody c  
an dispute it, but it simply doesn't matter to anybody, a  
part from the particular case. It is not "Of all Tru  
th." What Hennes means by this it will be well to e  
nquir

May we call it "a truth of Religion"? (Don't be shocked!  
The original word implies a binding-together-again, as in a  
"Body of Doctrine"; compare the word Ligature. It was o  
nly later, by corruption, that the word came to imply "piety";  
re-ligens, attentive [to the gods] as opposed to neg-lige  
ns, neglectful.

I think that Hermes was contemplating a Ruach c  
losely knitted together and anchored by incessant Aspiration to t  
he Supernal Triad; just such an one, in short, as appears in t  
hose remarks on the Magical Memory, a God-man ready to d  
iscard his well-worn Instrument for a new one, brought up to d  
ate with all the latest improvements (the movement of t  
he Zeitgeist during his past incarnation, in particular) w

This being so, a truth which is "of all Truth" should m

Now how curious it must appear at the first glance to n  
ote that the truths of this order should prove to be what we c  
all Axioms-or even P  
latitudes. "The more certain I am of anything, the more certain it i  
s that I am only asserting a limitation of my own m

Very good, but what am I to do about it? Some at least o  
f such certainties must surely be "of all Truth." The test of   
admission to this class ought to be that, if one were to a  
ccept the contradictory of the proposition, the entire structure o  
f the Mind would be knocked to pieces, as is not at all the c  
ase with the Astronomer's determination, which may tum out t  
o be wrong for a dozen different reasons without anybody   
getting seriously wounded in his tenderest feelings.

The Statesman knows instinctively, or at worst, by his  
training and experience, what sort of assertion, harmless   
enough on the surface, may be "dangerous thinking," a  
death-blow to his own idea of what is "of all Truth," a  
nd strikes out wildly in a panic entirely justifiable from his o  
wn point of view. Exhibit No. l: Galileo and that lot. W  
hat could it possibly matter to the Gospel story that p  
eople should think that the Earth moves round the Sun? (Ri  
emann, and oh! such a lot of things, have shown that it didn't a  
nd doesn't! This sort of "Truth" is only a set of c

"Oh, don't gas away like this! I want to know what to d

nd enlarge my Mind, and call it an Initiation? Or am I to nail m  
y own of-all-Truth Tonic Solf a to the Mast, and go down into   
the Maelstrom of Insanity with colours flying?"

ereinafter referred to as-not a Heretic, an Atheist, a Bolshie, a  
Die-hard, a Schismatic, an Anarchist, a Black Magician, a  
Friend of Aleister Crowley, or whatever may be the curren  
t term of abuse-Mr. A, Lord B, the Duke of C, Mrs. X, o

You naturally object that this answer is little better t  
han an evasion, that it automatically pushes the Gamut quest  
ion outside the Charmed of-all-Truth Circle  
. No, it doesn't really; for if you were able to put up a  
Projection of those two minds, there would be, firstly, s  
ome sort of compensation elsewhere than in the musical se  
ction; and secondly, some Truth of a yet higher order which i

Not unaware am I that these conceptions are at   
first exceedingly difficult to formulate clearly. I wouldn't go s  
o far as to say that one would have to be a Master of t  
he Temple to understand them; but it is really very necessary t  
o have grasped firmly the doctrine that "a thing is only t  
rue insofar as it contains its contradiction in itself." (A good w  
ay to realize this is by keeping up a merry dance of p  
aradoxes, such as infest Logic and Mathematics. The repeated b  
utting of the head against a brick wall is bound in the long run t  
o shake up the little grey cells [as Poirot might sa y], teach y  
ou to distrust any train of argument, however a  
pparently impeccable the syllogisms, and to seek ever more eagerly t  
he dawn of that Neschamic consciousness where all these things   
are clearly understood, although impossible to express in  
rational language.

The prime function of intellect is differentiation; it d  
eals with marks, with limits, with the relations of what is n  
ot identical; in Neschamah all this work has been carried out s  
o perfectly that the "rough working" has passed clean out o

We may then, with some confidence, reaffirm that o  
ur certainties do assert our limitations; but this kind o  
f limitation is not necessarily harmful, provided that we v  
iew the situation in its proper perspective, that we u  
nderstand that membership of the of-all-Truth class does not (as one i  
s apt to think at first sight) deepen the gulfs which s  
eparate mind from mind, but on the contrary put us in a position t  
o ignore them. Our acts of "love under will," which express o  
ur devotion to Nuit, which multiply the fulfilments of o  
ur possibilities, become continually more efficacious, and m  
ore closely bound up with our Formula of Initiation; and w  
e progressively become aware of deeper and vaster Images of   
the of-all-Truth class, which reconcile, by including w

It is certain without error that I ought to go to b
