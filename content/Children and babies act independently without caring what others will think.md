## Children and babies act independently without caring what others will think #🧠 

Babies and children are great examples of [[self-reliance]]. They have have not yet been exposed to the demands and customs of their society. They are intuitively aware of their desires, uninhibited by what someone else may think of them. They express themselves with complete authenticity and [[non-forcing]]. The child’s claims should not be discarded too quickly, for they stand by themselves.

The nonchalance of children who defy authority and do or say whatever conciliates them is the healthy attitude of human nature. The child is independent, irresponsible, and observes from their own perspective the people and facts that pass them by, and they test them on their merits. They do not worry about consequences or interests. They give an independent and genuine verdict.

But the adult, who has thoroughly instilled these customs, refrains from [[Self-reliance]]. When they speak with confidence, they will be watched by the sympathy or hatred of many people whose affections must now enter into their account.
