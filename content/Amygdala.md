## Amygdala  #🧠

The amygdala is a walnut-shaped area—one on either side of the [brain](Brain.md)—resposible for scanning the environment for threats and talking with other areas of the [brain](Brain.md) to determine how one should handle it. How the amygdala interacts with the rest of the [brain](Brain.md) in response to stress determines how you respond. Stress is inevitable. It’s the amygdala scanning the scene and how it connects with our other emotions that determines whether we will be safe or sorry. This occurs before we are conscious of the stimuli.

When a threat is detected by the amygdala, several things occur. First, the amygdala activates the [sympathetic nervous system](Sympathetic%20nervous%20system.md). Second, the amygdala activates the [HPA axis](HPA%20axis.md) sequence. Third, the amygdala is normally in reciprocal communication with the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md). When your [amygdala](Amygdala.md) figures out that an experience is not a good one, that information ends up stored by the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md).
