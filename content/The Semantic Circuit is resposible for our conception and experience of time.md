## The Semantic Circuit is resposible for our conception and experience of time

We often agonize over emotional decisions, becoming acutely conscious of time as we hesitate. As every suspense writer knows, the principle way to increase emotional tension is to set a time limit on a difficult or dangerous decision. On the [Time-Binding Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md), time becomes conceptualized as well as experienced. We know ourselves as creatures of time; the ‚Äútale of the tribe,‚Äù the totem pole, the Odyssey of Homer, the Old Testament, the Vedas, etc. tell us what came before and often contains prophecies of what will come later. Science expands the [Time-Binding Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md) into contemplation of time-spans that stagger our imaginations. The very use of written languages and other symbols like mathematics creates the time-binding sense of [Alfred Korzybski](): we know ourselves as receivers of messages sent by sages ‚Äúof olde‚Äù and as potential transmitters of messages that may be scanned ages in the future.
