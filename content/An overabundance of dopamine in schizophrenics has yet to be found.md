## An overabundance of dopamine in schizophrenics has yet to be found

In 1974, Dr. [Micheal Bowers]() and his team had measured the level of [dopamine](Dopamine.md) metabolites in the [cerebrospinal fluid]() of unmedicated [schizophrenics]() and found them to be quite normal. ‚ÄúOur findings,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúdo not furnish neurochemical evidence for an over-arousal in these patients emanating from a [midbrain]() [dopamine](Dopamine.md) system.‚Äù Others soon reported similar results. In 1975, [Robert Post]() at the NIMH determined that HVA levels in the [cerebrospinal fluid]() of twenty unmedicated [schizophrenic]()s ‚Äúwere not significantly different from controls.‚Äù Autopsy studies also revealed that the [brain](Brain.md) tissue of drug-free [schizophrenic]()s did not have abnormal levels of [dopamine](Dopamine.md). In 1982, UCLA‚Äôs [John Haracz]() reviewed this body of research and drew the obvious bottom-line conclusion: ‚ÄúThese findings do not support the presence of elevated [dopamine](Dopamine.md) turnover in the [brain](Brain.md)s of \[unmedicated\] [schizophrenic]()s.‚Äù
