Goals

93

if you want to compel people to act, you whittle down overwhelming goals into smaller goals that are concrete and easier to manage. Humans are driven by a sense of progress, and progress is easier to perceive when the finish line is in sight.

goals often inspire action because they become fixation points.

106

Goals have been around for as long as our planet has sustained life. What has changed, though, is how much of our lives are occupied by goal pursuit. Once upon a time goals were mostly about survival. We foraged for food and preened for attractive mates, and these activities were critical to the survival of our species. Goals were a biological imperative rather than a luxury or a choice. Our species would never have survived had our ancestors spent their time pursuing goals for no good reason. When food and energy were scarce, the guy who climbed the nearest mountain just for fun, or ran a hundred miles just to see if he could, didn’t last very long at all. Today, for much of the world, food and energy are abundant, and you can live a long and happy life while choosing to take on unnecessary hardships like mountaineering and ultramarathon running. And once you’ve finished climbing one mountain or running one race, you can start preparing for the next one, because today goals are far more than just destinations; today we’re fixated on the journey, and often the act of reaching the goal is an incidental anticlimax.

107

Even beyond the world of books, goals have become harder to escape. The Internet has exposed people to goals they barely knew existed, and wearable tech devices have made goal tracking effortless and automatic. Where once you had to seek out new goals, today they land, often uninvited, in your inbox and on your screen. We might get by if we were able to leave those emails unread for hours or even days at a time, but to the detriment of productivity and well-being, we can’t help responding to new emails almost as soon as they arrive.

107

How long do you think the average office email goes unread? I guessed ten minutes. The truth is just six seconds. In reality, 70 percent of office emails are read within six seconds of arriving. Six seconds is less time than it’s taken you to read this paragraph so far, but it’s long enough for the average worker to disrupt whatever he’s doing to open his email program and click on the incoming email. This is hugely disruptive: by one estimate, it takes up to twenty-five minutes to become re-immersed in an interrupted task. If you open just twenty-five emails a day, evenly spaced across the day, you’ll spend literally no time in the zone of maximum productivity.

108

The solution is to disable new email notifications and to check your email account infrequently, but most people don’t treat email that way. Many of us pursue the unforgiving goal of Inbox Zero, which requires you to process and file away every single unread email as soon as it arrives. And, as Chuck Klosterman wrote in the New York Times, emails are like zombies: you keep killing them and they keep coming. Inbox Zero also explains why workers spend a quarter of their days dealing with emails, and why they check their accounts, on average, thirty-six times every hour. In one study, researchers found that 45 percent of respondents associated email with “a loss of control.” This from a mode of communication that barely existed until the twenty-first century.

108

In 2012, three researchers wanted to investigate what happens when you prevent office workers from using email for a few days, but they struggled to find volunteers. They approached dozens of office workers at a U.S. Army facility on the East Coast, but only thirteen were willing to participate in the study. The vast majority explained that they couldn’t bear the pain of sorting through hundreds of unanswered emails when the study ended. Inbox Zero never dies; it just grows angrier while you try to ignore it.

109

The researchers monitored the thirteen volunteers for eight days in total: three days as they continued using email as they usually did, and then five days while they refrained from using email altogether. At first the volunteers felt disconnected from their workmates, but quickly took to walking around the office and using their desk phones. They also left the office more often, spending three times as long outside when they were forbidden from using email. Apparently email kept them shackled to their desks. They were also better workers, switching between tasks half as often, and spending longer on each task without distraction. Most important, though, they were healthier. When checking email, they were in a constant state of high alert; without email, their heart rates tended to vary more, rising in response to brief bursts of stress, but falling again when those stressors passed. With email they were constantly on red alert.

115

Streaks uncover the major flaw with goal pursuit: you spend far more time pursuing the goal than you do enjoying the fruits of your success. Even if you succeed, success is brief. Writing for the Guardian, human behavior expert Oliver Burkeman explained:

When you approach life as a sequence of milestones to be achieved, you exist “in a state of near-continuous failure.” Almost all the time, by definition, you’re not at the place you’ve defined as embodying accomplishment or success. And should you get there, you’ll find you’ve lost the very thing that gave you a sense of purpose—so you’ll formulate a new goal and start again.

116

Burkeman was quoting from Scott Adams, the cartoonist and creator of the Dilbert comic strip, who condemned goal pursuit in his book, How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. Adams promoted an alternative: instead of goals, live your life by systems. A system is “something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run.”

116

In contrast to goals, systems bring a steadier stream of low-grade highs. They’re guides to a fulfilling life, day by day, rather than enticing pictures of some grand end goal without instructions for how to get there.

116

Systems stand in stark contrast to goals like “attract one thousand Instagram followers,” which serve only as signposts of failure. When you do reach your goal, a new one materializes in its place—now two thousand Instagram followers seems like an appropriate target. The defining goal of our time, perhaps, is to amass a certain sum of money. That sum begins small but grows over time. In 2014, a former Wall Street trader named Sam Polk published an op-ed in the New York Times titled “For the Love of Money.” Polk explained that his goal was modest, at first, and then escalated repeatedly. “I’d gone from thrilled at my first bonus—$40,000—to being disappointed when, my second year at the hedge fund, I was paid ‘only’ $1.5 million.” Some of Polk’s bosses were billionaires, so he, too, wanted a billion dollars. “On a trading desk, everyone sits together, from interns to managing directors,” Polk said. “When the guy next to you makes $10 million, $1 million or $2 million doesn’t look so sweet.”

117

Polk was describing the principle of social comparison. We constantly compare what we have to what other people have, and the conclusions we draw depend on who those people are. A bonus of $40,000 looks terrific when you remember that some of your friends earn $40,000 a year; but if your friends are high-flying traders who earn $40,000 a week, you’ll be disappointed. Humans are inherently aspirational; we look ahead rather than backward, so no matter where we stand, we’ll tend to focus on people who have more. That experience produces a feeling of loss, or deprivation, relative to those other people. That’s why Polk was never happy; no matter how much he earned, there was always someone who earned more. As ridiculous as it may sound, even billionaires are poor next to multibillionaires, so they, too, feel the sting of relative deprivation.

118

I asked Polk whether his experience was common. “I think it’s 90-plus percent pervasive in finance, and I also think it goes way beyond finance.” Polk reminded me of a recent Powerball draw that attracted millions of entrants vying for a colossal $1.6 billion jackpot. Polk was convinced that this perpetual goal, even among the very wealthy, reflected a “lack of connection with your life’s work.” You don’t need to keep score with money if you’re truly, deeply motivated by what you’re doing. Goals function as placeholders that propel you forward when the daily systems that run your life are no longer fulfilling. Echoing Adams and Burkeman, Polk told me that the key is to find something that brings you small doses of positive feedback. He also believes that wealth addiction is a relatively new phenomenon. In his 1989 book, Liar’s Poker, Michael Lewis, a former trader himself, wrote that traders once believed they were performing a social function. They funded important projects and made sure money traveled from where it was to where it could be more useful. It fueled the construction of buildings and industry, and created thousands of jobs. But that illusion has gone, Polk says, as has the intrinsic motivation to trade for anything but personal gain. In 2010, Polk left Wall Street behind, choosing instead to write a book, and to found a food nonprofit called Groceryships.

119

In moderation, personal goal-setting makes intuitive sense, because it tells you how to spend your limited time and energy. But today, goals visit themselves upon us, uninvited. Sign up for a social media account, and soon you’ll seek followers and likes. Create an email account, and you’ll forever chase an empty inbox. Wear a fitness watch, and you’ll need to walk a certain number of steps each day. Play Candy Crush and you’ll need to break your existing high score. If your pursuit happens to be governed by time or numbers—running a marathon, say, or measuring your salary—goals will come in the form of round numbers and social comparisons. You may find you want to run faster and earn more than other people, and to beat certain natural milestones. Running a marathon in 4:01 will seem like a failure, as will earning $99,500. These goals pile up, and they fuel addictive pursuits that bring failure or, perhaps worse, repeated success that spawns one new ambitious goal after another.

Social Interaction

210

It’s easy to see why Zuckerberg chose to acquire Instagram. He and Systrom shared a similar insight: that people are endlessly driven to compare themselves to others. We take photos to capture memories that we’ll revisit privately, but primarily to share those memories with others. In the 1980s, that meant inviting friends over to watch slides of your recent vacation, but today that means uploading photos of your vacation in real time. What makes Facebook and Instagram so addictive is that every activity you post either does—or doesn’t—attract likes, regrams, and comments. If one photo turns out to be a dud, there’s always next time. It’s endlessly renewable because it’s as unpredictable as people’s lives are themselves.

210

People are never really sure of their own self-worth, which can’t be measured like weight, or height, or income. Some people obsess over social feedback more than others do, but we’re social beings who can’t ever completely ignore what other people think of us. And more than anything, inconsistent feedback drives us nuts.

211

Instagram is a font of inconsistent feedback. One of your photos might attract a hundred likes and twenty positive comments, while another posted ten minutes later attracts thirty likes and no comments at all. People clearly value one photo more than the other, but what does that mean? Are you “worth” a hundred likes, thirty likes, or a different number altogether? Social psychologists have shown that we adopt positive ideas about ourselves more readily than we adopt negative ideas. To see how this works, answer the following questions quickly, without giving them too much thought:

  

Below you’ll see a list of personality traits.

Please estimate the percentage of people in your town who embody less of each trait than you do:

sensitive

sophisticated

ingenious

disciplined

neurotic

impractical

submissive

compulsive

These are all ambiguous traits so it’s hard to know how much of them you or anyone else really possesses. Note also that some of them are positive (the ones on the top row), while others are negative (the ones on the bottom row).

213

When students at Cornell University answered the same questions relative to their Cornell peers, they said they expressed more of the positive traits than 64 percent of other Cornell students, but more of the negative traits than only 38 percent of Cornell students. This rosy view captures how we generally see ourselves—and perhaps it means that we’ll pay close attention to the positive feedback and ignore the negative feedback we get on Instagram.

213

But as much as we value ourselves, we’re also very sensitive to negative feedback. Psychologists call this the “bad is stronger than good” principle, and it’s very consistent across different experiences. If you’re like most people, your instinct is to scroll to the negative reviews on Amazon, TripAdvisor, and Yelp, because nothing cements an opinion like sharp criticism. You’re also more likely to remember bad events from your past, and to ruminate over old arguments longer than you bask in recent praise. Even people who had happy childhoods, when asked to recall their lives as kids, are more likely to remember the few memories that were bad rather than the many that were good.

214

There are so many photos on Instagram that you might expect users to shrug off negative feedback. People should pay less attention to the “likes” under one Instagram photo than to the photos displayed at a solo art show or passed around to friends. In truth, though, the spotlight seems to find us even when we’re in a crowd. In 2000, a group of psychologists asked college students to walk into a room filled with other students while wearing a T-shirt featuring a photo of Barry Manilow. (An unnecessary pre-test confirmed that college students prefer not to wear a Barry Manilow shirt in public.) After a few minutes, an experimenter escorted the unlucky subjects from the room, and asked them to guess how many of their fellow students noticed the Barry Manilow shirt. Of course they had been preoccupied by the shirt the entire time, so they guessed that half the students in the room would recall the shirt; in truth, only one in five remembered seeing Barry Manilow’s likeness. A dud photo that attracts only three likes on Instagram is a bit like a Barry Manilow shirt. It’s embarrassing to its owner, who assumes that other users are staring and laughing, when in fact they’re far more concerned with their own photos, or at least with the endless line of photos that come before and after the “Manilow” shot.

The sting of negative feedback is so potent that many users take hundreds of shots before posting. Apps like

218

When they designed Hot or Not, James Hong and Jim Young were smart to include the same feature that made Instagram so successful: an engine for social feedback. After each rating, users discovered how closely their impressions matched the impressions of thousands of other users. Sometimes they matched and sometimes they didn’t, and both outcomes satisfied basic human motives: the need for social confirmation when they matched, and the need for individuality when they didn’t. (Of course it didn’t hurt that users were rating facial attractiveness rather than, say, the attractiveness of different landscapes. With our inbuilt drive to scan the horizon for potential mates and competitors, we’re naturally interested in physical attractiveness.)

219

Social confirmation, or seeing the world as others see it, is a marker that you belong to a group of like-minded people. In evolutionary terms, group members tended to survive while loners were picked off, one by one, so discovering that you’re a lot like other people is deeply reassuring. When people are deprived of these bonds, they experience a form of pain so severe that it’s sometimes called “the social death penalty.” It’s also very long-lasting—just remembering a time when someone excluded you is enough to rekindle the same agony, and people often list cases of social exclusion among their darkest memories. Discovering that you see a face the same way as other people see it is a route to belonging; it confirms that other people share your version of reality. Social confirmation is brief, and we need fresh doses all the time. It was this desire for repeated confirmation that nudged Hot or Not’s users to rate “just one more photo” over and over again.

Mistaking a want with a need. Just because you feel like you need it doesn’t mean you do. They do the same thing with sex. It’s like saying meth is a need

219

Occasional disagreement has its own benefits, though, because it serves to remind you that you’re not like everyone else. Psychologists call this perfect balance the level of “optimal distinctiveness,” and you tend to strike it when you agree with other people about most but not all things. Everyone strikes that balance differently but the beauty of Hot or Not was that it provided both forms of feedback. Hot or Not was the Instagram of photo-rating sites, but it could have just as easily gone the way of Hipstamatic had Hong and Young chosen to disable the feedback engine. Instead, it thrived as thousands of users were driven to discover whether their version of hot mirrored the version endorsed by everyone else.

Doan explained why a brain raised on online friendships can never fully adjust to interactions in the real world. In the 1950s and 1970s, in a famous series of experiments, vision researchers Colin Blakemore and Grahame Cooper showed that what a young kitten sees shapes how his brain works for the rest of his life. In one experiment, they confined the kittens to a very dark room until they were five months old. Once a day, they removed half the kittens from the room and placed them in a cylinder covered with horizontal black and white stripes. They removed the other half and placed them in a similar cylinder, this one covered with vertical black and white stripes. So, half the kittens saw only vertical lines, and half saw only horizontal lines. They explained that, for each kitten, “There were no corners to its environment, and the upper and lower limits to its world were a long way away. It could not even see its own body, for it wore a wide black collar that restricted its visual field.” They added, providing little comfort to anyone even remotely concerned with animal welfare, that “The kittens did not seem upset by the monotony of their surroundings and they sat for long periods inspecting the walls of the tube.”

226

When Blakemore and Cooper allowed the kittens to roam a normal room, they were very confused. All of them, regardless of whether they’d been exposed to horizontal or vertical lines, struggled to judge how far away they were from physical objects. They bumped into table legs, failed to jump back when the experimenter acted like he was about to tap their faces, and couldn’t follow moving objects unless they made a noise. (If you’ve seen how avidly cats follow laser pointers, you know how strange it is when a cat ignores a rolling ball.) When Blakemore and Cooper examined the kittens’ brains for activity, they found that the kittens reared in vertical environments showed no activity at all in response to horizontal lines, while those reared in horizontal environments did not respond to vertical lines. Their brains were effectively blind to whatever they hadn’t been exposed to naturally during the first few months of their lives. This, Andy Doan told me, was irreversible. The visual cortex inside these poor kittens’ heads had been pickled forever, and even exposing them to normal environments for the rest of their lives did nothing to reverse many of the effects of their stunted early lives.

226

Doan drew an analogy to Hilarie Cash’s reSTART inpatients. The technical term for what Blakemore and Cooper induced in their kittens is visual amblyopia (Greek for “blunt vision”). Doan told me that children reared on the Internet suffer a kind of emotional amblyopia. Children develop different mental skills at different ages, during so-called critical periods. They pick up new languages with ease until ages four or five, after which they only pick up new languages with considerable effort. A similar idea holds for developing social skills—and for learning how to navigate the complex world of teenage sexuality. If kids miss out on the chance to interact face-to-face, there’s a fair chance they’ll never acquire those skills.

227

Cash has seen dozens of adolescents, mainly boys but also girls, who have no problem interacting with peers online, but can’t carry a conversation with someone sitting across from them. The problem worsens when you encourage adolescent males and females to interact. “How do you learn to talk and flirt and date and end up in bed if you’ve only mixed with other people online?” Cash asked. “Our guys get sidetracked, and they develop intimacy disorders. They don’t have the skills to bring sexuality and intimacy together. Many of them turn to pornography instead of forming real relationships, and they never seem to understand true intimacy.” Cash referred to “our guys” because the center no longer admits women. “For four years we admitted women, but we had to revise our policy after a number of patients ignored the ‘no physical intimacy’ rule. We had many more male applicants in those days, so we decided to stop taking women. Now, with the rise of non-violent casual and social gaming, there are almost as many female applicants. We may have to reconsider our policy.”

227

Even addicts who, like Isaac Vaisberg, somehow win the charisma lottery are susceptible to a range of psychological and social disorders. One study found that gamers aged between ten and fifteen years who played more than three hours per day were less satisfied with their lives, less likely to feel empathy toward other people, and less likely to know how to deal with their emotions appropriately. Three hours may sound like a lot, but recent surveys have shown that kids spend an average of five to seven hours in front of screens each day. When today’s Millennials become adults, there’s a fair chance their social cucumber brains will be pickled.
