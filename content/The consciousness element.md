When all other elements have been viewed through [the three characteristics](The%20three%20characteristics.md), there remaines the concsiousness element, which is one of the additional two of [the great elements](The%20great%20elements.md). The consciousness element is used to cognize [feeling](Feeling.md) and the arising and passing of [sense impression](Sense%20impression.md)s which these [feeling](Feeling.md)s are dependent.
