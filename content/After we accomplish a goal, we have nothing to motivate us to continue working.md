## After we accomplish a goal, we have nothing to motivate us to continue working

One reason to [focus on systems instead of goals](Focus%20on%20systems%20instead%20of%20goals.md) is that goal-oriented mind-set can create a ‚Äúyo-yo‚Äù effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old [habit](Habit.md)s after accomplishing a goal. The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It‚Äôs not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.
