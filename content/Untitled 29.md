## Heading

* But let me make it perfectly clear that in no way is suffering necessary to find meaning. I only insist that meaning is possible even in spite of suffering—provided, certainly, that the suffering is unavoidable. If it were avoidable, however, the meaningful thing to do would be to remove its cause, be it psychological, biological or political. To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.
* The goal is not to find more stress (we all have plenty of that!), but to use our existing stress as a navigation tool, but to use our existing stress as a navigation tool.
