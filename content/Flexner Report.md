## Flexner Report  # 

[[Abraham Flexner was assigned to direct John D. Rockefellers restructering of American medical school]]. Never mind that [[Abraham Flexner|Abraham]] himself knew nothing about medicine‚Äîafter all, physicians were the problem, right? To bone up, he spent two years evaluating the organizational structure of several European medical schools, including those in England, France, and Germany. In 1910, he published his Flexner Report, which decried the state of American medical education for lack of evidence-based medicine (the same cry we hear today, by the way), and advocated for far-reaching reform in the training of doctors. 

[[Abraham Flexner|Abraham]] doubted the scientific validity of all forms of medicine other than those based on research; everything else was quackery and charlatanism. To be fair, much of it was. Medical schools had to drop electromagnetic field therapy, phototherapy, physiomedicalism, naturopathy, homeopathy, and several other questionable practices. And, most important, nutrition was drop as well. Neither Flexner brother ever embraced the concept of diet or nutrition as part of the new medical curriculum because there was no money to be made in it.

Eighty percent of medical colleges nationally were forced to shutter for either not meeting standards or not overhauling their curricula. The [[osteopathy|osteopathic]] and chiropractic schools were directly in the crosshairs, and while they protested, there wasn‚Äôt much that could be done. The fix was in. Although almost all the alternative medical schools listed in Flexner‚Äôs report were closed, the International Association of Chiropractic Schools and Colleges (IACSC) was formed, with nineteen member colleges. The American [[osteopathy|Osteopathic]] Association (AOA) also brought a number of [[osteopathy|osteopathic]] medical schools into compliance with Flexner‚Äôs recommendations to produce an evidence-based practice. The curricula of DO- and MD-granting medical schools are now nearly identical, except that [[osteopathy|osteopathic]] schools still teach [[osteopathy|osteopathic]] manipulative medicine (OMM).

[[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]], Pritchett, and the AMA presented the Flexner Report to Congress in 1911, which adopted it without change. Since then, it‚Äôs never been updated. The report aligned well with Flexner‚Äôs strategy, the AMA‚Äôs strategy, Johns Hopkins‚Äôs striving for preeminence among major American medical schools, and the quest for new drugs that could advance the nascent pharmaceutical industry‚Äôs (and Rockefeller‚Äôs) objectives.
