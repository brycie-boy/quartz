## Idolatry  #🧠 

[[Language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]], and [[because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential]]. Idolatry refers to when our [[reality tunnel]] becomes a [[subjective bias]] to the point where the metaphorical or inferential nature of models is either forgotten or repressed. It is the stage of innocence or arrogance in which the [[the fifth stage of perception]], that is, somebody's edited and final version of perception, or their [[Emic Reality]], is confused with the [[The first stage of perception|first stage]], the energy-event or [[Etic Reality]] "out there."

[[The kind of attention we pay to an object changes whatever that thing is to us]]. The idolator, however, believes they see things objectively. To the idolater things or events "really are" what they appear to be as coded in there favorite [[reality tunnel]]. Any other [[reality tunnel]], however useful it may appear to others in different contexts, must then be either delusory or fraudulent. Anybody who disagrees with the idolater must be, by definition, a loony or a liar. This is the mentality that underlies all inquisitions.
