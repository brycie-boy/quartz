## Eugenics provided the wealthy with a explanation to and solution for the influx of immigrants filling U.S. asylums in the late 1800s  # 

[[The eugenics movement first took hold in the United States in the late 1800s when immigration began to increase and immigrants filled asylums]]. To the affluent, [[eugenics]] offered an explanation for what had gone wrong and a solution to the problem. In nature, the clutch of patients in the state mental asylums—along with the mentally handicapped and other misfits—would have been swiftly eliminated. But American society, with its asylums, poorhouses, and other charitable services for the weak, had—just like England—gone against nature and supported a “bad-seed” strain of humans. Any society that wanted to remain strong would do well to avoid spending on its “defectives” and would seek to keep them from breeding as well. 

When [[Andrew Carnegie]] read the writings of English [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Herbert Spencer]], who railed against social programs for the unfit, the light bulb went on for him. It was, he said, as though he had finally “found the truth of evolution.” As early as 1891, American feminist [[Victoria Woodhull]], in her book The Rapid Multiplication of the Unfit, argued that the “best minds” of the day agreed that “imbeciles, criminals, paupers and [the] otherwise unfit ... must not be bred.” For that to occur, the unfit would have to be prohibited from marrying, segregated into asylums, and forcibly sterilized. However, that was an agenda at radical odds with democratic principles, but [[eugenics had dismissed the democratic ideal that all people are of equal value]]. It could only be seriously advanced if wrapped in the gauze of “neutral” science, but [[what the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]].
