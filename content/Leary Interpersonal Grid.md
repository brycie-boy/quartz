## Leary Interpersonal Grid  # 

[[The four quadrants]] are not meant to be rigid or to imply that there are only four types of humanoid robots. Other circuits modify this considerably: some [[imprint]]s are wobbly (cover two or more quadrants partly); and we are all capable of sudden brain change. It is also important to realize that the four archetypes are for convenience only. Each quadrant can be subdivided much more sharply, if necessary for diagnostic purposes.

For instance, an influential psychological test in this country, the Leary Interpersonal Grid (1957), divides the four quadrants into sixteen sub-quadrants and allows one to grade each in terms of moderate-to-excessive tendency to behave that way. In the grid on which the Leary categories are drawn, the moderate imprints are in toward the center and the excessive or extreme cases are out toward the perimeter, but what is being measured is still basically the way the first two circuits (oral-bio-survival and anal-territorial) are imprinted.
