## Echo chamber

Echo chambers refer to situations in which a social [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) is amplified or [reinforced](Operant%20conditioning.md) by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal. By participating in an echo chamber, people are able to seek out information that [reinforces](Operant%20conditioning.md) their existing views without encountering opposing views, potentially resulting in an unconscious exercise in [confirmation bias](Confirmation%20bias.md).
