Echo chambers refer to situations in which a [[Fundamentalism]] is amplified and [[operant conditioning|reinforced]] by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal. By participating in an echo chamber, people are able to seek out information that [[operant conditioning|reinforces]] their existing views without encountering opposing views, potentially resulting in an unconscious exercise in [[confirmation bias]].
