## Conditioning  #‚è≥

Conditioning is a theory that the reaction to an object or event by a person or animal can be modified by reinforcement. All conditioning is built on top of [Imprint](Imprint.md)s. They are looser and fairly easy to change with counter-conditioning. The most well-known form of this is [Ivan Pavlov]()'s¬†[Classical Conditioning](Classical%20conditioning.md), and [B.F. Skinner]() built on it to produce¬†[operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md).
