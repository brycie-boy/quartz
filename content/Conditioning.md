## Conditioning  #⏳

Conditioning is a theory that the reaction to an object or event by a person or animal can be modified by reinforcement. All conditioning is built on top of [[Imprint]]s. They are looser and fairly easy to change with counter-conditioning. The most well-known form of this is [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s [[Classical Conditioning]], and [[B.F. Skinner]] built on it to produce [[operant conditioning]].
