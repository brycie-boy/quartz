## The Rationalist is typically perplexed and adversed toward Neurosomatic Circuit functions

The robotized [Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md) Rationalist fears and resents [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) rapture and its holistic intuitive faculties (just as the robotized [Emotional-Territorial Circuit](Emotional-Territorial%20Circuit.md) Emotionalist fears and resents [Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md) reason). Thus, when the [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) feedback begins to function, and the mutated [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) person tries to describe his or her rapture and at-oneness, the Rationalist hastily mutters that this is “merely subjective.” Misery is “merely subjective,” too, but that doesn’t keep it from hurting. The neurosomatic skill of transmuting all experience, so that one is high and happy in a situation where the [four-circuited](The%20eight%20circuits%20of%20consciousness.md) majority would be miserable, is worth learning for the very simple, egotistic reason that it’s more fun to be happy than to be in agony. It is also socially beneficial, because, as [Timothy Leary]() often said, “You can’t do good until you feel good.” Just as misery loves company, the high and happy want everybody else to be high and happy. (The first lesson the [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) adept has to learn is to control this upsurge of altruism and not make a nuisance of oneself by trying to force everybody to be happy . . .)

The Rationalist is even more alarmed by the results of prolonged [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) bliss, which includes the ability to heal a wide variety of diseases both in oneself and in others. This is because [long-term exposure to large doses of cortisol is linked to increased suseptability to disease and death](Long-term%20exposure%20to%20large%20doses%20of%20cortisol%20is%20linked%20to%20increased%20suseptability%20to%20disease%20and%20death.md). But do to Cartesian mind/body dualism, It all sounds “metaphysical” and therefore it cannot exist.

There is nothing supernatural about the [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md). It merely appears “supernatural” by comparison to the earlier circuits; but the [Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md), of which the Rationalist is so proud, undoubtedly appeared “supernatural” when it first appeared. (The Egyptians attributed speech and writing, third-circuit functions, to divine intervention by the god Thoth.) The [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md), like the earlier circuits, is just another evolutionary mutation, necessary to us as we move toward a more complex neuro-social level.
