## The left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context

[The right hemisphere sees things in their context](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20things%20in%20their%20context.md), but the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), because its thinking is decontextualised, tends towards a slavish following of the internal logic of the situation, even if it runs completely contrary of everything experience tells us. This can be a strength, for example in philosophy, when it gets us beyond intuition, although it could also be seen as the disease for which philosophy itself must be the cure; but it is a weakness when it permits too ready a capitulation to theory. However, [the experienced world transcends the deterministic views of the fundamentalist](The%20experienced%20world%20transcends%20the%20deterministic%20views%20of%20the%20fundamentalist.md).

The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is the hemisphere of abstraction, which, as the word itself tells us, is the process of wresting things from their context. This, and its related capacity to categorize things once they have been abstracted, are the foundations of its intellectual power. In one study, a patient with [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) damage, therefore relying on his [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) only, on being asked to copy a model using pieces of wood appeared as if "compelled by some bizarre force" "to place the pieces of wood on top of the model that intended of them to copy, rather than to one side‚Äô. This was thought to signify a problem with the ability to produce an abstract representation from a concrete model. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) can only re-present; but the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), for its part, can only give again what ‚Äòpresences‚Äô. 

Another patient had lost the power of expression in speech, but retained some automatic understanding of the names of objects, which was presumed to be mediated by their [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md). Although they could instantly pick up a brick on command, they could have no ‚Äòmemory‚Äô of the word brick.
