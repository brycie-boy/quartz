## The brains of seasoned meditators have been shown stronger connectivity between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex # 

In one study, the [[brain]]s of meditators were scanned while they saw disturbing images of people suffering, like burn victims. The seasoned practitioners‚Äô brains revealed a lowered level of reactivity in the [[amygdala]]; they were more immune to emotional hijacking. The reason: their brains had stronger operative connectivity between the [[prefrontal cortex]] and the [[amygdala]], and [[the strength of the connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex determines a person‚Äôs level of emotional reactivity]]. When these high-lifetime-hour meditators saw an image of a gruesome-looking burn victim, they had little [[amygdala]] reactivity. Age-matched volunteers did not show either the heightened connectivity or the [[equanimity]] on viewing the disturbing images.

While [[mindfulness]] training did reduce the reactivity of the [[amygdala]], the long-term meditator group showed both this reduced reactivity in the [[amygdala]] plus strengthening of the connection between the [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[amygdala]]. This pattern implies that when the going gets tough‚Äîfor example, in response to a major life challenge such as losing a job‚Äîthe ability to manage distress will be greater in long-term meditators. 

Among those who show the most short-lived [[amygdala]] response, emotions come and go, adaptive and appropriate. This idea to the test with [[brain]] scans of 31 highly seasoned meditators (lifetime average was 8,800 hours of meditation practice, ranging from just 1,200 to more than 30,000). They saw the usual pictures ranging from people in extreme suffering (burn victims) to cute bunnies. On first analysis of the expert meditators‚Äô [[amygdala|amygdalae]], there was no difference in how they reacted from the responses of matched volunteers who had never meditated. But when the group divided the seasoned meditators into those with the least hours of practice (lifetime average 1,849 hours) and the most (lifetime average 7,118), the results showed that the more hours of practice, the more quickly the [[amygdala]] recovered from distress. This rapid recovery is the hallmark of resilience.
