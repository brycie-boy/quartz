## People become hypnotized by their views to avoid having to deal with existential doubt and uncertainty

[The finite models of the universe that we cling to lead us to discard the infinity of existential reality](The%20finite%20models%20of%20the%20universe%20that%20we%20cling%20to%20lead%20us%20to%20discard%20the%20infinity%20of%20existential%20reality.md). The reason why it is usually so easy for human beings to become hypnotized by their [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md)s is because we have a kind of consciousness that easily drifts into certainty and dogma rather than having to deal with existential muddle or doubt, as it brings us [cognitive dissonance](Cognitive%20dissonance.md). We slip into such certainties all the time, but especially when existential concerns are stressful: [we only rush to certitude when time pressure or prejudice is involved](We%20only%20rush%20to%20certitude%20when%20time%20pressure%20or%20prejudice%20is%20involved.md). Every "real" universe is easy to understand because it is much simpler than the existential continuum. Being hypnotized by our [Emic Reality](Emic%20Reality.md), we become more and more detached from the existential continuum, and are annoyed when it interferes with us. 

"Real" universes make us puny, however, because they are governed by absolute laws and we are small compared to them since [the more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world](The%20more%20certain%20of%20our%20views%20we%20become,%20the%20more%20we%20perceive%20ourselves%20to%20be%20victims%20of%20an%20impersonal%20world.md). This is especially true of the [Fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md) [Materialists](Materialism.md) "real" universe, and explains the helplessness and apathy of modern society. Since [The Right Man](The%20Right%20Man.md)s criminal mentality derives from such hypnosis by a "real" universe, the criminal becomes more and more the typical person of our age. When the "real" universe becomes politicized‚Äîwhen the hypnotic model becomes based on "us"-vs-"them" Aristotelian logic‚Äîthe criminal graduates into the Terrorist, another increasingly typical product of modern society.
