## ADHD runs in families because of the parents own stress impacting their children, rather than through pure genetics # 

Studies do show that if parents or siblings have [[ADHD]], a child in that family will have a greatly increased statistical risk for having [[ADHD]] as well. [[ADHD]] is also found more commonly in people whose first-degree relatives are alcoholics or suffer from [[depression]], [[anxiety]], [[addiction]], [[OCD]] or [[Tourette‚Äôs syndrome]]. It may appear from such facts that this motley collection of related syndromes is largely hereditary‚Äîbut to assume that would be like believing that if there are three generations of butchers or bakers or candlestick makers in a family, then meat cutting, baking and candle manufacturing must also be [[gene]]tic. 

The family atmosphere in which the child spends the early formative years has a major impact on [[brain]] development. [[The brains of babies mimic the emotional conditions of their caregivers]]. [[The quality of the relationships with childhood caregivers determines the capacity for a healthy stress-response]]. It is obvious that [[brain]]/mind problems such as [[ADHD]] are far more likely to develop in families where the parents are struggling with dysfunction or psychological problems of their own. It would be astonishing if children growing up in such unsettled environments did not develop some of the same problems. No [[gene]]s need be involved at all for these conditions to run in families.
