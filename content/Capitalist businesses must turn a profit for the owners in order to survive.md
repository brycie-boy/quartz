## Capitalist businesses must turn a profit for the owners in order to survive

In order for [capitalist](Capitalism.md) institutions to survive they have to turn a profit for the [bourgeoisie](Bourgeoisie.md) who own them, otherwise they'll be forced out of business by more ruthless competitors. This is carried out in two principle ways:

* [Businesses seek to form monopolies so they can increase profits by maximizing prices](Businesses%20seek%20to%20form%20monopolies%20so%20they%20can%20increase%20profits%20by%20maximizing%20prices.md)
* [Businesses seek to pay workers as little as possible increase profits](Businesses%20seek%20to%20pay%20workers%20as%20little%20as%20possible%20increase%20profits.md)
