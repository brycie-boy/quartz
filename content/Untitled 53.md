## Heading

The purveyors of hedonic behaviors, devices, and consumables are all looking for that winning formula to provide the public with some form of product (requiring continued purchase), along with an inherent hook that will maintain or even increase consumption and in which the market never reaches saturation to allow for continued expansion. Marketing genius [Nir Eyal]() provides a window into the hedonic platform used by companies to hook us and keep us coming back for more. According to [Eyal](), every successful product consists of four intertwined concepts that drive an unending vicious cycle.

1. The trigger.
1. The behavior, which soothes the trigger, is easy to perform, does not require thinking, and can be accomplished in mixed company.
1. [Variable reward](Variable%20reward.md).
1. The culmination is investment, which is really the only thing that drives company sales. We internally rationalize why we needed this reward in the first place (even though the reward was variable, and even though we had previously lived just fine without it), and that the cost of the product becomes well worth the new habit because we can now soothe the market-generated itch in a culturally acceptable manner.
