## Autoreceptor  #🧠 

An autoreceptor is a type of [[receptor]] in [[neuron]]s that monitor the level of a [[neurotransmitter]] in the [[synapse]]. These [[receptor]]s normally serve as a feedback loop that regulates how frequently that [[neuron]] fires. If [[neurotransmitter]] levels are too low, autoreceptors scream “turn on the [[neurotransmitter]] machine!” If they're too high, they scream “turn it off!” It’s like the servo-mechanism on the thermostat in your house. When the temperature drops, the thermostat kicks the heat on, and when it gets too hot, the furnace turns off. Autoreceptors serve as the [[neuron]]’s thermostat, causing it to fire relatively slowly and rhythmically and silencing it before it gets into trouble. By preventing these [[neuron]]s from firing too rapidly, these autoreceptors make sure our [[neuron]]s don’t wear out.
