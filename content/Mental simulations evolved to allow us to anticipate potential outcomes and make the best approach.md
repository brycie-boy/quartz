## Mental simulations evolved to allow us to anticipate potential outcomes and make the best approach  # 

For our ancestors, running mental simulations in the [[default mode network]] of past or future events promoted survival by enabling our ancestors to anticipate potential outcomes‚Äîin order to pick the best approach‚Äîso that we can make better decisions when there are multiple variables at play and to ready potential sensory-motor sequences for immediate action. It also strengthened the learning of successful behaviors by repeating their neural firing patterns because [[synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened through life experiences and frequency of use]].
