## Meta-programming # 

[[Our left hemisphere unconsciously focuses on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]]. The [[left hemisphere]] is much like a self-programming computer. It chooses‚Äîusually unconsciously and mechanically ([[we generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs]])‚Äîthe quality of [[consciousness]] and the [[reality tunnel]] it will employ in order to orchestrate the incoming signals of the experienced world. When the [[brain]] becomes conscious of this unconscious programming, Its creativity becomes truly astounding and is called meta-programming by Dr. [[John Lilly]]. 

Our [[right hemisphere]], by contrast, has broad, global, and flexible attention ([[The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention]]). In meta-programming, the [[right hemisphere]] becomes capable of deliberately expanding our window of attention and increasing the number of signals consciously apprehended. 

- When metaprogrammer awakes, you begin to perceive and create infinite realities where before there was only one static [[habit]]ual ‚Äúreality‚Äù in which you were trapped

One looks casually, in the ordinary way, and then looks again and again. Dull objects and boring situations become transformed‚Äîpartly because they were dull and boring only when the [[left hemisphere]] was working on its old mechanical programs‚Äîand the [[Synergy|synergetic]] unity of observer and observation becomes a thrilling experience. Every experience becomes the type of intense learning that usually only occurs in school when cramming for exams. 

Since in the existential world of experience we have to make bets ([[Each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty]]) and choices ([[The experienced world transcends the deterministic views of the fundamentalist]]), we are consciously "cramming" all the time, but there is no special sense of stress or anxiety involved, we are living time instead of passing time.
