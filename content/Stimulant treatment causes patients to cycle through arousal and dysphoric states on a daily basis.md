## Stimulant treatment causes patients to cycle through arousal and dysphoric states on a daily basis # 

[[Juvenile bipolar disorder first arose in tandem with stimulant and antidepressant treatment in children]], and  [[there are many reports of children experiencing psychosis during stimulant treatment for ADHD]]. Yet there is an even bigger problem with [[stimulant]]s. They cause children to cycle through arousal and dysphoric states on a daily basis. When a child takes the drug, [[dopamine]] levels in the [[synapse]] increase, and this produces an aroused state. The child may show increased energy, an intensified focus, and hyperalertness. The child may become anxious, irritable, aggressive, hostile, and unable to sleep. More extreme arousal symptoms include [[OCD|obsessive-compulsive]] and [[hypomania|hypomanic]] behaviors. But when the drug exits the [[brain]], [[dopamine]] levels in the [[synapse]] sharply drop, and this may lead to such dysphoric symptoms as fatigue, lethargy, apathy, social withdrawal, and [[depression]]. 

Parents regularly talk of this daily ‚Äúcrash.‚Äù But‚Äîand this is the key‚Äîsuch arousal and dysphoric symptoms are the very symptoms that the National Institute of Mental Health identifies as characteristic of a [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] child. Symptoms of [[mania]] in children, the [[NIMH]] says, include increased energy, intensified goal-directed activity, insomnia, irritability, agitation, and destructive out bursts. Symptoms of [[depression]] in children include loss of energy, social isolation, a loss of interest in activities (apathy), and a sad mood.
