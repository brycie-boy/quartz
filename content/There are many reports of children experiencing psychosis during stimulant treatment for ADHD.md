## There are many reports of children experiencing psychosis during stimulant treatment for ADHD # 

[[Amphetamines are known to induce psychotic and manic episodes]]. Given this understanding of [[Ritalin]], psychiatry could expect that giving it to young children would cause many to suffer a [[mania|manic]] or [[psychosis|psychotic]] episode as well. Although this risk isn‚Äôt well quantified, Canadian psychiatrists reported in 1999 that nine of ninety-six [[ADHD]] children they treated with [[stimulant]]s for an average of twenty-one months developed ‚Äú[[psychosis|psychotic]] symptoms.‚Äù In 2006, the [[FDA]] issued a report on this risk. From 2000 to 2005, the agency had received nearly one thousand reports of [[stimulant]]-induced [[psychosis]] and [[mania]] in children and adolescents, and given that these MedWatch reports are thought to represent only 1 percent of the actual number of adverse events, this suggests that 100,000 youths diagnosed with [[ADHD]] suffered [[psychosis|psychotic]] and or [[mania|manic]] episodes during that five-year period. The [[FDA]] determined that these episodes regularly occurred in ‚Äúpatients with no identifiable risk factors‚Äù for [[psychosis]], meaning that they were clearly drug-induced, and that a ‚Äúsubstantial portion‚Äù of the cases occurred in children ten years or less. ‚ÄúThe predominance in young children of hallucinations, both visual and tactile, involving insects, snakes and worms is striking,‚Äù the [[FDA]] wrote.
