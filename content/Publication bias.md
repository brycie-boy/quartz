## Publication bias

In published academic research, publication bias occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study biases the decision to publish or otherwise distribute it. Publishing only results that show a significant finding disturbs the balance of findings in favor of positive results. I believe it to be a prime example of [confirmation bias](Confirmation%20bias.md) and the fact that [when we mistake our models with reality itself, we stifle our capacity to learn new ideas](When%20we%20mistake%20our%20models%20with%20reality%20itself,%20we%20stifle%20our%20capacity%20to%20learn%20new%20ideas.md).
