## Publication bias # 

In published academic research, publication bias occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study biases the decision to publish or otherwise distribute it. Publishing only results that show a significant finding disturbs the balance of findings in favor of positive results. I believe it to be a prime example of [[confirmation bias]] and the fact that [[when we mistake our models with reality itself, we stifle our capacity to learn new ideas]].
