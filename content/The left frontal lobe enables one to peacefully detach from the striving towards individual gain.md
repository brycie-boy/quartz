## The left frontal lobe enables one to peacefully detach from the striving towards individual gain

[The frontal lobes for each hemisphere only negate the posterior regions rather than resist, enabling something new to arise](The%20frontal%20lobes%20for%20each%20hemisphere%20only%20negate%20the%20posterior%20regions%20rather%20than%20resist,%20enabling%20something%20new%20to%20arise.md). To take an example from the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md). The relative detachment from the body displayed by the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) ([The right hemisphere sees the body as something we live, while the for the left it is devitalized](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20the%20body%20as%20something%20we%20live,%20while%20the%20for%20the%20left%20it%20is%20devitalized.md)), and its tendency to abstraction ([The left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20understand%20things%20as%20logical,%20abstract,%20and%20stripped%20of%20context.md)), normally serve its purposeful striving towards individual gain. The left [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md), however, brings distance, and allows the experience of the peaceful detachment from the material realm and ‘emptying out’ described by experts in meditation as a [mystical experience](). Again this is no negation, but an elaboration, of what the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) affords. There is not likely to be ‘a God spot’ in the [brain](Brain.md), and the area is fraught with problems of terminology and methodology: but there are areas that are often implicated as accompaniments of religious experience.

An appropriately cautious and objective review of the literature to date by [Michael Trimble]() concludes that there is a slow accumulation of evidence in favor of religious experience being more closely linked with the ‘non-dominant’ hemisphere, especially the posterior [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) (temporoparietal region). But, to illustrate my point, the other region that is implicated lies in the left [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md)—specifically because of its power to inhibit the posterior [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) (temporoparietal region), the seat of language and of sequential analysis.
