Wokescolding, in my mind, means when you chastise somebody for not being woke enough

4:49
The wokescold i envision in my head is somebody more interested in demonstrating that they are morally superior to others than they are in actually meaningfully advancing progressive politics

10:56
In leftist spaces there is a horrid tendency, a very common tendency, for people to base their identities around the extent to which they can demonstrate a greater level of wokeness than the people around them

12:27
nobody really liked me, nobody wanted to talk to me, so i had to find a way to gain social capital

16:03
That process, gaining social capital by like proving how woke you are. It's a horrible, myopic, toxic, cannibalistic process

20:33
Its competitive by nature. You compete with others who's the wokest. Who has the greatest degree of performative leftist what have you 

20:59
leftists treat each other really shittily, _really_ shittily, because they're trying to prove to one another how woke and lefty they are
