## Under capitalism, even the well-being of highpayed workers is volatile and insecure

[The productive force of labour increased by capitalism must be seized by the workers to ensure well-being for all](The%20productive%20force%20of%20labour%20increased%20by%20capitalism%20must%20be%20seized%20by%20the%20workers%20to%20ensure%20well-being%20for%20all.md), but [capitalist](Capitalism.md) economists will not fail to remind us of the comparative well-being of a certain category of workers paticulary skilled in certain special branches of industry which has been obtained under the present system. But even the well-being of this few even secure? Perhaps tomorrow, negligence, improvidence, or the greed of their employers, will deprive this privileged minority of their work, and they will pay for the period of comfort they have enjoyed with months and years of poverty or destitution. How many important industries have we not seen decline or come to a standstill on account of speculations, or in consequence of natural displacement of work, or from the effects of competition among the capitalists themselves?
