The differentiating function is one of [[Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school]]. It states that once their social role has been “diagnosed,” children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far as their destination in the social machine merits—and not one step further [[The poor child-rearing in societies are necessary to create people who fit the standard roles of traditional society]]. [[The numbering, grading, and ordering of students conditions them to tacitly accept their hierachical position]].
