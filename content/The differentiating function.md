## The differentiating function

The differentiating function is one of [Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school](Alexander%20Inglis%20six%20basic%20functions%20of%20school.md). It states that once their social role has been “diagnosed,” children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far as their destination in the social machine merits—and not one step further. So much for making kids their personal best. [The numbering, grading, and ordering of students conditions them to tacitly accept their hierachical position](The%20numbering,%20grading,%20and%20ordering%20of%20students%20conditions%20them%20to%20tacitly%20accept%20their%20hierachical%20position.md) contributes to the differentiating function.
