## The bad gut bacteria produced from a poor diet can induce depression symptoms  # 

Food changes the types of bacteria present in your [[gut microbiome]]. Your [[gut bacteria]] may become less diverse as a result of your diet, which may cause the bad bacteria to outgrow the good bacteria, triggering a cascade of negative health effects. Food can also influence the chemical messages these bacteria send from your [[gut]] up to your [[brain]] along the [[vagus nerve]]‚Äîsignals that can make you feel either depressed and drained or uplifted and energized.

Animal research first led scientists to theorize that people who are [[Depression|depressed]] have different populations of [[gut bacteria]] than those who are not [[Depression|depressed]]. For instance, in mice, when the [[brain]]‚Äôs main center for smell is surgically removed, the mice exhibit [[depression]]-like behavior. These changes were accompanied by alterations in [[gut bacteria]]. In other words, inducing [[depression]] in mice changes their [[gut]] activity and bacteria. 

Studies in humans appear to confirm this hypothesis. In 2019, psychiatrist [[Stephanie Cheung]] and her colleagues summarized findings from six studies that looked at gut health in patients with [[depression]]. They reported that patients with [[depression]] had at least fifty types of bacterial species in their [[gut microbiome]] that were different from those of control subjects without [[depression]]. Recent research suggests that bacterial species associated with higher quality-of-life indicators are depleted in [[Depression|depressed]] subjects, while bacteria that cause [[inflammation]] are often found in higher numbers in people suffering from [[depression]].
