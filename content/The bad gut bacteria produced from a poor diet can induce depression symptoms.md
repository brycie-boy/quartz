## The bad gut bacteria produced from a poor diet can induce depression symptoms

Food changes the types of bacteria present in your [gut microbiome](). Your [gut bacteria]() may become less diverse as a result of your diet, which may cause the bad bacteria to outgrow the good bacteria, triggering a cascade of negative health effects. Food can also influence the chemical messages these bacteria send from your [gut]() up to your [brain](Brain.md) along the [vagus nerve]()‚Äîsignals that can make you feel either depressed and drained or uplifted and energized.

Animal research first led scientists to theorize that people who are [depressed](Depression.md) have different populations of [gut bacteria]() than those who are not [depressed](Depression.md). For instance, in mice, when the [brain](Brain.md)‚Äôs main center for smell is surgically removed, the mice exhibit [depression](Depression.md)-like behavior. These changes were accompanied by alterations in [gut bacteria](). In other words, inducing [depression](Depression.md) in mice changes their [gut]() activity and bacteria. 

Studies in humans appear to confirm this hypothesis. In 2019, psychiatrist [Stephanie Cheung]() and her colleagues summarized findings from six studies that looked at gut health in patients with [depression](Depression.md). They reported that patients with [depression](Depression.md) had at least fifty types of bacterial species in their [gut microbiome]() that were different from those of control subjects without [depression](Depression.md). Recent research suggests that bacterial species associated with higher quality-of-life indicators are depleted in [depressed](Depression.md) subjects, while bacteria that cause [inflammation]() are often found in higher numbers in people suffering from [depression](Depression.md).
