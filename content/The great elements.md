## The great elements  #‚è≥

The great elements, rather than representing mere atomic substances, instead represent behavioral aspects or qualities of matter. The four main elements include:

* [the earth element](The%20earth%20element.md)
* [the water element](The%20water%20element.md)
* [the fire element](The%20fire%20element.md)
* [the air element](The%20air%20element.md)

The four main elements are inseparably linked in any unit of matter, from the smallest to the largest and most complex. 

The four main elements are not just properties of the external world, however, but also ones own body. Thus one must comptemplate them in relation to ones own body, as is done through the [attention to the great elements](Attention%20to%20the%20great%20elements.md) exersize. The elements can be viewed through [the three characteristics](The%20three%20characteristics.md) , [the three standpoints](The%20three%20standpoints.md), and the four truth pattern; the element itself, its origin, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation.

There are also two additional elements occasionally mentioned in [The Nikayas]() which comprise the "six great elements". These are:

* [The space element](The%20space%20element.md)
* [The consciousness element](The%20consciousness%20element.md)
