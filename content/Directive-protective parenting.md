## Directive-protective parenting

* [Narcissistic personality disorder](Narcissistic%20personality%20disorder.md)

* Do what ever they can to remove all obsitcles
* Directive-protective parents rely on no consequences
* These parents may engage in [Enabling](Enabling.md) to avoid hurting them

Directive-protective parents do not limit children‚Äôs freedom in order to force them to labor in fields or factories, or to make them servile, as [directive-domineering parenting](Directive-domineering%20parenting.md) does. Rather, they limit freedom because they fear for their children‚Äôs safety and futures and believe they can make better decisions for them than the children can for themselves. With all good intentions, directive-protective parents deprive their children of freedom at least as much as did the directive-domineering parents of the past. Directive-protective parents don‚Äôt beat their children, but use all of the other powers they have as providers to control their children‚Äôs lives. While [trustful parents](Trustful%20parenting.md) view children as resilient and competent, directive-protective parents view them as fragile and incompetent. While trustful parents believe that children develop best when allowed to play and explore on their own, directive-protective parents believe that children develop best when they follow a path carefully laid out for them by adults.
