## Meaning must be found in the outside world rather than being created in ones own mind # 

[[Meaning to ones life can change between people and situations and each has their own responsibilities]]. By declaring that people are responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of their lives, It must be stressed that the true meaning of ones life is to be discovered in the world rather than within ones own psyche, as though it were a closed system. [[Viktor Frankl]] calls this constitutive characteristic ‚Äúthe self-transcendence of human existence.‚Äù It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself‚Äîbe it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets themselves‚Äîby giving themselves to a cause to serve or another person to love‚Äîthe more human they are and the more they actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, [[self-actualization]] is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.
