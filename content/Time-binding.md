## Time-binding

Time-binding is a concept refering to the passing of signals from generation to generation, which allows each generation to add new categories to our mental library‚Äîconnecting new things, separating new things, reclassifying and reshuffling forever. It occurs with evolution of the [Time-Binding Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md), which distinguishes us from ordinary primates.
