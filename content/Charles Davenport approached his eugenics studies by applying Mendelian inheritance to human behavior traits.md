## Charles Davenport approached his eugenics studies by applying Mendelian inheritance to human behavior traits

[At the beginning of the 1900s, Andrew Carnegie had funded Charles Davenport to establish eugenics educational programs in the U.S.](At%20the%20beginning%20of%20the%201900s,%20Andrew%20Carnegie%20had%20funded%20Charles%20Davenport%20to%20establish%20eugenics%20educational%20programs%20in%20the%20U.S..md). [Davenport]() approached his study of human inheritance with a Mendelian understanding of [gene]()tics ([Mendelian inheritance](Mendelian%20inheritance.md)), and applied this Mendelian model to complex behavioral traits in humans, each trait said to be controlled by a single [gene](). Again, [genetic theories of medical or mental conditions can enable people or society to absolve themselves from responsibility](Genetic%20theories%20of%20medical%20or%20mental%20conditions%20can%20enable%20people%20or%20society%20to%20absolve%20themselves%20from%20responsibility.md). Moreover, he was particularly intent on proving that immigrants and societal misfits were [gene]()tically inferior, and soon he was confidently writing that people could inherit [gene]()s for “nomadism,” “shiftlessness,” and “insincerity.” Immigrants from Italy, Greece, Hungary, and other Southeastern European countries had [germ plasm]() that made them “more given to crimes of larceny, kidnapping, assault, murder, rape and sex-immorality.” Jews inherited [gene]()s for “thieving” and “prostitution.”
