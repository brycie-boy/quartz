## Right hemisphere deficits may lead the left hemisphere to see people who are in different places as duplicates

Fascinatingly, [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) deficit syndromes can result in something which looks like the opposite of how [The right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20able%20to%20integrate%20individual%20aspects%20of%20things%20into%20a%20coherent%20whole%20whereas%20the%20left%20sees%20only%20separate%20entities.md), that is, the belief that an individual someone knows is duplicated in different places at different times. Not in other words the division of a unique whole, but the mass reproduction of one. Something personal and usually alive has been duplicated as if it were a mere item on an assembly line, according to John Cutting, with loss of uniqueness and familiarity.  Here the fine discrimination of individuals supplied by the right hemisphere is lost, and different individuals are lumped together and again ‚Äòre-presented‚Äô in a category. It is not the opposite of the Capgras syndrome, but a natural consequence of the same cause: a loss of the sense of a unique whole.
