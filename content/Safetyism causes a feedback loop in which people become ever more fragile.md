## Safetyism causes a feedback loop in which people become ever more fragile # 

When people live in a culture of [[safetyism]], which teaches people to stay “emotionally safe” while protecting them from every imaginable danger, it may set up a feedback loop: those people become more fragile and less resilient, which signals to others that they need more protection, which then makes them even more fragile and less resilient. The end result may be a widespread backfiring effect in which the “cure” turns out to be a primary cause of the disease.
