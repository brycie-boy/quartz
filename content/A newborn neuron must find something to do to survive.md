## A newborn neuron must find something to do to survive

[Neuron](Neuron.md)s are born as blank-slate [stem cell]()s, and they go through a development process in which they need to find something to do in order to survive. Most of them don’t. It takes about twenty-eight days for a fledgling [neuron](Neuron.md) to plug into a network. in order for a [neuron](Neuron.md) to survive and integrate, it has to fire its [axon](Axon.md). If we don’t use the newborn [neuron](Neuron.md)s, we lose them.
