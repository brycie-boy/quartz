## The overstimulation of dopamine receptors may lead to cell damage or death in the nucleus accumbens

The [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)‚Äìharboring [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) [neuron](Neuron.md)s are fragile. They want to be tickled; that‚Äôs why they have [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s in the first place. But they‚Äôre very sensitive; they don‚Äôt want to be bludgeoned. If you open the [dopamine](Dopamine.md) floodgates repeatedly, these [neuron](Neuron.md)s have some fail-safe methods built in to protect themselves. The goal is to have an optimal level of [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s so that even a minuscule [dopamine](Dopamine.md) rush can find an open [receptor](Receptor.md) and generate a unique pleasure from the experience. Obviously, a bigger rush will occupy more [receptor](Receptor.md)s and generate a bigger reward. But stimulating the [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s excites that next [neuron](Neuron.md) in the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md), and overstimulation with multiple rapid firings can cause those [receptor](Receptor.md)-containing [neuron](Neuron.md)s to go into overdrive, potentially leading to cell damage or death, termed [excitotoxicity](Excitotoxicity.md).
