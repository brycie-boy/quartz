## Capitalism forces the worker to give up much of what they produce

As a result of the [capitalist](Capitalism.md) system, the worker cannot find work without accepting to forgo a great part of what they will produce to the [bourgeois](Bourgeoisie.md). They must sell their labour for a meager and uncertain wage. If they do find work, it is on condition of surrendering a quarter of their produce to the [bourgeois](Bourgeoisie.md), and another quarter to the government or middlemen. And their tax, levied upon them by the state, the [bourgeois](Bourgeoisie.md), the landlord and the middleman, is always increasing; it rarely leaves them the power to improve their system of culture.

We condem the feudal lord who forced the peasant to work unless they surrendered to them a fourth of what they produce. We call those times barbarous. But if the forms have changed, the realtions have remained the same, and a worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. They cannot find any better conditions where ever they look, because everything has become [private property](Private%20property.md), and they must accept, or die of hunger.

The result of this state of things is that all our production tends in a wrong direction. Enterprise takes no thought for the needs of the community. Because [capitalist businesses must turn a profit for the owners in order to survive](Capitalist%20businesses%20must%20turn%20a%20profit%20for%20the%20owners%20in%20order%20to%20survive.md), its only aim is to increase profits. Hence the constant fluctuations of trade, the periodical industrial crises, each of which throws countless workers on the streets.
