## Stress is only increased in the low ranking members of a hierarchy for those that experience harrasment  # 

[[A low hierarchical rank can have different implications within different species or animal cultures]], and another critical variable to this is an animal’s personal experience of both its rank and society. For example, consider a period when an immensely aggressive male has joined a troop of baboons and is raising hell, attacking animals unprovoked left and right. One might predict [[stress-response]]s throughout the troop thanks to this destabilizing brute. But, instead, the pattern reflects the individual experience of animals—for those lucky enough never to be attacked by this character, there were no changes in [[immune system|immune function]]. In contrast, among those attacked, the more frequently that particular baboon suffered at this guy’s teeth, the more immunosuppressed they were. Thus, you ask the question, “What are the effects of an aggressive, stressful individual on [[immune system|immune function]] in a social group?” The answer is, “It depends—it’s not the abstract state of living in a stressful society which is immunosuppressive. Instead, it is the concrete state of how often your own nose is being rubbed in that instability.”
