## Mindfulness practice has been shown to decouple cues and behaviors

Research has shown that [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) decouples the link between cues and and behaviors set up by [operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md). Researchers looked specifically at the relationship between [craving](Craving.md) and smoking because [craving](Craving.md) had been clearly linked as part of the habit loop (trigger, behavior, reward). Without a craving, people were much less likely to smoke. They found that, indeed, before [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) training, [craving](Craving.md) predicted smoking. If people craved a cigarette, they were very likely to smoke one. Yet by the end of the four weeks of training, this relationship had been severed. Interestingly, people who quit reported [craving](Craving.md) cigarettes at the same level as those that didn‚Äôt quit. They just didn‚Äôt smoke when they craved.
