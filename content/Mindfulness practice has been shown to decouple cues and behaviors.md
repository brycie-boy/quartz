## Mindfulness practice has been shown to decouple cues and behaviors # 

Research by Dr. [[Judson Brewer]] and his team has shown that [[mindfulness]] decouples the link between cues and and behaviors set up by [[operant conditioning]]. They looked specifically at the relationship between [[craving]] and smoking because [[craving]] had been clearly linked as part of the [[habit]] loop (trigger, behavior, reward). Without a [[craving]], people were much less likely to smoke. They found that, indeed, before [[mindfulness]] training, [[craving]] predicted smoking. If people craved a cigarette, they were very likely to smoke one. Yet by the end of the four weeks of training, this relationship had been severed. Interestingly, people who quit reported [[craving]] cigarettes at the same level as those that didn’t quit. They just didn’t smoke when they craved.
