## The Right Man is turning off more sensory signals than is neurologically normal

If [Our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important](Our%20brains%20unconsciously%20focus%20on%20only%20a%20select%20few%20of%20the%20sensory%20signals%20it%20receives%20that%20it%20considers%20important.md), then [The Right Man](The%20Right%20Man.md) may simply be turning off more sensory signals than is neurologically normal. Specifically, they have been [Imprint](Imprint.md)ed or [conditioned](Conditioning.md), or have [conditioned](Conditioning.md) themselves, to suppress as "meaningless" or "irrelevent" the kind of signals that usually evoke compassion, charity, or tolerance in the ordinary person. In their [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md), the only signals that reach their conscious percpetion are those confirming that people are rotten bastards who need to be punished.
