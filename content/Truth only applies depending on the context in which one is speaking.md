## Truth only applies depending on the context in which one is speaking #🧠

The proposition "Water only boils at 100 degrees Celsius" would generally be considered "true" by most people. That is because most people have lived at or near sea level. Those who live at high altitudes realize that the statement needs to be modified before we can call it true. It should say "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level on this planet." Similarly, the proposition "pq equals qp" is only true, or valid, within ordinary algebra. It is not true in the equally valid algebra invented by [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. Thus, it is possible that "truth" only exists when one has already specified the context or field in which one is speaking.
