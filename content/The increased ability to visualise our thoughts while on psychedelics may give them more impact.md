## The increased ability to visualise our thoughts while on psychedelics may give them more impact

One of the things that accounts for the fact that [Psychedelics can help us get over bad habits without cognative effort by bringing us into a more mindful state](Psychedelics%20can%20help%20us%20get%20over%20bad%20habits%20without%20cognative%20effort%20by%20bringing%20us%20into%20a%20more%20mindful%20state.md) may be the connection between seeing and believing. Very often on [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s our thoughts become visible. These are not hallucinations, exactly, because the subject is often fully aware that what she is seeing is not really before her, yet these thoughts made visible are nevertheless remarkably concrete, vivid, and therefore memorable.

This is a curious phenomenon, as yet unexplained by neuroscience, though some interesting hypotheses have recently been proposed. When neuroscientists who study vision use fMRIs to image brain activity, they find that the same regions in the visual cortex light up whether one is seeing an object live‚Äî‚Äúonline‚Äù‚Äîor merely recalling or imagining it, off-line. This suggests that the ability to visualize our thoughts should be the rule rather than the exception. 

Some neuroscientists suspect that during normal waking hours something in the [brain](Brain.md) inhibits the [visual cortex]() from presenting to [consciousness](Consciousness.md) a visual image of whatever it is we‚Äôre thinking about. It‚Äôs not hard to see why such an inhibition might be adaptive: cluttering the mind with vivid images would complicate reasoning and abstract thought, not to mention everyday activities like walking or driving a car. But when we are able to visualize our thoughts‚Äîsuch as the thought of ourselves as a smoker looking like a coughing gargoyle‚Äîthose thoughts take on added weight, feel more real to us. Perhaps the equally vivid overview effect on the scenes of their lives that [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s afford some people is what makes it possible for them to change their behavior.
