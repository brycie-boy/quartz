Prebiotics are essentially food for helpful bacteria, they're certain types of [fiber]() that we cannot digest but our good [gut bacteria]() can. Prebiotic-rich foods include beans and other legumes, oats, bananas, berries, garlic, onions, dandelion greens, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, and leeks.
