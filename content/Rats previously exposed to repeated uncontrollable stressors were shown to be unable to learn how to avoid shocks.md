## Rats previously exposed to repeated uncontrollable stressors were shown to be unable to learn how to avoid shocks

Why is it that most of us can have occasional terrible experiences, feel depressed, and then recover, while a few of us collapse into major [depression](Depression.md)? Certain features dominate as psychologically stressful: a loss of control ([Lack of control predicts stress-response](Lack%20of%20control%20predicts%20stress-response.md)) and of predictability ([Lack of predictability predicts stress-response](Lack%20of%20predictability%20predicts%20stress-response.md)) within certain contexts, a loss of outlets for frustration, a loss of sources for support ([Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in primates](Having%20social%20support%20is%20shown%20to%20lower%20the%20stress-response%20in%20primates.md) [including humans](Having%20social%20support%20is%20shown%20to%20lower%20the%20stress-response%20in%20humans.md)), a perception of life worsening. 

In one style of experiment, pioneered by the psychologists [Martin Seligman]() and [Steven Maier](), animals are exposed to pathological amounts of these psychological [stressor](Stressor.md)s. The result is a condition strikingly similar to a human [depression](Depression.md). Although the actual [stressor](Stressor.md)s may differ, the general approach in these studies always emphasizes repeated [stressor](Stressor.md)s with a complete absence of control on the part of the animal. For example, a rat may be subjected to a long series of frequent, uncontrollable, and unpredictable shocks or noises, with no outlets.

After awhile, something extraordinary happens to that rat. This can be shown with a test. Take a fresh, unstressed rat, and give it something easy to learn. Put it in a room, for example, with the floor divided into two halves. Occasionally, electricity that will cause a mild shock is delivered to one half, and just beforehand, there is a signal indicating which half of the floor is about to be electrified. Your run-of-the-mill rat can learn this ‚Äúactive avoidance task‚Äù easily, and within a short time it readily and calmly shifts the side of the room it sits in according to the signal. Simple. Except for a rat who has recently been exposed to repeated uncontrollable [stressor](Stressor.md)s. That rat cannot learn the task. It does not learn to cope. On the contrary, it has learned to be helpless. This phenomenon has been dubbed "[learned helplessness](Learned%20helplessness.md)." When people believe they have little or no control over their fate, they become anxious. ‚ÄúSomething terrible can happen to me at any time and I will be unable to do anything about it.‚Äù When the anxiety and sense of helplessness become too great, people become [depressed](Depression.md). ‚ÄúThere is no use trying; I‚Äôm doomed.‚Äù
