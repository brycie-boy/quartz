## Walking for only three days a week can increase prefrontal cortex volume

* Find our how much volume increased 

The seminal 2006 study from [Arthur Kramer]() of the University of Illinois used MRI scans to show that walking as few as three days a week for six months increased the volume of the prefrontal cortex in older adults. And when he tested aspects of their executive function, they showed improvement in working memory, smoothly switching between tasks and screening out irrelevant stimuli.
