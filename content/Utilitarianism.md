## Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is a [consequentialist](Consequentialism.md) ethical theory that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for all affected individuals. Although different varieties of utilitarianism admit different characterizations, the basic idea behind all of them is, in some sense, to maximize utility, which is often defined in terms of well-being and happiness.
