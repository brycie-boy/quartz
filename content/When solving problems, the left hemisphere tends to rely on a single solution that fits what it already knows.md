## When solving problems, the left hemisphere tends to rely on a single solution that fits what it already knows

The fact that [the right hemisphere allows for flexibility in thought and behavior](The%20right%20hemisphere%20allows%20for%20flexibility%20in%20thought%20and%20behavior.md) can be seen in problem solving. The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) operates in [intelligent mode](Intelligent%20mode.md); It performs [high-temperature search](High-temperature%20search.md)es and presents an array of possible solutions, which remain live while alternatives are explored. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), by contrast, relies on [mechanic mode](Mechanic%20mode.md); [the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md) and It performs [low-temperature search](Low-temperature%20search.md)es and takes the single solution that seems best to fit what it already knows and latches onto it. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) has a tendency to ignore discrepancies that do not fit into its pre-configured system of classification. The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), by contrast, is actively watching for discrepancies, more like a devil's advocate. These approaches are both needed, but pull in opposite directions.
