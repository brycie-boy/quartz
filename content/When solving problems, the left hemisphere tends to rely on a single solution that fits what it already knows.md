## When solving problems, the left hemisphere tends to rely on a single solution that fits what it already knows # 

[[The right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior]]. This can be seen in problem solving. The [[right hemisphere]] operates in [[intelligent mode]]; It performs [[high-temperature search]]es and presents an array of possible solutions, which remain live while alternatives are explored. The [[left hemisphere]], by contrast, relies on [[Mechanical mode]]; [[the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]], performs [[low-temperature search]]es and takes the single solution that seems best to fit what it already knows and latches onto it. 

The [[left hemisphere]] has a tendency to ignore discrepancies that do not fit into its pre-established understanding. The [[right hemisphere]], by contrast, is actively watching for discrepancies, more like a devil's advocate. These approaches are both needed, but pull in opposite directions.
