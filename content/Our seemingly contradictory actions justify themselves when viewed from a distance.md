## Our seemingly contradictory actions justify themselves when viewed from a distance

With regards to consistency,¬†human¬†nature¬†has its own internal consistency, so it truly is impossible for a person to do something against their own nature, as long as that person is following their [True Will](True%20Will.md), as it is a moment-to-moment path of action that operates in perfect harmony with the Universe. Every action is justified by the whole of ones character, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the earth. Similarly, the voyage of a ship is jagged, but seen from a distance, it straightens itself in meeting its destination. Persistence in living according to one‚Äôs [True Will](True%20Will.md) will always bring a person to the right course of action. Thus [a self-reliant person should not be afraid to contradict themselves](A%20self-reliant%20person%20should%20not%20be%20afraid%20to%20contradict%20themselves.md).

We pass for what we are overall. Our character says more about us than our individual actions. People think they communicate their character only by their overt actions, and do not see that it is in every moment.Their will be overall agreement between what ever variety of actions if they are honest and natural. Being of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unalike they seem. We lose sight of this variety when we observe our selves from a short distance, but in the long run, one purpose unites each of these actions. Your genuine action will explain itself. But your [conformity](Conformity.md) will explain nothing. The impact of our character is cumulative. All of our previous actions contribute to this. It is a truth readily illustrated in the lives of people admired in the past for greatness.
