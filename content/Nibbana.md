## Nibbana  #‚è≥

Nibbana is often defined as the destruction of [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md). But Nibbana is not simply the destruction of defilements and an exhaulted feeling of psychological well-being. Nibbana is often spoken of almost as if it were a transcendent demension of being. It is referred to as a "base" beyond the world of common experience where none of [the great elements](The%20great%20elements.md) or even [the formless realms](The%20formless%20attainments.md) are present. It is beyond all [duality](), relativity, time and space. It is a realm that is completely quiesent, without arising, parishing or change, thus It is often refered to as "the unborn, unmade, unbecome, and unconditioned", the existence of which makes possible deliverance from what is born, made, come to be, and conditioned. The penetration of this base brings the destruction of defilements, culminating in complete purification of mind. Such purification involves the experience of unconditional peace and happiness. Upon physical death, it brings irriversible release from [Samsara](Samsara.md) because it is unborn, thus it is often referred to as the "deathless" or "immortality."
