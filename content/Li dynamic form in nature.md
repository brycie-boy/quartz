archetypal modes of action, the traces of w  
hich may be found throughout the natural world. They present, in a  
traditional Chinese view at least, an order that arises directly o  
ut of the nature of the universe

According to the great Sung philosopher Chu Hsi (  
1130-1200 C.E.): ?The term tao refers to the vast and great; the term /i i  
ncludes the innumerable veinlike patterns included in the Tao. . . . Li i  
s like a piece of thread with its strands, or like this basket. O  
ne strip goes this way, and the other goes that way. It is also like t  
he grain in bamboo. On the straight it is of one kind, and on t  
he transverse it is of another kind. So also the mind possesses v  
arious p

According to the early Greek philosopher Empedocles all t  
he change and movement in the universe, including all the p  
rocesses of creation and destruction, stem ultimately from two g  
reat principles of attraction and r  
epulsion. Clearly, form of any kind depends on its component parts hold- ing together, just as its ultimate dissolution is a result of f  
alling a

The /i opposite, characteristic of the tenuous, temporary a  
lliances seen on the surface of a liquid medium as particulate c  
lustering (opposite, top) or suds (opposite, bottom), have only the m  
inimal requirement for a recognizable structure. And yet form is a  
pparent here, to an extent that is not discernible in, say, the swirls of a  
n entirely liquid m

Structural formality becomes even more apparent when a  
n aggregation forms around a nucleic center, particularly where, a

Branching systems provide an elegant solution where there is a  
need to access every part of a given area in the most efficient a  
nd economical way. That is why these patterns are so widespread i  
n nature and are quite essential to the workings of complex organ- isms, where the dynamics of efficient distribution (involving ener- gy in one form or another) is at a p

20

The almost universal characteristic of these forms, whether t  
hey are conveying water, oxygen, nutrients, or just electrical impuls- es, is that they consist of a system of finer and finer r  
amifications, which is another expression of their e

By virtue of their highly regulated internal structure, cells a  
re endowed with an almost crystalline orderliness, but they are a  
lso possessed by a dynamic sense of purpose; they are f  
unctional entities, working to supply the organism with all of its n

24

The dynamic organization within cells is paralleled by t  
heir relations with their neighbors, with whom they usually coexist i  
n very close p

24

In essence, all living things are symbiotic at heart; the p  
roperties of complex organisms are an expression of the separate a  
ctivities of their component cells, and each cell lives in the s  
pecific environment created by this a

The /i of cell structures, like the vascular cambium (the a  
ctive layer of tree cells) of Juglans and Robinia (opposite and b  
elow), indicate this elegant and sensitive division of space and f

The hairline cracks in ceramics (opposite, top) occur as a result o

Leaves of all kinds are involved in the world?s single m  
ost important chemical transaction: converting the Sun?s energy i  
nto food. Their veining systems play a critical role in this p  
rocess, supplying water and mineral salts to every part of the leaf a  
nd efficiently removing the elaborate food compounds created b  
y photosynthesis. In addition, vascular systems provide a sup- porting skeleton for the leaf, so they are a proficient p  
lumbing system and superstructure combined. These are very a  
ttractive forms, in all their great variety and s

56

There are obvious similarities between these plant c  
irculatory systems and the venous and nervous systems of animals?but t  
hey are also strangely evocative of river drainage complexes. T  
he common factor in all of these processes is, as ever, the transfer o  
f energy; these delicate forms should also be seen as e  
nergy p

That complexity can arise almost of itself, and that there is a  
connectedness between every part of the self-created cosmos i  
s, of course, a central tenet of the Chinese philosophy of T  
aoism. The Tao te Ching, its principle text, affirms t

is: ?The Way (Tao) is a thing incommensurable, i  
mpalpable, Yet latent in it are forms (L
