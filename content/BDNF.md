## BDNF

BDNF helps the [brain](Brain.md) sprout new [dendrite](Dendrite.md) branches, producing the same structural growth required for learning. BDNF also binds to [receptor](Receptor.md)s at the [synapse](Synapse.md), unleashing the flow of ions to increase the voltage and immediately improve the signal strength. Inside the cell, BDNF activates [gene]()s that call for the production of more BDNF as well as [serotonin](Serotonin.md) and [protein]()s that build up the [synapse](Synapse.md)s. Overall, it improves the function of [neuron](Neuron.md)s, encourages their growth, and strengthens and protects them against the natural process of [cell]() death.
