## Attention to the unattractive nature of the body  #⏳

Attention to the unattractive nature of the body is an exercise of the [contemplation of body](Contemplation%20of%20body.md). [The Buddha]() explains the exercise as follows: 

 > 
 > a monk reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair, bounded by skin, as full of many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this body there are head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine.’
