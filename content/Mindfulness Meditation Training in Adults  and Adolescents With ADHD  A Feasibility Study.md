M ethod:Twenty-four adults and eight adolescents with ADHD  
enrolled in a feasibility study of an 8-week mindfulness training program. R esults:T  
he majority of participants completedthe training and reported high satisfaction with the training. Pre‚Äìpost improvements in self-reported ADHD symptoms and  
test performance on tasks measuring attention and cognitive inhibition were noted. Improvements in anxiety and depressive  
symptoms were also observed. C onclusion:Mindfulness training is a feasible intervention in a subset of ADHD adults and  
adolescents and may improve behavioral and neurocognitive impairments. A controlled clinical study is warranted.

The primary practice (sitting or  
walking meditation) involves three steps: (a) bringing  
attention to an ‚Äúattentional anchor‚Äù (usually a sensory  
input such as breath), (b) noting that distraction occurs  
and letting go of the distraction, and (c) refocusing or  
reorienting attention back to the ‚Äúattentional anchor.‚Äù  
This sequence is repeated many times during the course  
of meditation practice. As attention is stabilized in the  
primary practice, open awareness or ‚Äúhovering attention‚Äù  
i  
s introduced and other aspects of attention may beemphasized. In between sessions, the participants are  
asked to ‚Äúpay attention to attention‚Äù and bring their  
a  
ttention to the present moment frequently throughouttheir daily routine. These activities are likely to engage  
diverse aspects of attention (e.g., alerting, orienting, and  
conflict attention), metacognition, inhibition, and work-ing memory.

During mindfulness training, par-ticipants learn to reduce aro  
usal through breathing andrelaxation exercises and to bring an openness and accep-tance to their emotional experiences. This practice  
teaches engagement in emotional states in a way that is  
neither avoidance, flooding, nor dissociation but rather  
‚Äúmindfully observing and being with the emotion.‚Äù In  
addition, shifting attention to a neutral focus (breath or  
soles of the feet) can be used to disengage from particu-larly intense emotional states. Reduction in negative  
affective reactivity and volatility in response to aversive  
visual stimuli (Arch & Craske, 2006) or emotionally  
provocative events (Broderick, 2005) have been reported

Feasibility Assessment

Twenty-five participants (18, or 75% of adults, and 7,  
or 87% of adolescents) completed the study, indicating

On average, participants attended seven of the eight  
sessions, with a range of six to eight (in both adult and  
adolescent groups). The adult group reported an average  
of 90.3 (S D= 57.9; range = 1  
0.3 to 194.4) min per weekof at-home meditation practice and an average of 4.9  
(S D= 1.6; range = 1.5 to 7) days of practice per week. The

6

adolescent group reported an average of 42.6 (S D= 1  
5.4;range = 2  
3.7 to 68.9) min per week of at-home practiceand an average of 4.02 (S D= 0.93; range = 2  
.4 to 5.6)days of practice per week. Adults practiced significantly  
more minutes per week than adolescents (p = .  
03). Onthe visual analog scale measuring satisfaction from 1  
(least satisfied) to 10 (most satisfied), satisfaction level  
was high among both adults (M = 9 .40,S D= 0  
.80) andadolescents (M = 9 .35,S D= 1

Exploratory Pre- and  
Posttraining Assessment

6

Adult and adolescent ADHD self-report (comparable  
D SM-IVcriteria items from ADHD Rating Scale‚ÄìIV and  
SNAP-IV) and neurocognitive data were combined to  
examine pre‚Äìpost training changes. As shown in Table 2,  
there were significant pre- to posttest improvements in  
ADHD self-reported symptoms and performance on sev-eral neurocognitive tasks.

E  
ighteen of the 23 (78%) participants reported areduction in their total ADHD symptoms, with 7 of the  
23 (30%) participants reporting at least a 30% s  
ymptomreduction (considered a clinically significant improvement).  
On neurocognitive task performance, significant improve-ments were found for measures of attentional c  
onflic

(ANT conflict and Stroop color-word) and set-shifting  
(Trails A and B) (all p < .01) but not for measures of  
working memory. To further illustrate the observed  
changes, we plotted individual performance on the ANT  
conflict task (Figure 1) and compared them to the aver-age scores for other ADHD samples and/or the general  
population. Of note, the mean posttraining ANT score in  
our ADHD sample is comparable to mean scores found  
elsewhere in non-ADHD adult (Fan, McCandliss,  
Sommer, Raz, & Posner, 2002) or adolescent samples (S.  
Smalley, personal communication, June 26, 2006).

Note: ANT = Attention Network Test.. The graph shows the individ-ual response times on the conflict attention subset of ANT at pre- (Time  
1) and posttraining (Time 2) assessments. Adults are represented by  
black circles and solid lines, and adolescents are represented by open  
circles and dashed lines. For comparison purposes, mean ANT conflict  
scores are found to be 132.2 ms (S D= 4  
0.1) in adolescents withADHD, 111.8 ms (S D= 39.4) in control adolescents (S. Smalley, per-sonal communication, June 26, 2006), and 84 ms (S D= 25) in a nor-mative sample of adults (Fan et al., 2002).

We used linear regression models to evaluate the  
effects of age, sex, stimulant medication status, and at-h  
ome meditation practice time (in minutes per week) onchanges showing significant improvement (i.e., ADHD  
symptoms, cognitive measures of ANT conflict and set-shifting, and adult mood and anxiety symptoms).  
Baseline score was a significant predictor of all change  
scores (data not shown); therefore, all regression models  
i  
ncluded the baseline score in an attempt to control forregression to the mean. Age was found to be inversely  
associated with improvement in Trails A (p = .  
03) (i.e.,younger age = more improvement), and at-home practice  
time was marginally associated with improvement in  
ANT conflict (p = .07). No other significant relationships  
at p < .05 were found for any other dependent variables.
