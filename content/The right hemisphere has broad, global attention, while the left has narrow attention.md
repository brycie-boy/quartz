## The right hemisphere has broad, global attention, while the left has narrow attention

There is evidence of [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) dominance for [spotlight consciousness](Spotlight%20consciousness.md) and [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) dominance for [lantern consciousness](Lantern%20consciousness.md). The scope of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s world is broad. Patients with a [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) lesion (therefore relying on their intact [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)) start with the pieces and put them together to get the overall picture, whereas those with a [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) lesion (relying on their [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)) prefer a global approach. Patients with [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) damage don't seem able to leave [spotlight consciousness](Spotlight%20consciousness.md): they suffer an excessive and more or less permanent narrowing of their attentional window. That's what happens when we have to rely on [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) attention on its own.
