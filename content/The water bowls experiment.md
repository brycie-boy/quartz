## The water bowls experiment  #

Ancient Greek philosophers were actually well aware that [[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]], and an illustration well-known in Athens during its Golden Age went like this: take three bowls of water. Make one of them hot, another cold, one medium-temperature, and the third cold. Put your right hand into the hot bowl, and your left hand into the cold bowl. Then put both hands into the medium-temperatured bowl. The water will feel "cold" to your right hand and "hot" to your left.
