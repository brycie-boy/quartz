## The water bowls experiment  #‚è≥

Ancient Greek philosophers were actually well aware that [the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input](The%20brain's%20perceptual%20systems%20actively%20and%20pre-consciously%20interpret%20and%20edit%20their%20input.md), and an illustration well-known in Athens during its Golden Age went like this: take three bowls of water. Make one of them hot, another cold, one medium-temperature, and the third cold. Put your right hand into the hot bowl, and your left hand into the cold bowl. Then put both hands into the medium-temperatured bowl. The water will feel "cold" to your right hand and "hot" to your left.
