## The right hemisphere brings anxious, disturbed depression while the left brings indifferent or apathetic depression

There is also evidence that the types of [depression](Depression.md) experienced in right posterior hypoactivity are different from those experienced in left frontal hypoactivity, in ways which are in keeping with the views of the worlds that the two [brain hemisphere]()s bring into being. Thus [depression](Depression.md) resulting from damage to the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) has more of indifference or apathy ‚Äì a global, vague lifelessness ‚Äì in contrast to the anxious, disturbed depression, accompanied by biological features, resulting from lesions to the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md). The sort of anxiety that accompanies depressed mood, and could be induced by reading a sad narrative, is known as anxious arousal, and shows greater lateralisation to the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md). By contrast anxious apprehension, based as it is on a fear of uncertainty and lack of control‚Äîpreoccupations of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)‚Äîis accompanied by preferential [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) activation.
