## The left hemisphere deals with conscious explicit linear reasoning, and the right with implicit unconscious deductive reasoning # 

While linear, sequential argument is clearly better executed by the [[left hemisphere]]. Other types of reasoning, including deduction, and some types of mathematical reasoning, are mainly dependent on the [[right hemisphere]]. More explicit reasoning is underwritten by the [[left hemisphere]], less explicit reasoning (such as is often involved in problem solving, including scientific and mathematical problem solving) by the [[right hemisphere]]. 

There is a relation between the pleasurable ‚Äòaha!‚Äô phenomenon of insight and the right [[amygdala]], which mediates interactions between emotions and higher frontal cognitive function. In fact an extensive body of research now indicates that insight, whether mathematical or verbal, the sort of problem solving that happens when we are, precisely, not concentrating on it, is associated with activation in the [[right hemisphere]], mainly in the right anterior [[temporal lobe]], specifically in the right anterior superior [[temporal gyrus]], though where there are high levels of restructuring involved there is also activity in the right [[prefrontal cortex]]. Insight is also a perception of the previous incongruity of one's assumptions, which links it to the [[right hemisphere]]'s capacity for detecting an anomaly.

Problem solving, making reasonable deductions, and making judgments may become harder if we become conscious of the process. Thus rendering one's thought processes explicit, or analysing a judgment, may actually impair performance, because it encourages the [[left hemisphere]]'s focus on the explicit, superficial structure of the problem.
