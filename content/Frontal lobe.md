## Frontal lobe # 

![[Pasted image 20230227143142.png|200]]

The frontal lobes are responsible for our ability to stand back from the world, from our selves and from the immediacy of experience. This enables us to plan, to think flexibly and inventively, and, in brief, to take control of the world around us rather than simply respond to it passively. These are the defining features of the human condition, and are what set us apart from animals. The frontal lobes represent about 7 per cent of the total [[brain]] volume of a relatively intelligent animal such as the dog, and take up about 17 per cent of the [[brain]] in the lesser apes, they represent as much as 35 per cent of the human [[brain]].
