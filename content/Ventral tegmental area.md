## Ventral tegmental area  #🧠

The ventral tegemental area is a primitive [nucleus]() in the [midbrain]() which is the origin of the [dopamine](Dopamine.md)rgic [cell]() bodies of the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md). The ventral tegmental area is primarily involved in [dopamine](Dopamine.md) production. The ventral tegmental area reacts to enviromental ques and sends [dopamine](Dopamine.md) to the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) to initiate motivation to act.
