## Exercise has been shown to raise levels of BDNF

[Carl Cotman](), Director of the Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia at the University of California, Irvine, set up an experiment to measure the levels of [BDNF](BDNF.md) in the [brain](Brain.md)s of mice that exercise. It was important that the exercise be voluntary because if he forced the mice to run on treadmills, he feared his peers might say the effect was from the stress of being handled. No problem: he‚Äôd use running wheels.

Unlike humans, rodents seem to inherently enjoy physical activity, and Cotman‚Äôs mice ran several kilometers a night. They were divided into four groups: mice running for two, four, or seven nights, and one control group with no running wheel. When their [brain](Brain.md)s were injected with a molecule that binds to [BDNF](BDNF.md) and scanned, not only did the scans of the running rodents show an increase in [BDNF](BDNF.md) over controls, but the farther each mouse ran, the higher the levels were. The levels of [BDNF](BDNF.md) were esspecially raised in the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md), which is signifigant considering that [Elevated levels of cortisol can shrink the hippocampus](Elevated%20levels%20of%20cortisol%20can%20shrink%20the%20hippocampus.md).
