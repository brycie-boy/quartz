## LSD has been shown to have a stronger affinity with the 5-HT2A receptor than seretonin  # 

[[LSD]] has an even stronger affinity with the [[5-HT2A]] [[receptor]]‚Äîis ‚Äústickier‚Äù‚Äîthan [[serotonin]] itself, making this an instance where the simulacrum is more convincing, chemically, than the original. This has led some scientists to speculate that the human body must produce some other, more bespoke chemical for the express purpose of activating the [[5-HT2A]] [[receptor]]‚Äîperhaps an endogenous [[psychedelic]] that is released under certain circumstances, perhaps when dreaming. One candidate for that chemical is the psychedelic molecule [[DMT]], which has been found in trace amounts in the [[pineal gland]] of rats.
