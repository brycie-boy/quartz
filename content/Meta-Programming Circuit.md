## Meta-Programming Circuit  # 

Any of the semantic games assosiated with [[predictive coding]] is a synecdoche of the [[Meta-Programming]] Circuit. The meta-programming circuit simply represents the brain becoming aware of itself. The artist seeing himself in his painting, seeing himself seeing himself in his painting ... In the Zen metaphor, it is a mirror that reflects anything, but does not hold onto anything. It is a conscious mirror that knows it can always reflect something else by changing its angle of reflection.

The [[Meta-Programming]] Circuit represents cybernetic consciousness; the programmer becoming self-programmer, self-metaprogrammer, meta-meta-programmer, etc. Just as the emotional compulsions of the [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] seem primitive, mechanical and, ultimately, silly to the [[Neurosomatic Circuit]], so, too, the [[reality tunnel]] of the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|Semantic Circuit]] become comic, relativistic, game-like to the metaprogrammer.

- [[The right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior]]
- [[The right frontal lobes enables one to step back form espousing ‘my’ position, which enables us to empathize and consider the others point of view]]
- [[Those with impairments in the right frontolimbic regions have trouble with stopping whatever they're currently doing]]
- [[The left frontal lobe enables one to peacefully detach from the striving towards individual gain]]

The meta-programming circuit is the most recent in evolutionary time is associated with the [[frontal lobe]]s.

and involves further diactivation of the [[default mode network]], leading to [[the fourth jhana]], which then leads to [[Insight]]. This is why the traditional Hindu exercize to activate it is to fix the consciousness in the front of the forehead and hold it there. Eventually the metaprogrammer awakes and you begin to perceive and create infinite realities where before there was only one static [[habit]]ual “reality” in which you were trapped. "Whatever you say it is, it isn’t,” Korzybski, the semanticist, repeated endlessly in his seminars, trying to make clear that third-circuit semantic maps are not the territories they represent; that we can always make maps of our maps, revisions of our revisions, meta-selves of our selves.

this circuit is the “soul” of the Gnostics, as distinct from the self. The self seems to be fixed and firm, but is not; that is, whatever circuit you are operating on at the moment is your “self’ at that moment. If I point a gun at you, you go to Circuit I consciousness at once, and that is your “self’ at that instant. But if you are sexually attracted to somebody, you go to Circuit IV and that is your “self’ until you are orgasmically satisfied (or hopelessly frustrated). Most of the preliminary exercizes in Sufi and Gurdjieff schools consist in making you aware that the “self’ is not constant but shifts back and forth between the imprints on the various circuits. [[Nibbana]] or the [[Meta-programming]] is constant, because it is void or without form. It plays all the roles you play—oral dependent, emotional tyrant, cool rationalist, romantic seducer, neurosomatic healer, neurogenetic Evolutionary Visionary—but it is none of them. It is plastic. It is without form, because it is all forms. It is the “creative Void” of the Taoists.

“Mind” is a tool invented by the universe to see itself; but it can never see all of itself, for much the same reason that you can’t see your own back (without mirrors). Or as because the tongue ultimately cannot taste the tongue.

Ideas about ideas—mathematics about mathematics (Godel)—language about language—consciousness of consciousness—the whole seventh circuit brings us into what Hofstadter calls [[Strange Loop]]s. Like the legendary ko-ko bird, we follow our own tail around in ever-narrowing circles, but unlike that mythic bird we never complete the process by flying up our own rectums and disappearing. It just seems like we’re about to self-destruct in that colorful way, and we decide that what we have been reading, or thinking, or perceiving, must be “nonsense.” It is not nonsense. We are merely confronting infinity where we least expected to encounter it—in our own lonely selves.
