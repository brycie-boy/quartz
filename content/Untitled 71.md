## Heading # 

ADHD is thought to develop from a stressful early childhood. [[The brains of abused or neglected children show reductions of the size of several brain structures]], including the [[prefrontal cortex]]. [[A stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life]], and [[the overactive stress response of those who had a stressful childhood leads to an overvaluation of short-term relief]]. All of this can interfere with one’s ability to maintain motivation and focus toward [[delayed gratification|delayed rewards]]. It may also contribute to impulsivity, as those with such impairments struggle to see the long-term harm of their actions.

I hypothesize that hyperactivity is the aftermath of impulsivity. It's not low levels of [[dopamine]], but low levels of [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s. The impulsive indulgence in [[short-term gratification]] causes [[down-regulation]] of [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s overtime, and [[lower dopamine receptor quantities cause cravings to bring dopamine back to balance]]. Those with ADHD may need constant stimulation through behaviors such as fidgeting to maintain adequate [[dopamine]] levels.
