## Subjective bias #🧠 

Subjective biases are individual inclinations shaped by [[Imprint]]ing and [[conditioning]]. The more that a behavior is repeated, the more we learn to see the world through a [[reality tunnel]] that is biased, based on rewards and punishments from previous actions. We form a [[habit]]ual way of seeing. And it is subjective because it is particular to our own personal tastes. 

Overtime, we get used to wearing a particular set of glasses, adhering to a particular [[reality tunnel]] more and more, and we forget we’re wearing them. They become an extension of us—a [[habit]] or even an Objective Truth. Overtime, our [[reality tunnel]] becomes so reflexive that we fail to question our knee jerk assumptions, and as a result, [[we generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs]]. I believe subjective bias involves the [[left hemisphere]], since [[novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]].
