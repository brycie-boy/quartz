## Subjective bias  #‚è≥

Subjective biases are the individual inclinations shaped by [Imprint](Imprint.md)ing and [conditioning](Conditioning.md). The more that a particular behavior is repeated, the more we learn to see the world through a [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) that is biased, based on rewards and punishments from previous actions. We form a [habit](Habit.md)ual way of seeing. And it is subjective because it is particular to our own personal tastes. I believe it to involve the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), because [novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar](Novel%20experience%20and%20information%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20right%20hemisphere,%20and%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20once%20it%20becomes%20familiar.md).

Overtime, we get used to wearing a particular set of glasses, adhering to a particular [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) more and more, and we forget we are wearing them. They become an extension of us‚Äîa [habit](Habit.md) or even an Objective Truth. Overtime, our [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) becomes so reflexive that we fail to question our knee jerk assumptions, and as a result, [We generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs](We%20generally%20struggle%20to%20examine%20and%20criticize%20our%20own%20neural%20programs.md).
