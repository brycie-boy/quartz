## Predictive coding

In neuroscience, predictive coding refers to the process in which [the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input](The%20brain's%20perceptual%20systems%20actively%20and%20pre-consciously%20interpret%20and%20edit%20their%20input.md). It is the responsibility of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) and the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md). [The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md), and the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) filters out irrelevent signals: [our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important](Our%20brains%20unconsciously%20focus%20on%20only%20a%20select%20few%20of%20the%20sensory%20signals%20it%20receives%20that%20it%20considers%20important.md).
