## The right hemisphere can understand unclear and fleeting images, while the left requires clarity and stillness

[The left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20be%20stubbornly%20certain,%20whereas%20the%20right%20acknowledges%20ambiguity%20and%20is%20always%20uncertain.md), so as we may expect, blurred or indistinct images are not a problem for the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), but are for the [left](Left%20hemisphere.md), even where the nature of the task would suggest that it should be more problematic for the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md). One of the most consistent early findings in hemisphere specialization was that whenever an image is either only fleetingly presented, or presented in a degraded form, so that only partial information is available, a [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) superiority emerges—even when the material is verbal. In some subtle experimental work, [Justine Sergent]() was able to demonstrate this and its converse, namely that when images are presented for longer than usual, thus increasing their certainty and familiarity, a [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) superiority emerges, even when it comes to face recognition.

She makes the interesting observation that letters of the alphabet ‘represent a finite set of stimuli that are sharply focused, familiar and overlearned’, whereas visual images ‘represent a potentially infinite set of shapes of large visual angle size, with different levels of structure of unequal importance and salience that are most often unfamiliar to subjects’. In doing so she neatly reveals a common thread which unites, on the one hand, the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)'s affinity for what it itself has made (here language), well-worn familiarity , certainty and finitude, and, on the other, the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s affinity for all that is ‘other’, new, unknown, uncertain and unbounded: [Novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar](Novel%20experience%20and%20information%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20right%20hemisphere,%20and%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20once%20it%20becomes%20familiar.md).

Again what have to be referred to, [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) fashion, as separate ‘functions’ (or areas of concern), should also be seen, [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) fashion, as aspects of one and the same entity that are only artificially separated in the process of description. The ‘functions’ are not arbitrarily housed together in this or that hemisphere: they form, in the case of either hemisphere, aspects of two whole ways of being in the world.
