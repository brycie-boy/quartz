## The environment that we live in is an external reflection of the internal processes of the mind #‚è≥ 

The doctrines of [[kamma]] and [[rebirth]] enable us to see that the environment that we live in is an external reflection of the internal processes of the mind. The reason why a living being is reborn in a paticular realm is because in a previous life that being has generated the [[kamma]]. Thus, all the realms of existance have been formed, fashioned, and sustained by the mental activity of living beings. [[The Buddha]] refers to [[kamma]] as the field, [[consciousness]] as the seed, and craving as the moisture, for [[consciousness]] to be established in a new realm of existance.
