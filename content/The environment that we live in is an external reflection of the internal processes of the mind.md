## The environment that we live in is an external reflection of the internal processes of the mind #‚è≥

The doctrines of [kamma](Kamma.md) and [rebirth](Rebirth.md) enable us to see that the environment that we live in is an external reflection of the internal processes of the mind. The reason why a living being is reborn in a paticular realm is because in a previous life that being has generated the [kamma](Kamma.md). Thus, all the realms of existance have been formed, fashioned, and sustained by the mental activity of living beings. [The Buddha]() refers to [kamma](Kamma.md) as the field, [consciousness](Consciousness.md) as the seed, and craving as the moisture, for [consciousness](Consciousness.md) to be established in a new realm of existance.
