## Liberal Humean #🧠 

One who has had their mind enlarged or ruined by a good course in [[epistemology]] might come out a [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], or absolutist, or a Humean—convinced that all proof is impossible and no idea is any more valid than another. But a wiser and less logical student might become merely a liberal Humean—one who holds that no proof is absolute but some ideas are more plausible than others, e.g. "If it rains, the streets will get wet."
