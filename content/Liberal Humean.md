## Liberal Humean #🧠

One who has had their mind enlarged or ruined by a good course in [epistemology](Epistemology.md) might come out a [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism.md), or absolutist, or a Humean—convinced that all proof is impossible and no idea is any more valid than another. But a wiser and less logical student might become merely a liberal Humean—one who holds that no proof is absolute but some ideas are more plausible than others, e.g. "If it rains, the streets will get wet."
