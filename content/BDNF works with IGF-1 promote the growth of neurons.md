## BDNF works with IGF-1 promote the growth of neurons

The role of [IGF-1](IGF-1.md) in the brain isn‚Äôt related to fuel management, but to learning ‚Äî presumably so we can remember where to locate food in the environment. During exercise, [BDNF](BDNF.md) helps the [bra[[Brain]()in\]\] increase the uptake of [IGF-1](IGF-1.md), and it activates [neuron](Neuron.md)s to produce the signaling [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s [serotonin](Serotonin.md) and [glutamate](Glutamate.md). It then spurs the production of more [BDNF](BDNF.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s, beefing up connections to solidify memories. 

In particular, [BDNF](BDNF.md) seems to be important for long-term memories. Which makes perfect sense in light of evolution. If we strip everything else away, the reason we need an ability to learn is to help us find and obtain and store food. We need fuel to learn, and we need learning to find a source of fuel ‚Äî and all these messengers from the body keep this process going and keep us adapting and surviving.
