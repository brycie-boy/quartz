## The first jhana  #⏳

The first of [the jhanas](The%20jhanas.md) involves thought and examination and includes [piti](Piti.md) born from seclusion. I believe the it has to do with the fact that [decreased default mode network activity may loosen the inhibitory mechanims in the brain](Decreased%20default%20mode%20network%20activity%20may%20loosen%20the%20inhibitory%20mechanims%20in%20the%20brain.md), allowing unconscious material to float to the surface of our awareness.
