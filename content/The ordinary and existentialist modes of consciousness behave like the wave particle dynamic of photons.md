## The ordinary and existentialist modes of consciousness behave like the wave particle dynamic of photons

To ask whether [hypnotized consciousness](Hypnotized%20consciousness.md) or [existentialist consciousness](Existentialist%20consciousness.md) is "true" after experiencing both seems to be as pointless as asking whether light is "really" waves or particles after seeing [the two-hole experiment](The%20two-hole%20experiment.md). In fact, the emphasis on choice and creativity has an exact parallel in [the two-hole experiment](The%20two-hole%20experiment.md). Many physicists think that the best metaphor to describe the experiment is that we "create" the have or particle dependent on which experimental setup we "choose."

The wave/particle complimentary seem to mirror the existential mode of consciousness even more closely when we examine it. The ordinary consciousness of the "self"‚Äîin the conventional sense‚Äîis much like a particle: "solid," "isolated," "real," encapsulated by the skin and more or less static. When on becomes detached enough for neurological self-criticism, the self appears more like a process and even a wavey process: it is a succession of states rather than a state itself and that these states come and go in a wave-like manner, flowing between "inner" and "outer," and [impermanent](Impermanence.md). This is how the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) would see it: [the right hemisphere is responsible for our sense of time as continuous and unified](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20our%20sense%20of%20time%20as%20continuous%20and%20unified.md). As one observes them arise and pass, one learns to choose desirable states, at least to the same extent that one "chooses" waves or particles. This simple experience, available to all, makes clear that [in-unite-ual](In-unite-ual.md) and flowing modes of consciousness are existentially as "real" as the [in-divide-ual](In-divide-ual.md) "particles"  that we normally experience as our "selves," as the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) sees: [the left hemisphere perceives time as a sequential series of fragmented individual moments](The%20left%20hemisphere%20perceives%20time%20as%20a%20sequential%20series%20of%20fragmented%20individual%20moments.md).

One of the best ways to learn how to experience the wave-aspect of [consciousness](Consciousness.md) is listening to music, especially Baroque music, with ones eyes closed. Much quicker than meditation, this makes one aware of consciousnesses wave-like flowing aspect, and of its [synergetic](Synergy.md) nature. At its richest, as in meditation, consciousness appears to become the object of its attention. "There is no separation between me and the music" we say.
