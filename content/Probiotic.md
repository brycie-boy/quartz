## Probiotic

Probiotics are live bacteria that convey health benefits when eaten. Probiotics can break down [prebiotic](Prebiotic.md)s to form [short-chain fatty acid]()s that help reduce [gut]() [inflammation](), block the growth of [cancer]()ous [cell]()s, and help the growth of healthy [cell]()s.

Probiotics are available in supplements, but it‚Äôs preferable to increase your levels of friendly [gut bacteria]() through dietary sources. Yogurt with active cultures is one of the best sources of probiotics; just avoid fruited yogurts high in added sugars. Other probiotic-rich foods include tempeh, miso, and natto; sauerkraut; kefir; kimchi; kombucha; buttermilk; and select cheeses such as cheddar, mozzarella, and Gouda.
