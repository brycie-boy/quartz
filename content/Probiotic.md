## Probiotic  # 

Probiotics are live bacteria that convey health benefits when eaten. Probiotics can break down [[prebiotic]]s to form [[short-chain fatty acid]]s that help reduce [[gut]] [[inflammation]], block the growth of [[cancer]]ous [[cell]]s, and help the growth of healthy [[cell]]s.

Probiotics are available in supplements, but it’s preferable to increase your levels of friendly [[gut bacteria]] through dietary sources. Yogurt with active cultures is one of the best sources of probiotics; just avoid fruited yogurts high in added sugars. Other probiotic-rich foods include tempeh, miso, and natto; sauerkraut; kefir; kimchi; kombucha; buttermilk; and select cheeses such as cheddar, mozzarella, and Gouda.
