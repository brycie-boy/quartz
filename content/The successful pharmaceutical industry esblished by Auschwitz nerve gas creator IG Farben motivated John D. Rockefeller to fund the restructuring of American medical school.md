## The successful pharmaceutical industry esblished by Auschwitz nerve gas creator IG Farben motivated John D. Rockefeller to fund the restructuring of American medical school

[In the late 19th century, John D. Rockefeller's buisness advisor Fredrick Gates had him to open a medical research institute](In%20the%20late%2019th%20century,%20John%20D.%20Rockefeller's%20buisness%20advisor%20Fredrick%20Gates%20had%20him%20to%20open%20a%20medical%20research%20institute.md). But [Rockefeller]() was just getting started in the drug business. Aside from the Rockefellers, the next biggest shareholder in Standard Oil was German chemical conglomerate [IG Farben](), best known for creating Zyklon B, the nerve gas used in Auschwitz. By the early 1900s, Farben had developed a successful pharmaceutical industry, with drugs such as aspirin, salvarsan (an arsenic compound used for syphilis), and novocaine.

[Rockefeller]() saw yet a new drug opportunity and untapped market‚Äîbut he also saw that American physicians didn‚Äôt know about these new pharmaceuticals, in part because they didn‚Äôt learn about them in medical school. [Rockefeller]() needed distributors to sling this product, and so green-lighted a project to completely re-evaluate the American medical school system in order to dismantle it and reformulate it to focus on medical research and drug therapy. [Abraham Flexner was assigned to direct John D. Rockefellers restructering of American medical school](Abraham%20Flexner%20was%20assigned%20to%20direct%20John%20D.%20Rockefellers%20restructering%20of%20American%20medical%20school.md).
