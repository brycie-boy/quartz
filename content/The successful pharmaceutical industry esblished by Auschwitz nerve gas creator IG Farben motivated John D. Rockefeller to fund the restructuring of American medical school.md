## The successful pharmaceutical industry esblished by Auschwitz nerve gas creator IG Farben motivated John D. Rockefeller to fund the restructuring of American medical school # 

[[In the late 19th century, John D. Rockefeller's buisness advisor Fredrick Gates had him to open a medical research institute]]. But [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] was just getting started in the drug business. Aside from the Rockefellers, the next biggest shareholder in Standard Oil was German chemical conglomerate [[IG Farben]], best known for creating Zyklon B, the nerve gas used in Auschwitz. By the early 1900s, Farben had developed a successful pharmaceutical industry, with drugs such as aspirin, salvarsan (an arsenic compound used for syphilis), and novocaine.

[[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] saw yet a new drug opportunity and untapped market‚Äîbut he also saw that American physicians didn‚Äôt know about these new pharmaceuticals, in part because they didn‚Äôt learn about them in medical school. [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]] needed distributors to sling this product, and so green-lighted a project to completely re-evaluate the American medical school system in order to dismantle it and reformulate it to focus on medical research and drug therapy. [[Abraham Flexner was assigned to direct John D. Rockefellers restructering of American medical school]].
