## An error in our Magick creates conflict with our own nature since change is not occurring in conformity with our True Will # 

[[Magick]] is not a matter extraneous to the main current of your life. Every act of your life is a [[Magick]]al act; whenever from ignorance, carelessness, clumsiness, or what not, you come short of perfect artistic success, you inevitably register failure, discomfort, frustration. Luckily for all of us, most of the acts essential to continued life are involuntary; the 'unconscious' has become so used to doing its [[True Will]] that there is no need of interference; when such need a rises, we call it disease, and seek to restore the machine to free spontaneous fulfillment of its function.

If we are to do anything at all beyond automatic vegetative living, we must consciously apply ourselves to [[Magick]], the art of causing change to occur in conformity with the Will. The least slackness or error means that things happen which do not conform. When this is so despite our efforts, we are (temporarily) baffled: when it is our own ignorance of what we ought to will, or lack of skill in adapting our means to the right end, then we set up a conflict in our own nature: our act is suicidal. Such interior struggle is at the base a variety of [[neurosis|neuroses]].
