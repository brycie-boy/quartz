## VEGF

VEGF is a [hormone]() which helps with building more [capillaries]() in the [body]() and the [brain](Brain.md) when our body’s [cell]()s run short of [oxygen](), as they can when our muscles contract during exercise.

Researchers suspect that one way VEGF is vital to [neurogenesis](Neurogenesis.md) is its role in changing the permeability of the [blood-brain barrier](), prying back the fence to let other factors through during exercise.
