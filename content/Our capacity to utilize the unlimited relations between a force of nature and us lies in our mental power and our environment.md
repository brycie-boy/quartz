## Our capacity to utilize the unlimited relations between a force of nature and us lies in our mental power and our environment # 

[[We may attract any force by making ourselves a fit condition for its manifestation]]. There is no limit to the extent of the relations of any person with the Universe in essence; for as soon as anybody makes themselves one with any idea, the means of measurement cease to exist. But their power to utilize that force is limited by their mental power and capacity, and by the circumstances of their environment. [[Magick]] is the Science of understanding oneself and one's conditions. For example, a golf club is intended to move a special ball in a special way in special circumstances. But, also, the use of any club demands skill and experience.
