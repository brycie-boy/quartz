I think the *old friend* is the mushroom. Which has accompanied mammals for millions of years. Not sure how that flew over my head. 

The mushroom allowed me to too see the world as if it was being presented to me for the first time and I was trying to make sense of it. Everything was morphing and changing. It was endless novelty. This is what I think is meant my “introduces you to new pleasures” and “a courtyard of pinecones brings pines eternal joy.”
