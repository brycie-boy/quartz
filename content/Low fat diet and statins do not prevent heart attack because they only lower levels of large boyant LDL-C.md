## Low fat diet and statins do not prevent heart attack because they only lower levels of large boyant LDL-C  # 

It‚Äôs true that fewer people are actually dying of [[heart attack]]s in the US and other high-income countries (although low-income countries still have high mortality rates). But that statistic belies the truth. While fewer are dying of [[heart attack]]s, more people are suffering them. Of course rising numbers could be due to improved recognition, ambulance response time, emergency room functioning, the clot-buster tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and [[heart attack]] post-care. But the real story is that more people are suffering [[heart attack]]s with lower [[LDL-C]] levels than before, because the standard fasting [[lipid]] profile‚Äîthe blood test ordered by your practitioner to test your [[cholesterol]]‚Äîassumes that all [[LDL]] particles are the same.

There are two different [[LDL]]s, but the [[lipid]] profile test measures them together. The majority (80 percent) of circulating [[LDL]] species are called large buoyant or type A [[LDL]], which are increased by dietary fat consumption. This is the species reduced by eating low-fat or by taking [[statin]]s. However, large buoyant [[LDL]] is cardiovascularly neutral‚Äîmeaning it‚Äôs not the particle driving the accumulation of [[plaque]] in the [[artery|arteries]] leading to [[heart disease]]. Then there‚Äôs a second, less common (only 20 percent) [[LDL]] species called small dense or type B [[LDL]].

There is some debate as to whether or not it‚Äôs the actual perpetrator of the [[plaque]], but it doesn‚Äôt matter; small dense [[LDL]] is predictive of risk for a [[heart attack]]. The problem is that [[statin]]s will lower your [[LDL-C]] because they‚Äôre lowering the type A [[LDL]], which is 80 percent of the total; but they‚Äôre not doing anything to the type B [[LDL]], which is the problematic particle.
