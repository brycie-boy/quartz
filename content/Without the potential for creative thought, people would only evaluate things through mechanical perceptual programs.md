## Without the potential for creative thought, people would only evaluate things through mechanical perceptual programs  #‚è≥

It appears that, over the aeons, some domesticated primates have noticed how [we generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs](We%20generally%20struggle%20to%20examine%20and%20criticize%20our%20own%20neural%20programs.md) and have developed the ability to do so themselves. The members of this group cannot be mechanically predicted. At times they may exhibit the characteristics we refer to as "growth" or "creativity." And it also appears that [Idolatry](Idolatry.md) and [Fundamentalism](Fundamentalism.md) can be biologically described as normal mammalian behavior‚Äîmechanical [imprint](Imprint.md)ing and [conditioning](Conditioning.md) combined with the fact that [people have a tendency to become territorial over their belief systems](People%20have%20a%20tendency%20to%20become%20territorial%20over%20their%20belief%20systems.md). In that case, unless any real possibility of creative thought exists, only mechanical [predictive coding](Predictive%20coding.md) will determine how we evaluate any incident or event, from the chair across the room to tales of bleeding catholic statues or charmed quarks or UFOs. 

Artists, as well as mystics, are always telling us how we do not look at the world closely enough. We follow [habit](Habit.md)ual programs so often that we forget to exercise our potential creativity. The artist tries to jar us out of this [conditioned](Conditioning.md) or hypnotic state by presenting something to us in a new way. The mystic may try to jar us by getting us to [establish mindfulness](The%20establishments%20of%20mindfulness.md) on an object until‚Äîthrough the stress of social and sensory deprivation‚Äîwe stop "seeing" the what we have always saw and start "seeing" in a new way. Here we use  neither the artist or the mystic method but instead try to look at the things which we ordinarily ignore and dismiss without placing one of our habitual [idol](Idol.md)s in the way of our vision.
