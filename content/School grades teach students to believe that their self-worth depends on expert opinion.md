## School grades teach students to believe that their self-worth depends on expert opinion

If you‚Äôve ever tried to wrestle into line kids whose parents have convinced them to believe they‚Äôll be loved in spite of anything, you know how impossible it is to make self-confident spirits conform. Our world wouldn‚Äôt survive a flood of confident people very long, so our schools teach that a kid‚Äôs self-worth should depend on expert opinion. Students are constantly evaluated and judged. A monthly report, impressive in its provision, is sent into a student‚Äôs home to elicit approval or mark exactly, down to a single percentage point, how dissatisfied with the child a parent should be. The ecology of ‚Äúgood‚Äù schooling depends on perpetuating dissatisfaction, just as the commercial economy depends on the same fertilizer. Although some people might be surprised how little time or reflection goes into making up these mathematical records, the cumulative weight of these objective-seeming documents establishes a profile that compels children to arrive at certain decisions about themselves and their futures based on the casual judgment of strangers. Self-evaluation is never considered a factor. The lesson of report cards, grades, and tests is that children should not trust themselves or their parents but should instead rely on the evaluation of certified officials. People need to be told what they are worth.
