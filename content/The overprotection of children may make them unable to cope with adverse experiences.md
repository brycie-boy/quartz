## The overprotection of children may make them unable to cope with adverse experiences # 

The foolishness of overprotection children is apparent as soon as you understand the concept of [[antifragility]]. Given that risks and [[stressor]]s are natural, unavoidable parts of life, parents and teachers should be helping kids develop their innate abilities to grow and learn from such experiences. There’s an old saying: “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.” But these days, we seem to be doing precisely the opposite: we’re trying to clear away anything that might upset children. If we protect children from various classes of potentially upsetting experiences, we make it far more likely that those children will be unable to cope with such events when they leave our protective umbrella.
