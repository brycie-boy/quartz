## Informational influence

Informational influence is a type of social influence wherein people copy the actions of others in choosing how to behave in a given situation. Informational influence is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behavior, and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation. Informational influence is one type of [conformity](Conformity.md).
