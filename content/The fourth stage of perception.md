## The fourth stage of perception #🧠 

The fourth stage of perception (see [[the third stage of perception]]) involves the "percept", the basic mental "image" or "idea" that emerges after the [[right hemisphere]] has processed the original energy signals plus the additions and minus the subtractions. The transition between stage four and [[the fifth stage of perception|stage five]] invovles the most subtle and nefarious stage of all, the feedback between the incoming energy (plus additions and minus subtractions) and the language system which the [[left hemisphere]] happens to use [[habit]]ually (including symbolic, abstract languages like mathematics).
