## Variable reward  # 

Because [[a dopamine release occurs when we explore and evaluate the potential value of novel objects and situations]], many of the most [[habit]]-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. In psychology, this is known as a variable reward. Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of [[dopamine]], enhances memory recall, and accelerates [[habit]] formation.
