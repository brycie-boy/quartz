## Variable reward

Because [a dopamine release occurs when we explore and evaluate the potential value of novel objects and situations](A%20dopamine%20release%20occurs%20when%20we%20explore%20and%20evaluate%20the%20potential%20value%20of%20novel%20objects%20and%20situations.md), many of the most [habit](Habit.md)-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. In psychology, this is known as a variable reward. Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of [dopamine](Dopamine.md), enhances memory recall, and accelerates [habit](Habit.md) formation.
