## The Neurosomatic Circuit is responible for Gestalt thinking and awareness

[Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) awareness is “non-linear” and “global.” That is, it is not limited by the one-thing-at-a-time sequences of the [Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md); it thinks in Gestalts. This is why it is so often connected with “intuition,” which is a way of thinking between and around data-points on the perceptual screen—sensing what total field the points must be part of. The great musician has developed a remarkable feedback between [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) Gestalt-ing and the [Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md) function of coding such “coherent structures” into the inspired symbolism of music. Music always leads to some [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) activity in listeners, and the [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) almost certainly involves the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md).

[Beethoven](), we remember, was left-handed. Since the left hand is neurologically linked to the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), one might say he was genetically inclined to [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) ways of thinking, that is, to sensing coherent wholes, to plunging into [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) bliss almost “at will,” and to sensory-sensual raptness and rapture. Everybody “knows” that the Sixth Symphony is “[pantheistic](Pantheism.md),” but whether Beethoven was an ideological [pantheist](Pantheism.md) or not, that way of responding to nature is normal and natural [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) functioning. That is, anybody on the [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) will “talk like a [pantheist](Pantheism.md)” whether or not he has developed a “philosophy” about [pantheism](Pantheism.md). The miracle of Beethoven is not that he felt the universe that way—a few thousand [Neurosomatic Circuit](Neurosomatic%20Circuit.md) types throughout history have also felt and sensed nature that way—but that he mastered the [Semantic Circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md) art of music with such skill that he could communicate such experiences, which is precisely what the ordinary “mystic” cannot do.
