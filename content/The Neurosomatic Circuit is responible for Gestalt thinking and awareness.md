## The Neurosomatic Circuit is responible for Gestalt thinking and awareness # 

[[Neurosomatic Circuit]] awareness is “non-linear” and “global.” That is, it is not limited by the one-thing-at-a-time sequences of the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|Semantic Circuit]]; it thinks in Gestalts. This is why it is so often connected with “intuition,” which is a way of thinking between and around data-points on the perceptual screen—sensing what total field the points must be part of. The great musician has developed a remarkable feedback between [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] Gestalt-ing and the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|Semantic Circuit]] function of coding such “coherent structures” into the inspired symbolism of music. Music always leads to some [[right hemisphere]] activity in listeners, and the [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] almost certainly involves the [[right hemisphere]].

[[Ludwig Beethoven|Beethoven]], we remember, was left-handed. Since the left hand is neurologically linked to the [[right hemisphere]], one might say he was genetically inclined to [[right hemisphere]] ways of thinking, that is, to sensing coherent wholes, to plunging into [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] bliss almost “at will,” and to sensory-sensual raptness and rapture. Everybody “knows” that the Sixth Symphony is “[[Pantheism|pantheistic]],” but whether Beethoven was an ideological [[Pantheism|pantheist]] or not, that way of responding to nature is normal and natural [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] functioning. That is, anybody on the [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] will “talk like a [[pantheism|pantheist]]” whether or not he has developed a “philosophy” about [[pantheism]]. The miracle of Beethoven is not that he felt the universe that way—a few thousand [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] types throughout history have also felt and sensed nature that way—but that he mastered the [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|Semantic Circuit]] art of music with such skill that he could communicate such experiences, which is precisely what the ordinary “mystic” cannot do.
