## Relaxation broadens attention and enables right hemisphere flexibility of thought # 

One of the standard psychological tests that is supposed to measure creativity is the [[Remote Association Test]], an expression of the belief that creativity requires the ability to make associations between widely different ideas or concepts. [[The right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior]], and since efforts of will focus attention and deliberately narrow its range, it may be that relaxation favours creativity because it permits [[lantern consciousness]], and, with the expansion of the attentional field, engagement of the [[right hemisphere]].

From what has been said it can be seen that relatively more remote or tenuous associations of thought are made more easily by permitting [[lantern consciousness]], which may also explain the ‚Äòtip of the tongue‚Äô phenomenon: the harder we try, the more we recruit the narrow [[spotlight consciousness]] of the [[left hemisphere]], and the less we can remember the word. Once we stop trying, the word comes to us unbidden.
