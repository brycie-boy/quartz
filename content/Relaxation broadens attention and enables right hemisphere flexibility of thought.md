## Relaxation broadens attention and enables right hemisphere flexibility of thought

One of the standard psychological tests that is supposed to measure creativity is the [Remote Association Test](), an expression of the belief that creativity requires the ability to make associations between widely different ideas or concepts. [The right hemisphere allows for flexibility in thought and behavior](The%20right%20hemisphere%20allows%20for%20flexibility%20in%20thought%20and%20behavior.md), and since efforts of will focus attention and deliberately narrow its range, it may be that relaxation favours creativity because it permits [lantern consciousness](Lantern%20consciousness.md), and, with the expansion of the attentional field, engagement of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md).

From what has been said it can be seen that relatively more remote or tenuous associations of thought are made more easily by permitting [lantern consciousness](Lantern%20consciousness.md), which may also explain the ‚Äòtip of the tongue‚Äô phenomenon: the harder we try, the more we recruit the narrow [spotlight consciousness](Spotlight%20consciousness.md) of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), and the less we can remember the word. Once we stop trying, the word comes to us unbidden.
