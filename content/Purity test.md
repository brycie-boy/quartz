## Purity test #🧠 

A purity test is a rigid standard used by [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] by which someone is compared to ensure that the subject maintains ideological purity with the ideas supported by a particular group. Purity tests are often used in the form of strict [[In-group and out-group]] boundaries, where failure of purity tests dictates one’s membership in an out-group.
