## Purity test #🧠

A purity test is a rigid standard used by [fundamentalists](Fundamentalism.md) by which someone is compared to ensure that the subject maintains ideological purity with the ideas supported by a particular group. Purity tests are often used in the form of strict [In-group and out-group](In-group%20and%20out-group.md) boundaries, where failure of purity tests dictates one’s membership in an out-group.
