## Habit

A habit is a routine of behavior that is repeated regularly and tends to occur unconsciously. It is described as a more or less fixed way of thinking, willing, or feeling acquired through previous repetition of a mental experience. Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks. The [basal ganglia](Basal%20ganglia.md) is highly involved in the formation and carrying out of habits.
