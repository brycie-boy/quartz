## Self-reliance

Self-reliance refers to an attitude of mind in which one places complete trust in their own intuitions and relies on themselves as the basis for truth and morality rather than [appealing to authority](Appeal%20to%20authority.md) or [the majority](Appeal%20to%20majority.md). It is the opposite of [conformity](Conformity.md): [to be self-reliant and innovative requires not conforming to social norms](To%20be%20self-reliant%20and%20innovative%20requires%20not%20conforming%20to%20social%20norms.md). I assume such an attitude would involve the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), since [The right hemisphere attends to the personal, while the left focuses on the abstract and impersonal](The%20right%20hemisphere%20attends%20to%20the%20personal,%20while%20the%20left%20focuses%20on%20the%20abstract%20and%20impersonal.md).
