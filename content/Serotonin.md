## Serotonin  #üß† 

Serotonin is a [[tryptamine]] [[neurotransmitter]] who's biological function is complex and multifaceted, modulating mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and¬†vasoconstriction. 

Serotonin is sythesized in a part of the [[brain]] called the [[dorsal raphe nuclei]]. Its primary building block is the [[amino acid]] [[tryptophan]]. it binds with at least fourteen different [[receptor]]s, and these are found not only across many parts of the [[brain]] but throughout the body, with a substantial representation in the [[digestive tract]]. Depending on the type of [[receptor]] in question and its location, serotonin is liable to make very different things happen‚Äîsometimes exciting a [[neuron]] to fire, other times inhibiting it. When serotonin signals are interpreted in the [[brain]] either separately or together, we describe the neural experience as some version of [[happiness]]. It is known that serotonin in the [[brain]] is partially involved in contentment and well-being. Serotonin is often called the policeman of the [[brain]] because it helps keep brain activity under control. It influences mood, impulsivity, anger, and aggressiveness.
