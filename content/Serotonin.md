## Serotonin

Serotonin is a [tryptamine](Tryptamine.md) [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) who's biological function is complex and multifaceted, modulating mood, cognition, reward, learning, memory, and numerous physiological processes such as vomiting and¬†vasoconstriction. 

Serotonin in sythesized in a part of the [brain](Brain.md), called the [raphe nuclei](). Its primary building block is the [amino acid]() [tryptophan](). it binds with a dozen or so different [receptor](Receptor.md)s, and these are found not only across many parts of the [brain](Brain.md) but throughout the body, with a substantial representation in the [digestive tract](). Depending on the type of [receptor](Receptor.md) in question and its location, serotonin is liable to make very different things happen‚Äîsometimes exciting a [neuron](Neuron.md) to fire, other times inhibiting it. Serotonin has at least fourteen different brain [receptor](Receptor.md)s to which it binds. When these signals are interpreted either separately or together, we describe the neural experience as some version of happiness. It is known that serotonin in the [brain](Brain.md) is partially involved in contentment and well-being. Serotonin is often called the policeman of the [brain](Brain.md) because it helps keep brain activity under control. It influences mood, impulsivity, anger, and aggressiveness.
