## The brain acts as an electro-colloidal computer

The [brian]() seems to be made up of matter in electro-colloidal suspension (protoplasm). Colloids are pulled together, toward a condition of gel, by their surface tensions. This is because surface tensions pull all glue like substances together. Colloids are also, conversley, pulled apart, toward a condition called sol, by their electrical charges. This is because their electrical charges are similar, and similar electrical charges always repel each other. In the equilbrium between gel and sol, the collodial suspension maintains its continuity and life continues. Move the suspension too far toward gel, or too far toward sol, and life ends. 

Any chemical that gets into the brain, changes the gel-sol balance, and [consciousness](Consciousness.md) is accordingly influenced. Thus, potatoes are, like LSD, "psychedelic"‚Äîin a milder way. The changes in consciousness when one moves from vegetarian diet to an omnivorous diet, or vice versa, are also "psychedelic." Since [What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves](What%20the%20Thinker%20thinks,%20the%20Prover%20proves.md), all of our ideas are psychedelic. Even without experimenting with diet or drugs, what ever you think you should see, you will see‚Äîunless it is physically impossible in this universe.
