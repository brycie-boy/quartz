## Babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left

Not only [the brain hemispheres are more independent in babies and children](The%20brain%20hemispheres%20are%20more%20independent%20in%20babies%20and%20children.md), they are also more reliant on the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), which matures earlier than the left, and it may be that it is the increasing importance of [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) function with age that necessitates the separation, in both hemispheres' interests, of their realms of activity. The Berlin Wall that meets this need would be the increasingly efficient [corpus callosum](Corpus%20callosum.md).
