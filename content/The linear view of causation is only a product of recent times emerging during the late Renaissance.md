## The linear view of causation is only a product of recent times emerging during the late Renaissance

Some rough idea of causality has probably been around since the dawn of human intellgence, but the classic Western concept of¬†linear causation¬†in which an action by one thing is said to cause a change in one other thing only emerged after Aristotelian either/or logic was combined with experimental method during the late Renaissance. The first doubts of this causality began among quantum physicists around the 1920s. Now, since non-local effects violate this model of causality, physicists are becoming accustomed to thinking in terms of two kinds of priciples, the causal (local) and the acasual (non-local). [Dependent Origination](Dependent%20Origination.md) can also be contrasted with classic Western causation. [Dependent Origination](Dependent%20Origination.md) instead views the change as being caused by many factors, not just one or even a few.
