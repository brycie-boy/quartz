## Each thing is interlinked to the rest of the Universe in various ways we do not yet know

As the doctrine of [Dependent Origination](Dependent%20Origination.md) teaches, all things are interconnected with everything else. Nature is thus a continuous phenomenon. Although we do not know in all cases the way in which things are connected. For example, human consciousness depends on the properties of protoplasm, the existence of which depends on innumerable physical conditions peculiar to this planet; and this planet is determined by the mechanical balance of the whole universe of matter. We may then say that our consciousness is causally connected with the remotest galaxies; yet we do not know even how it arises from-or with-the molecular changes in the [brain](Brain.md).

Science enables us to take advantage of the continuity of Nature by the empirical application of certain principles whose interplay involves different orders of idea, connected with each other in a way beyond our present comprehension. We are able to light cities by rule-of-thumb methods. We do not know what consciousness is, or how it is connected with muscular action; what electricity is or how it is connected with the machines that generate it; and our methods depend on calculations involving mathematical ideas which have no correspondence in the Universe as we know it.
