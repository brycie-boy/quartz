## The low social capital that comes with income inequality can lead to more stress and poor health

[Income inequality is a strong predictor of poor health because it is about being made to feel poor](Income%20inequality%20is%20a%20strong%20predictor%20of%20poor%20health%20because%20it%20is%20about%20being%20made%20to%20feel%20poor.md). Income inequality and feeling poor could give rise to bad health through a number of routes. One, pioneered by [Ichiro Kawachi]() of Harvard University, focuses on how income inequality makes for a psychologically crappier, more stressful life for everyone. He draws heavily upon a concept in sociology called ‚Äú[social capital](Social%20capital.md).‚Äù 

Obviously, ‚Äú[social capital](Social%20capital.md)‚Äù can be measured in a lot of ways and is still evolving as a hard-nosed measure, but, broadly, it incorporates elements of trust, reciprocity, lack of hostility, heavy participation in organizations for a common good (ranging from achieving fun‚Äîa bowling league‚Äîto more serious things‚Äîtenant organizations or a union) and those organizations accomplishing something. Most studies get at it with two measures: how people answer a question like, ‚ÄúDo you think most people would try to take advantage of you if they got a chance, or would they try to be fair?‚Äù and how many organizations people belong to. Measures like those tell you that on the levels of states, provinces, cities, and neighborhoods, low [social capital](Social%20capital.md) tends to mean poor health, poor self-reported health, and high mortality rates.
