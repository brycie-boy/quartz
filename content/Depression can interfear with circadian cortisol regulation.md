## Depression can interfear with circadian cortisol regulation

[Depressed](Depression.md) people have problems with circadian [cortisol](Cortisol.md) regulation. Normally, [cortisol](Cortisol.md) goes up in the morning before you wake up to help you mobilize [glucose](), raise your blood pressure, and get ready for the day. By the time nighttime arrives, [cortisol](Cortisol.md) levels are in the sewer. This [circadian rhythm]() of [cortisol](Cortisol.md) is missing in [depressed](Depression.md) subjects: their [cortisol](Cortisol.md) is always up and you can‚Äôt even suppress it with medications.
