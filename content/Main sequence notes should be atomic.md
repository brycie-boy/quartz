## Main sequence notes should be atomic  #‚è≥

Its best to write notes that are about one specific thing, but which, as much as possible, capture the entirety of that thing. This way it is easier to make connections across other notes. If a note is too broad, then you might not notice when you encounter some new idea about one of the notions contained within. If a note is too fragmented, then you also fragment your link network, which may make it harder to see certain connections ([Main sequence notes should be densely linked](Main%20sequence%20notes%20should%20be%20densely%20linked.md)).
