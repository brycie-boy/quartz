## The diversity of mental states when the default mode network inactive may lead to more creative solutions to problems # 

One way to think about the blooming of mental states when [[distinct brain networks are able to communicate and connect more openly when the default mode network is inactive]] is that it temporarily boosts the sheer amount of diversity in our mental life. If problem solving is anything like evolutionary adaptation, the more possibilities the mind has at its disposal, the more creative its solutions will be. In this sense, [[high-entropy state]]s in the [[brain]] are a bit like variation in evolution: it supplies the diversity of raw materials on which selection can then operate to solve problems and bring novelty into the world. If, as so many artists and scientists have testified, the [[psychedelic]] experience is an aid to creativity‚Äîto thinking ‚Äúoutside the box‚Äù‚Äîthis model might help explain why that is the case. Maybe the problem with ‚Äúthe box‚Äù is that it is singular.
