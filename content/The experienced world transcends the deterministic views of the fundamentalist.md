## The experienced world transcends the deterministic views of the fundamentalist

[The left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20be%20stubbornly%20certain,%20whereas%20the%20right%20acknowledges%20ambiguity%20and%20is%20always%20uncertain.md). In the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)s "real" universe, all things are determined, including us and our thoughts. In the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)s experienced world, things come and go incessantly and sometimes so fast that we can never know why, causal models only fit some of experience. There is a sense of flow, process, evolution, and growth, as the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) sees: [the right hemisphere is better with dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20better%20with%20dealing%20with%20fluidity%20and%20motion,%20whereas%20the%20left%20is%20better%20at%20dealing%20with%20things%20in%20stasis.md). In this experienced world, and not abstract theory, we are faced with by apparent decisions continually. We make them and we experience the sense of choice as we do. We can never know how much such choice is "real" absolutely, but since we can never know anything else absolutely ([each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty](Each%20perception%20that%20we%20make%20is%20best%20considered%20to%20be%20a%20gamble%20rather%20than%20a%20certainty.md)), we make do on probabilities.
