## The experienced world transcends the deterministic views of the fundamentalist

[The left hemisphere prioritizes theory over experience](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20theory%20over%20experience.md), and [the left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20be%20stubbornly%20certain,%20whereas%20the%20right%20acknowledges%20ambiguity%20and%20is%20always%20uncertain.md). In the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)s "real" universe, all things are determined, including us and our thoughts. In the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)s experienced world, things come and go incessantly and sometimes so fast that we can never know why, causal models only fit some of experience. There is a sense of flow, process, evolution, and growth. [The left hemisphere filters experience into an abstract representation, while the right sees things without preconceptions](The%20left%20hemisphere%20filters%20experience%20into%20an%20abstract%20representation,%20while%20the%20right%20sees%20things%20without%20preconceptions.md). In the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)s experienced world, and not abstract theory, we are faced with by apparent decisions continually. We make them and we experience the sense of choice as we do. We can never know how much such choice is "real" absolutely, but since we can never know anything else absolutely ([each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty](Each%20perception%20that%20we%20make%20is%20best%20considered%20to%20be%20a%20gamble%20rather%20than%20a%20certainty.md)), we make do on probabilities. The experienced world gives us a sense of [mastery](Mastery.md).
