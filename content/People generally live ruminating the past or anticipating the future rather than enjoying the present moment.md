## People generally live ruminating the past or anticipating the future rather than enjoying the present moment # 

People generally do not live [[Mindfulness|mindfully]] in the present moment. There [[default mode network]] is either in the past or in the future. Though they seem to be doing something here and now, they live somewhere else in their mind, that is, in imaginary problems and worries, usually in the memories of the past or in desires and speculations about the future. These [[mental simulations evolved to allow us to anticipate potential outcomes and make the best approach]], but [[our capacity to imagine potential outcomes activates the dopamine anticipation response]]. Thus, they do not live in, nor do they enjoy, what they do at the moment. So they are unhappy and discontented with the present moment, with the work at hand, and naturally they cannot give themselves fully to what they appear to be doing.

When asked why his disciples, who lived a simple and quiet life with only one meal a day, were so radiant, [[the Buddha]] replied: ‚ÄòThey do not repent the past, nor do they brood over the future. They live in the present. Therefore they are radiant. By brooding over the future and repenting the past, fools dry up like green reeds cut down (in the sun).‚Äô
