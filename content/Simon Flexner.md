## Simon Flexner  # 

Simon Flexner was a physician, scientist, asministrator, and professor of experiemental pathology at the University of Pennsylvania. His brother, [[Abraham Flexner|Abraham]], made enough money as an educator to send him back to medical school, and afterward urged him to move on to postgraduate work at Johns Hopkins. [[Johns Hopkins medical school adopted the German educational structure in the late 19th century in an attempt to establish itself as a beacon of evidence-based medicine and science]], so Simon was also indoctrinated into the German system and received training to become a pathologist, bacteriologist, and researcher. His mentor was the iconic Canadian physician and chairman of medicine [[Sir William Osler]], the creator of the residency program system for young physician trainees (note the German hierarchical paradigm here as well). Simon was a favored son, and Osler eventually secured him a faculty appointment in pathology at the University of Pennsylvania.
