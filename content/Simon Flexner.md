## Simon Flexner

Simon Flexner was a physician, scientist, asministrator, and professor of experiemental pathology at the University of Pennsylvania. His brother, [Abraham](Abraham%20Flexner.md), made enough money as an educator to send him back to medical school, and afterward urged him to move on to postgraduate work at Johns Hopkins. [Johns Hopkins medical school adopted the German educational structure in the late 19th century in an attempt to establish itself as a beacon of evidence-based medicine and science](Johns%20Hopkins%20medical%20school%20adopted%20the%20German%20educational%20structure%20in%20the%20late%2019th%20century%20in%20an%20attempt%20to%20establish%20itself%20as%20a%20beacon%20of%20evidence-based%20medicine%20and%20science.md), so Simon was also indoctrinated into the German system and received training to become a pathologist, bacteriologist, and researcher. His mentor was the iconic Canadian physician and chairman of medicine [Sir William Osler](), the creator of the residency program system for young physician trainees (note the German hierarchical paradigm here as well). Simon was a favored son, and Osler eventually secured him a faculty appointment in pathology at the University of Pennsylvania.
