## To really address the poor health of the poor, we would have to uproot the stressors involved in low rank rather than give people more money # 

[[Areas in America with income inequality as low as in Canada still have more stress and poor health because of less available social capital]]. This is pretty depressing stuff, given its implications. [[Nancy Adler]], writing around the time when universal health insurance first became a front-page issue (as was the question of whether Hillary‚Äôs hairstyle made her a more or less effective advocate for it), concluded that such universal coverage would ‚Äúhave a minor impact on SES-related inequalities in health.‚Äù Her conclusion is anything but reactionary. Instead, it says that if you want to change the SES gradient, it‚Äôs going to take something a whole lot bigger than rigging up insurance so that everyone can drop in regularly on a friendly small-town doc out of Norman Rockwell. Poverty, and the poor health of the poor, is about much more than simply not having enough money. It‚Äôs about the [[stressor]]s caused in a society that tolerates leaving so many of its members so far behind.
