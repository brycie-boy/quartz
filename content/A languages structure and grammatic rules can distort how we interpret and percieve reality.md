## A languages structure and grammatic rules can distort how we interpret and percieve reality  #üß†

In considering that [language can be seen as a kind of metaphor](Language%20can%20be%20seen%20as%20a%20kind%20of%20metaphor.md), more subtle issues arise when we consider the structure of a system of metaphors interlinked with the grammatical rules of a language. [Descartes](), who tried to doubt everything, or at least says he tried, found that he could not doubt the proposition "i think therefor i am."  He could not doubt that proposition because he only knew Indo-European languages, and It is an Indo-European linguistic convention that a verb must be preceded by a substanative noun‚Äîthat an action must be attributed to some allegedly isolated and [reified](Reification.md) actor. It is this convention that is the reason why we still say "*it* is raining" even though we no longer believe in Zeus or any other rain god and would be hard put to say what else "*it*" might refer to.

These linguistic structural factors may explain some of the great internal conflicts within philosophy. If [Descartes]() were to think in a French that was even more latinate than todays, he would percieve "un pomme grosse et rouge" and conclude that the mind starts with general ideas and then determines paticulars. Whereas [John Locke](), thinking in english, would percieve an object such as "a big red apple" and deduct that the mind starts from particulars and then assembles general ideas.
