## The existential vacuum has spread through humanity due to the lack of instincts to help guide human behavior # 

The [[existential vacuum]] is a widespread phenomenon of the twentieth century. This is understandable; it may be due to a twofold loss which humanity has had to undergo since they truly became human being. At the beginning of human history, man lost some of the basic animal instincts in which an animal’s behavior is embedded and by which it is secured. Such security, like Paradise, is closed to man forever; man has to make choices.
