*“As above. So below.”*

Eventually my [☀️ Main-Sequence Note](Main-Sequence%20Note)s must leave [🔮 The Cosmos](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Cosmos.md) and burst into the universe of others. Using my output as fertilizer, they too will create their own stars, and the [time-binding](Time-binding.md) cycle repeats. My output process aligns [☯️ The Flow](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Flow.md)s goal of [non-forcing](Non-forcing.md) in that, when compiling this work, [the Flow can help prevent the cognitive burden of starting a writing project with a blank page](The%20Flow%20can%20help%20prevent%20the%20cognitive%20burden%20of%20starting%20a%20writing%20project%20with%20a%20blank%20page.md).
