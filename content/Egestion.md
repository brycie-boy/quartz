# 📤 Egestion

_“As above. So below.”_

- This is the [[yang]] phase of [[The Flow]]. 
- light may shine out
- Light, stable
- I am active and productive in that distributing my work

Eventually my [☀️ Main-Sequence Note](Main-Sequence%20Note)s must leave [🔮 The Cosmos](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Cosmos.md) and burst into the universe of others. Using my output as fertilizer, they too will create their own stars, and the [[time-binding]] cycle repeats. My output process aligns [☯️ The Flow](🔮%20The%20Cosmos/The%20Flow.md)s goal of [[non-forcing]] in that, when compiling this work, [[the Flow can help prevent the cognitive burden of starting a writing project with a blank page]].
