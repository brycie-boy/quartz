## The right hemisphere is able to access and hold larger quantities of information

[Novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar](Novel%20experience%20and%20information%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20right%20hemisphere,%20and%20is%20handled%20by%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20once%20it%20becomes%20familiar.md), such experiences trigger a [norepinephrine](Norepinephrine.md) release. Most [neuron](Neuron.md)s fatigue, that is to say they cease to respond when continuously stimulated. These [norepinephrine](Norepinephrine.md) [neuron](Neuron.md)s do not fatigue, however, but maintain their condition of excitation, so that exploratory attention is held open across a greater expanse of both space and time. The range of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is further increased by the fact that it has a longer [working memory](Working%20memory.md), and so is able both to access more information and hold it together at any one time for longer. It is capable of bearing more information in mind and doing so over longer periods, with greater specificity (which also means less susceptibility to degradation over time by memory).
