## Norepinephrine  # 

Norepinephrine is an organic chemical in the [[catecholamine]] family that functions in the brain and body as both a [[hormone]] and [[neurotransmitter]]. The general function of norepinephrine is to mobilize the brain and body for action. Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the fight-or-flight [[sympathetic nervous system]] response. In the [[brain]], norepinephrine increases arousal and alertness, promotes vigilance, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, and focuses attention; it also increases restlessness and anxiety. Norepinephrine also boosts the signal quality of [[Synapse|synaptic]] transmission. Unlike most [[neuron]]s, norepinephrine [[neuron]]s do not fatigue and maintain their condition of excitation.
