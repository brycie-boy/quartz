## The fifth stage of perception #🧠 

The fifth stage of perception (see [[the fourth stage of perception]]) is always verbal or symbolic and hence is coded into the pre-existing structure of whatever language systems the [[left hemisphere]] has been previously taught. This process is not one of linear reaction but of [[synergy|synergetic]] [[transaction]]. This finished product is thus a [[Neurosemantics|neurosemantic]] construct, a kind of metaphor. Thus [[language can be seen as a kind of metaphor]].
