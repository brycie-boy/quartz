## The limbic system imprints through breastfeeding # 

Any mammal hooks the [[limbic system]] to the first [[imprint]]ed bio-survival object: the teat. Bio-survival and orality are deeply blended in all mammals, including domesticated primates. This is why, despite the Cancer Terror, an estimated 30,000,000 Americans still smoke cigarettes ... Others chew gum, bite their fingernails, gnaw their knuckles, scrunch pencil stubs, eat more than they need. Some chew their lips, gobble tranks and uppers, even munch their mustaches.
