## The limbic system imprints through breastfeeding

Any mammal hooks the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) to the first [imprint](Imprint.md)ed bio-survival object: the teat. Bio-survival and orality are deeply blended in all mammals, including domesticated primates. This is why, despite the Cancer Terror, an estimated 30,000,000 Americans still smoke cigarettes¬†... Others chew gum, bite their fingernails, gnaw their knuckles, scrunch pencil stubs, eat more than they need. Some chew their lips, gobble tranks and uppers, even munch their mustaches.
