# The Web Archetype

_The [Cosmic Web](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_filament)_

I decided to use the Cosmic Web as a reoccurring theme in my vault as it represents the interconnected web like nature of [[the Cosmos]], while also fitting into the Cosmic theme. It also resembles the graph view in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the program that I use to write these notes in. Neural networks are another manifestation of this pattern. [[The Cosmos]] physically resides within my own neural network. I like to think of the graph as a visual representation of my neural networks.

Another interesting fact is that, according to mycologist [[Paul Stamets]] in his Mycelium Running, “in string theory … astrophysicists theorize that the most energy-conserving forms in the universe will be organized as threads of matterenergy.” This would be in line with the [[non-forcing]] principle of [[The Flow]]. He unfortunately did not include a citation for this and I would appreciate if someone could help me verify it as I have not been able to. The mycology context is that “The arrangement of these strings resembles the architecture of mycelium.” Neural networks also follow [[non-forcing]]. [[Habits develop to help the brain conserve energy]].

The World Wide Web also happens to resemble this pattern. Stamets continues: “When the Internet was designed, its weblike structure maximized the pooling of data and computational power while minimizing critical points upon which the system is dependent.” The internet happens to be one of the primary sources that contribute to [[Ingestion]].

_The Internet_

Stamets believes “the structure of the Internet is simply an archetypal form, the inevitable consequence of a previously proven evolutionary model, which is also seen in the human brain; diagrams of computer networks bear resemblance to both mycelium and neurological arrays in the mammalian brain”
