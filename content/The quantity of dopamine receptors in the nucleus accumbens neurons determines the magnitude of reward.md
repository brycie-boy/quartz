## The quantity of dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens neurons determines the magnitude of reward  #üß†

After [dopamine](Dopamine.md) is released from the [ventral tegmental area](Ventral%20tegmental%20area.md)s [axon](Axon.md)al terminals, it travels across the [synapse](Synapse.md), where it binds to a [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md) on the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) [neuron](Neuron.md)s and exites it, causing the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) to fire, releasing [opioid peptide](Opioid%20peptide.md)s and generating reward. The number of [receptor](Receptor.md)s determines the magnitude of the reward. More functional [dopamine](Dopamine.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s means a higher chance that any given [dopamine](Dopamine.md) molecule will find a [receptor](Receptor.md) to bind to, and therefore more reward signaling even in the face of less [dopamine](Dopamine.md) released. 

But if the number of [receptor](Receptor.md)s is reduced, then each [dopamine](Dopamine.md) molecule has less of a chance to find a [receptor](Receptor.md) to bind to, and therefor will generate less reward. Also, [there must be a balanced amount of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway to prevent lethargy or irritablility](There%20must%20be%20a%20balanced%20amount%20of%20dopamine%20in%20the%20mesolimbic%20pathway%20to%20prevent%20lethargy%20or%20irritablility.md), and things that change [receptor](Receptor.md) number will influence you're [dopamine](Dopamine.md) balance.
