## The devine abodes #‚è≥

The practice of meditation is not only the heart of the path to [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) but is a also a source of [merit](Merit.md). Meditation practices, even those that do not lead directy to [insight](Insight.md), help purify the grosser levels of mental defilement and uncover deeper demensions of the minds purity and radiance. There are meditations on a set of four [virtues](Virtue%20ethics.md) that produces mundane [merit](Merit.md) refered to by [the Buddha]() as the "devine abodes." These include:

* [loving-kindness](Loving-kindness.md)
* [compassion](Compassion.md)
* [altruistic joy](Altruistic%20joy.md)
* [equanimity](Equanimity.md)

The most fruitful of these being [loving-kindness](Loving-kindness.md). 

These meditations are said to bring [rebirth](Rebirth.md) in the [Brahma World](). While the Brahmins regarded the [Brahma World]() as the highest attainment, for [the Buddha]() it was just one exhalted sphere of [rebirth](Rebirth.md).
