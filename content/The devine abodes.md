## The devine abodes #‚è≥ 

The practice of meditation is not only the heart of the path to [[Nibbana]] but is a also a source of [[merit]]. Meditation practices, even those that do not lead directy to [[insight]], help purify the grosser levels of mental defilement and uncover deeper demensions of the minds purity and radiance. There are meditations on a set of four [[Virtue ethics|virtues]] that produces mundane [[merit]] refered to by [[the Buddha]] as the "devine abodes." These include:

- [[loving-kindness]]
- [[compassion]]
- [[altruistic joy]]
- [[equanimity]]

The most fruitful of these being [[loving-kindness]]. 

These meditations are said to bring [[rebirth]] in the [[Brahma World]]. While the Brahmins regarded the [[Brahma World]] as the highest attainment, for [[the Buddha]] it was just one exhalted sphere of [[rebirth]].
