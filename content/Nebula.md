*“And the earth was without form and void”*

Nebulas are what i call my inbox notes. Nebulas consist of 2 stages:

* **💥 Supernova**
  
  The first stage is the supernova stage. These are what i call my unprocessed inbox notes. In this stage, all of the annotations i collect during [Ingestion](Ingestion.md) are copied onto an inbox scrap note. These annotations are of little informational value; they are atomized, scattered, and unrelated (hence the gas analogies). This is fine. Think of it as a reminder saying "hey, look at this passage." When processing these annotations you'll want to be able to see the big picture and see clusters of ideas. I cluster annotations by copying the annotations from the inbox scrap into an actual inbox note and sort them into clusters as I go through them. Clusters do not have to follow the structure of the original source. Annotations can be clustered in what ever way makes sense to you. These clusters, when organized, are then written into [⛅️ Proto Note](Proto%20Note)s.

* **☁️ Nebula**
  
  The second stage is the nebula stage. These refer to my processed inbox notes. When the chaos of the supernova subsides, and gravity has finally condensed all of the scattered atomized annotations into [☀️ Main-Sequence Note](Main-Sequence%20Note)s, then the inbox note has been fully processed and thus receives nebula status.
