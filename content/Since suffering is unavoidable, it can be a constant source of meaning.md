## Since suffering is an unavoidable aspect of life, it can be a constant source of meaning # 

[[We can find meaning in uncontrollable suffering by taking it as a challenge to triumph and change our attitudes]]. Although there are negative situations in which one is cut off from the opportunity to do one’s work or to enjoy one’s life, what never can be ruled out is the unavoidability of suffering. [[Finding meaning in our suffering can counter act the tendency instilled in us by conventional psychiatry to be ashamed of our unhappiness]]. In accepting this challenge to suffer bravely, life has a meaning up to the last moment, and it retains this meaning literally to the end. In other words, life’s meaning is an unconditional one, for it even includes the potential meaning of unavoidable suffering.
