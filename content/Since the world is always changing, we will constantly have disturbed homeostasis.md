## Since the world is always changing, we will constantly have disturbed homeostasis

Occasionally, threat signals do stop for a while‚Äîjust as long as every system stays in balance. But since the world is [impermanent](Impermanence.md) always changing, there are endless disturbances in the [homeostasis](Homeostasis.md) of your body and mind, and thus potentially a constant [stress-response](Stress-response.md). The regulators of the systems of your life, from the molecular bottom all the way up to the interpersonal top, must keep trying to impose static order on inherently unstable processes. Everything changes. That‚Äôs the universal nature of outer reality and inner experience. Therefore, there‚Äôs no end to disturbed [homeostasis](Homeostasis.md) as long as you live. But to help you survive, your [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) keeps trying to stop the river, struggling to hold dynamic systems in place, to find fixed patterns in this variable world, and to construct permanent plans for changing conditions. [The right hemisphere is better at dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20better%20at%20dealing%20with%20fluidity%20and%20motion,%20whereas%20the%20left%20is%20better%20at%20dealing%20with%20things%20in%20stasis.md). Consequently, your [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is forever chasing after the moment that has just passed, trying to understand and control it.
