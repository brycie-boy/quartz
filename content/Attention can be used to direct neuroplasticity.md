## Attention can be used to direct neuroplasticity

* [Neural activity changes in accordance with mental activity](Neural%20activity%20changes%20in%20accordance%20with%20mental%20activity.md)
* Since your brain learns mainly from what you attend to, mindfulness is the doorway to taking in good experiences and making them a part of yourself
* It learns through forming new circuits and strengthening or weakening existing ones. And it selects whatever experience has taught it to value
* Mindfulness leads to new learning—since attention shapes neural circuits—and draws upon past learning to develop a steadier and more concentrated awareness
