## Attention can be used to direct neuroplasticity  # 

- [[Neural activity changes in accordance with mental activity]]
- Since your brain learns mainly from what you attend to, mindfulness is the doorway to taking in good experiences and making them a part of yourself
- It learns through forming new circuits and strengthening or weakening existing ones. And it selects whatever experience has taught it to value
- Mindfulness leads to new learning—since attention shapes neural circuits—and draws upon past learning to develop a steadier and more concentrated awareness
