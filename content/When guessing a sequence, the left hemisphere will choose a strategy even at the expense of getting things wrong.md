## When guessing a sequence, the left hemisphere will choose a strategy even at the expense of getting things wrong # 

[[The left hemisphere will confabulate explanations for things it doesn't know and seems completely convinced of them]]. The fact is that this [[habit]] is far from harmless: it leads the [[left hemisphere]] to make poor inferences and some mistaken choices. In one experiment by [[Micheal Gazzaniga]]'s colleagues, split-[[brain]] subjects were asked to guess which color, red or green, was going to be displayed next, in a series where there were obviously (four times) more green than red. Instead of spotting that the way to get the highest score is to choose green every time (the [[right hemisphere]]'s strategy), leading to a score of 80 per cent, the [[left hemisphere]] chose green at random, but about four times more often than red, producing a score of little better than chance. The problem here, as subsequent research has illuminated, is that the [[left hemisphere]] develops a rule‚Äîa rule that is, however, wrong.
