## When guessing a sequence, the left hemisphere will choose a strategy even at the expense of getting things wrong

[The left hemisphere will confabulate explanations for things it doesn't know and seems completely convinced of them](The%20left%20hemisphere%20will%20confabulate%20explanations%20for%20things%20it%20doesn't%20know%20and%20seems%20completely%20convinced%20of%20them.md). The fact is that this [habit](Habit.md) is far from harmless: it leads the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) to make poor inferences and some mistaken choices. In one experiment by [Micheal Gazzaniga]()'s colleagues, split-[brain](Brain.md) subjects were asked to guess which color, red or green, was going to be displayed next, in a series where there were obviously (four times) more green than red. Instead of spotting that the way to get the highest score is to choose green every time (the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s strategy), leading to a score of 80 per cent, the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) chose green at random, but about four times more often than red, producing a score of little better than chance. The problem here, as subsequent research has illuminated, is that the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) develops a rule‚Äîa rule that is, however, wrong.
