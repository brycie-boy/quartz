## Operant conditioning  #🧠

Operant [conditioning](Conditioning.md) is a type of associative learning process through which the strength of a behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment. Operant conditioning involves learning to approach stimuli because we have previously associated it with pleasant [feeling](Feeling.md)s (reward) and learning avoid stimuli because we have previously associated it with painful [feeling](Feeling.md)s (punishment). These approach and avoidance behaviors are known as positive and negative reinforcement.
