## In the late 80s and 90s, new SSRIs began to sell widely and rapidly

[During the 70s, psychiatric drugs became much less risky and were beginning to be offered to the wider temporarily distressed public](During%20the%2070s,%20psychiatric%20drugs%20became%20much%20less%20risky%20and%20were%20beginning%20to%20be%20offered%20to%20the%20wider%20temporarily%20distressed%20public.md). Next came the inexorable march of the [SSRI]() [antidepressant]()s in the late 1980s and early 1990s‚Äîa classic marketing success story. [Prozac]() became a knockout best seller, even spawning a best-selling book by a psychiatrist touting its value not only as an antidepressant but also as a cosmetic drug that could make you better than well. Every year or two thereafter, a new [SSRI]() would appear‚ÄîZoloft, Paxil, Celexa‚Äîand each would also in turn become a runaway best seller. The marketing of these easy-to-use drugs was closely tied to the marketing of what were (according to the drug companies) easy-to-make psychiatric diagnoses.

Soon the SSRIs were also prescribed for panic disorder, [generalized anxiety](), social phobia, [OCD](), [PTSD](), eating disorders, premature ejaculation, and compulsive gambling, and as a general pick-me-up. Sure, there were side effects‚Äîsome frequent (like reduced sexuality); some rare but dangerous (like agitation, suicidality, and violence). But [SSRI]()s fit so neatly into everyday life that 20 percent of women now take them. Diagnostic inflation will always be an inevitable consequence of an aggressively marketed, easy-to-take pill.
