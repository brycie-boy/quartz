## Learning outside of school involves active doing and purpose, whereas learning in school involves abstracted standardized outcomes

Much of the learning that goes on outside school can be seen through the lens of a [community of practice](Community%20of%20practice.md). Students learn through doing, and their learning is enmeshed with its purpose. The two are never separated. [People become experts in something by actively doing it rather than by preparing for it](People%20become%20experts%20in%20something%20by%20actively%20doing%20it%20rather%20than%20by%20preparing%20for%20it.md), and [experts have purpose and context in what they learn because they have chosen to learn it](Experts%20have%20purpose%20and%20context%20in%20what%20they%20learn%20because%20they%20have%20chosen%20to%20learn%20it.md). In the institution of school, the child‚Äôs culture and internal world hardly matter unless they interfere with the instructional process. In fact, many early schools, particularly in America and Australia, were deliberately developed in order to wipe out indigenous cultures. School introduces a specific set of culturally specific standardized outcomes and prioritizes them above all else.
