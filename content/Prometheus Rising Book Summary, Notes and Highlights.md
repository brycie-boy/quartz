- [[Anyone who can scare people enough can sell any semantic map that seems to give them relief]]
- [[Each scientific revolution has been shown to take one full generation to turn over the old world view]]
- [[Proselytizing is generally ignored because it puts you one-up on the person preached at]]
- [[The Semantic Circuit is resposible for our conception and experience of time]]
