## Representationalism #🧠

Representationalism is the philosophical position that our conscious experience is not of an objective world but of a subjective internal representation or mental simulation of the world shaped by [predictive coding](Predictive%20coding.md). Representationalists would deny that "first-hand knowledge" is a coherent concept, since knowledge is always via some means, and argue instead that our ideas of the world are interpretations of sensory input derived from an external world ([Etic Reality](Etic%20Reality.md)) that is real (contra [Idolatry](Idolatry.md)).
