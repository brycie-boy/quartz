## Mind  #‚è≥

Mind, and its objective sphere, phenomena, are the sixth pair of the [six sense bases](Six%20sense%20bases.md). What the first five of the [six sense bases](Six%20sense%20bases.md) signify is obvious enough, but the sixth pair may require some elaboration. The mind base comprises all six types of consciousness arisen from [sense impression](Sense%20impression.md) and is also the passive flow of [consciousness](Consciousness.md) from which active conceptual [consciousness](Consciousness.md) emerges. All entities not cognized through the other sense bases constitute the phenomena base. The phenomena base then includes the other three mental aggregates‚Äî[feeling](Feeling.md), [perception](Perception.md), and [volitional formation](Volitional%20formation.md)s‚Äîas well as "mental objects" such as those apprehended by introspection, imagination, and reflection.
