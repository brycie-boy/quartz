## Panpsychism

Panpsychism is a type of [eternalism](Eternalism.md) which states that mind or [consciousness](Consciousness.md) is the fundamental ground of reality. Panpsychists posit that the type of mentality we know through our own experience is present, in some form, in a wide range of natural bodies. To pansychists, our brains simply act as a sort of receiver and refiner of this ubiquitous [consciousness](Consciousness.md).
