Proto Note's are the second stage of [☁️ The Stellar Nursery](The%20Stellar%20Nursery). As the dust and gas (annotations) from the [☁️ Nebula](Nebula) condenses, clear and cohesive ideas begin to emerge from the clouds and take shape. But these ideas are still under development. These incomplete notes are what I refer to as Proto Notes. The goal the Proto Note is to eventually develop into a  [☀️ Main-Sequence Note](Main-Sequence%20Note). This development process, which I have adopted from [Andy Matushak](), is as follows:

1. **Write broad notes** which capture the big ideas of the clusters within your [☁️ Nebula](Nebula)s

1. **Write finer grained notes:** look through the individual scraps of that cluster. Write notes that capture more nuanced atomic ideas within that cluster.

1. **Connect:** Search for relevant past notes which relate to these new notes. Link, merge,  and revise as necessary to represent your new synthesized conception of those ideas

1. **Revise:** Return to the broad notes and improve your summary based on what you've learned from writing the detailed notes and the details you unpacked if its possible to do so without muddying their focus. Remove detailed notes that are no longer necessary. Update others based on what you've learned writing your updated broad note if appropriate.
