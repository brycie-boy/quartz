## To be innovative, we must embrace our uniqueness #üß†

[Humanities greatest thinkers are those who defied groupthink and authority bias and followed their own judgement](Humanities%20greatest%20thinkers%20are%20those%20who%20defied%20groupthink%20and%20authority%20bias%20and%20followed%20their%20own%20judgement.md). [Every individual has their own unique character and purpose by design of the universe](Every%20individual%20has%20their%20own%20unique%20character%20and%20purpose%20by%20design%20of%20the%20universe.md). 

Many people have a moment in their lives where they recognize that envy and imitation is destructive, and that we must embrace our unique selves. 

Also, though the Universe is full of good, no reward can be reaped but through the work one does with the unique environment they've been given. Each person has to do their own work to discover themselves and the value that is in the world.

Every person is indeed unique, but we only half express ourselves and find shame in our uniqueness. Short term, this may *seem* to be of our benefit, but new insights will not occur to those who are not brave enough to embrace what makes them unique. And if we lose our originality entirely; all creativity ceases.
