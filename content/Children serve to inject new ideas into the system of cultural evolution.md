## Children serve to inject new ideas into the system of cultural evolution #üß† 

Since [[the evolution of the human brain lead to our brains being immature at birth]], we have the longest childhood of any species and [[much of the growth of the human brain occurs after birth]]. Also, [[babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left]]. This extended period of learning and exploration is what‚Äôs distinctive about us. Childhood is, as Dr. [[Alison Gopnik]] put it, the research and development stage of the species, concerned exclusively with learning and exploring. We adults are production and marketing.

- [[Novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]]
- [[The global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]]
    - dominance for exploratory attentional movements
    - the left hemisphere assists in focussed grasping of what has already been prioritized

Each generation of children confronts a new unique environment, and their [[brain]]s are particularly good at learning and thriving in that environment. Also, [[children and babies act independently without caring what others will think]]. Childhood is the species‚Äô way of injecting noise into the system of cultural evolution.

The child‚Äôs [[brain]] is extremely plastic, good for learning, not accomplishing‚Äîbetter for exploring rather than exploiting. It also has many more neural connections than the adult [[brain]]. But [[the brain selects for the brain circuits that are most utilized throughout development]]. Then the [[default mode network]] and [[left hemisphere]] come online, and [[the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]].
