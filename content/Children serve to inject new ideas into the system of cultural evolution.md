## Children serve to inject new ideas into the system of cultural evolution

Because [the evolution of the human brain lead to our brains being immature at birth](The%20evolution%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20lead%20to%20our%20brains%20being%20immature%20at%20birth.md), we have the longest childhood of any species and [much of the growth of the human brain occurs after birth](Much%20of%20the%20growth%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20occurs%20after%20birth.md). This extended period of learning and exploration is what‚Äôs distinctive about us. Childhood is, as Dr. [Alison Gopnik]() put it, the research and development stage of the species, concerned exclusively with learning and exploring. We adults are production and marketing.

Each generation of children confronts a new unique environment, and their [brain](Brain.md)s are particularly good at learning and thriving in that environment. Think of the children of immigrants, or four-year-olds confronted with an iPhone. Children don‚Äôt invent these new tools, they don‚Äôt create the new environment, but in every generation they build the kind of [brain](Brain.md) that can best thrive in it. Also, [Children, babies, and animals act independently without caring what others will think](Children,%20babies,%20and%20animals%20act%20independently%20without%20caring%20what%20others%20will%20think.md). Childhood is the species‚Äô way of injecting noise into the system of cultural evolution.

The child‚Äôs [brain](Brain.md) is extremely plastic, good for learning, not accomplishing‚Äîbetter for exploring rather than exploiting. It also has a great many more neural connections than the adult [brain](Brain.md). But [the brain selects for the brain circuits that are most utilized throughout development](The%20brain%20selects%20for%20the%20brain%20circuits%20that%20are%20most%20utilized%20throughout%20development.md). A key element of that developmental process is the suppression of [high-entropy state](High-entropy%20state.md)s, with all of its implications, both good and bad. The system cools, and [high-temperature search](High-temperature%20search.md)es become the exception rather than the rule. The [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md) and [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) come online, and [the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md). Perhaps this explains why [public schools serve to manufacture a manageable population and to put down dissent and originality](Public%20schools%20serve%20to%20manufacture%20a%20manageable%20population%20and%20to%20put%20down%20dissent%20and%20originality.md).
