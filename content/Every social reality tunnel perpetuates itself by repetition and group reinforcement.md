## Every social reality tunnel perpetuates itself by repetition and group reinforcement

[We ordinarily perceive reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments](We%20ordinarily%20perceive%20reality%20through%20subjective%20biases%20shaped%20by%20our%20craving%20and%20attachments.md). Every social [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) perpetuates itself by repetition. This is maintained half-consciously by group [reinforcement](Operant%20conditioning.md). The signals that maintain the group-reality are repeated endlessly and cheerfully, while others are edited out by selection of who gets in. 

For instance, most of us are frequently annoyed by the news paper. "News" or alleged news that we don't want to read gets printed; heretical opinions appear on the letters page, and sometimes in the columnists; politicians, of the opposite game, of course, tell the most outrageous lies, that also get printed. Today, all of this can be avoided online with data mining and personalized algorithms, because [data mining and personalized algorithms create an online experience that is increasingly tailored to our interests](Data%20mining%20and%20personalized%20algorithms%20create%20an%20online%20experience%20that%20is%20increasingly%20tailored%20to%20our%20interests.md). After a year, or maybe five years, you will have forgotten entirely all the "alien" and uncomfortable signals that once got through to you and caused you distress.

When they get together in groups, this is aided by the aforementioned group reinforcement. Everybody tells each other how reasonable the group-reality is, and how wicked and perverse are all the alien groups with alternative group-realities, thus creating [echo chamber](Echo%20chamber.md)s.
