## Mastery # 

Mastery refers to an internal [[locus of control]]. It is the belief that you can be an active agent in determining your own behavior, that you are able to change, grow, learn, and master new challenges. It’s the “I think I can” belief. [[The more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]]. In mastery, you are no longer a passive victim of your biography and simply witnessing your life unravel. It can allow for the exploration of alternative and more constructive ways of thinking about ourselves and open courses of action we had not considered because we had thought them impossible.
