## Mysticism

Mysticism refers to traditions and practices which aim at the disillusion of the sense of a separate isolated self, or [Identity view](Identity%20view.md), and to bring a sense of interconnectedness with the larger universe, or the union with an Absolute principle (i.e. [Monad](Monad.md)). This is often referred to as a mystical experience.
