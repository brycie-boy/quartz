## Mysticism  # 

Mysticism refers to traditions and practices which aim at the disillusion of the sense of a separate isolated self, or [[Identity view]], and to bring a sense of interconnectedness with the larger universe, or the union with an Absolute principle (i.e. [[Monad]]). This is often referred to as a mystical experience.
