## Mysticism

Mysticism refers to traditions and practices which aim at the disillusion of the sense of a seperate isolated self, or [Identity view](Identity%20view.md), and to bring a sense of interconnnectness with the larger universe, and union with an Absolute principle (i.e. [Nibbana](Nibbana.md)). This is often refered to as a mystical experience.
