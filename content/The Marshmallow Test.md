## The Marshmallow Test # 

The Marshmallow Test was a study on [[delayed gratification]] conducted at [[Stanford University]]  in 1972 led by psychologist [[Walter Mischel]]. In this study, a child was offered a choice between one small but immediate reward, or two small rewards if they waited for a period of time. During this time, the researcher left the child in a room with a single marshmallow for about 15 minutes and then returned. If they did not eat the marshmallow, the reward was either another marshmallow or pretzel stick, depending on the child's preference. Then they followed a sample of these participants and assessed them on diverse measures about once every decade after the original testing. In 2010, the participants reached their early to midforties, and in 2014, and the researchers are continuing to collect information from them, such as their occupational, marital, physical, financial, and [[mental health]] status.
