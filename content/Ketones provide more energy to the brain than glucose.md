## Ketones provide more energy to the brain than glucose

Due to the [brain](Brain.md)s high energy demand, the [brain](Brain.md) has to utilize the energy that is available to it, and for most people not on a keto diet, this is primarily [glucose](). However, when available, [ketone](Ketone.md)s are the preferred fuel source for the [brain](Brain.md) since they can provide more energy compared to [glucose](). In fact, the [brain](Brain.md)‚Äôs uptake of [ketone](Ketone.md)s is proportional to their availability in the blood. What is interesting to note about [ketone](Ketone.md)s versus [glucose]() metabolism is the push-pull method. [Glucose]() is pulled into the [brain](Brain.md) based on the demands of the [brain](Brain.md). However, [ketone](Ketone.md)s are pushed into the [brain](Brain.md) based on their availability in the blood. Since [ketone](Ketone.md)s provide more energy compared to [glucose](), this means that [ketone](Ketone.md)s possess the ability to provide more energy to the [brain](Brain.md) to assist in [brain](Brain.md) function.
