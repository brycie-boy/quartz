## Ketones provide more energy to the brain than glucose  # 

Due to the [[brain]]s high energy demand, the [[brain]] has to utilize the energy that is available to it, and for most people not on a keto diet, this is primarily [[glucose]]. However, when available, [[ketone]]s are the preferred fuel source for the [[brain]] since they can provide more energy compared to [[glucose]]. In fact, the [[brain]]‚Äôs uptake of [[ketone]]s is proportional to their availability in the blood. What is interesting to note about [[ketone]]s versus [[glucose]] metabolism is the push-pull method. [[Glucose]] is pulled into the [[brain]] based on the demands of the [[brain]]. However, [[ketone]]s are pushed into the [[brain]] based on their availability in the blood. Since [[ketone]]s provide more energy compared to [[glucose]], this means that [[ketone]]s possess the ability to provide more energy to the [[brain]] to assist in [[brain]] function.
