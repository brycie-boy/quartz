## Mindfulness of breathing  #‚è≥ 

[[Mindfulness]] of breathing is one of the exercises of the [[contemplation of body]].  [[The Buddha]] explains the exercise as follows.

> ... mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out. Breathing in long, he understands: ‚ÄòI breathe in long‚Äô; or breathing out long, he understands: ‚ÄòI breathe out long.‚Äô Breathing in short, he understands: ‚ÄòI breathe in short‚Äô; or breathing out short, he understands: ‚ÄòI breathe out short' ... he trains thus: ‚ÄòI will breathe in experiencing the whole body‚Äô; ... ‚ÄòI will breathe out experiencing the whole body.‚Äô ... ‚ÄòI will breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation‚Äô; ... ‚ÄòI will breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation.‚Äô ... 

[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] illumunates on this passage with some notes stating:

> ...  ‚Äúexperiencing the whole body‚Äù [means] that the meditator becomes aware of each in-breath and out-breath through its three phases of beginning, middle, and end ... The ‚Äúbodily formation‚Äù is defined as in-and-out breathing ... Thus, ... with the successful development of this practice, the meditator‚Äôs breathing becomes increasingly more quiet, tranquil, and peaceful.

The neuroscientist [[Rick Hanson]] suggests focusing the breathing in the [[diaphragm]] area. Actively working the [[diaphragm]] is particularly effective for reducing anxiety and promoting [[serenity]]. Place your hand on your stomach a couple of inches beneath the upside-down V at the center of your rib cage. Look down, breathe normally, and watch your hand. You‚Äôll probably see it move only a little bit, and sort of up and down. Leaving your hand in place, now breathe in such a way that your hand moves out and back, perpendicular to your chest. Try to breathe into your hand with real oomph, so that it travels back and forth half an inch or more with each breath. This can take some practice, but keep at it and you‚Äôll get it. Next, try diaphragm breathing without your hand so you can use this method, if you like, in public settings. Inhale as much as you can, hold that inhalation for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly while relaxing. A big inhalation really expands your lungs, requiring a big exhalation to bring the lungs back to their resting size. This stimulates the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], which is in charge of exhaling.
