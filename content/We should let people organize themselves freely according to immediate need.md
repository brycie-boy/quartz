[Communes will not limit the consumption of abundent resources, and will only do so whenever it becomes scarce](Communes%20will%20not%20limit%20the%20consumption%20of%20abundent%20resources,%20and%20will%20only%20do%20so%20whenever%20it%20becomes%20scarce.md). But It is not necessary to go into details as to how this will be accomplished, as it will not convince those who regard the people as a mob of savages ready to devour each other as soon as the government ceases to direct affairs. But only those who have never seen people resolve and act on their own initiative could doubt for a moment that if the masses were masters of the situation, they would distribute rations to each and all in the strictest accordance with justice and equity.

Let people organize freely, and the services will be conducted with admirable regularity. Only those who have never seen the people hard at work can doubt it. Speak of the organizing genius of the people to those who have seen it in Paris in the days of the barricades, or in London during the great dockers‚Äô strike, when half a million of starving folk had to be fed, and they will tell you how superior it is to heirarchical organization. Here is a circumstance in which [we can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives](We%20can%20use%20our%20stress%20as%20a%20navigational%20tool%20to%20help%20guide%20our%20lives.md). A system which springs up spontaneously, by [non-forcing](Non-forcing.md), and under the stress of immediate need, will be infinitely more preferable to anything invented by theorists or committees and imposed by governments. Besides, [organization would be more effecient and less constraining without government intervention](Organization%20would%20be%20more%20effecient%20and%20less%20constraining%20without%20government%20intervention.md).
