## The finite models of the universe that we cling to lead us to discard the infinity of existential reality

Existential reality Is abysmal. In one dimension, this merely asserts that it is endless; the deeper you look into it, the more you see. It has this sense of infinity about it. The "real" universe‚Äîthe [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) that has become experienced as the real universe‚Äîis, on the other hand, quite finite. It is compact and tidy, since it has been manufactured by discarding all inconvenient parts of our existential experience: [our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important](Our%20brains%20unconsciously%20focus%20on%20only%20a%20select%20few%20of%20the%20sensory%20signals%20it%20receives%20that%20it%20considers%20important.md). This is why those self-hypnotized by a "real" universe of this sort can be so oblivious to the existential continuum around them.
