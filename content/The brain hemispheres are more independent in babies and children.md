## The brain hemispheres are more independent in babies and children

Independent functioning of the [brain hemisphere]()s is one of the achievements of maturity: children are, relatively speaking, split-[brain](Brain.md) subjects, with less interhemispheric independence. Babies and young children are less reliant on the [corpus callosum](Corpus%20callosum.md): callosal [myelin](Myelin.md)ation does not even begin until the end of the first year of life, and progresses only slowly thereafter. Pre-adolescent children find it relatively difficult to use their hemispheres separately, which is still further evidence of the inhibitory role played by the [corpus callosum](Corpus%20callosum.md) in adults. Interhemispheric connectivity grows during childhood and adolescence, with the result that the hemispheres become more independent.
