## The poor have been shown to have higher levels of cortisol  # 

There are many [[stressor]]s involved in poverty:

- [[Poverty can bring many physical stressors]]
- [[Poverty can bring many psychological stressors]]
- [[The poor are less able to plan for the future and can only respond to present stressors]]
- [[The poor have less outlets to help deal with stress]]
- [[The poor lack social support]]

All these hardships suggest that low socioeconomic status (SES‚Äîtypically measured by a combination of income, occupation, housing conditions, and education) should be associated with chronic activation of the [[stress-response]]. Only a few studies have looked at this, but they support this view. 

One concerned school kids in Montreal, a city with fairly stable communities and low crime. In six-and eight-year-old children, there was already a tendency for lower-SES kids to have elevated [[cortisol]] levels. By age ten, there was a step-wise gradient, with low-SES kids averaging almost double the circulating [[cortisol]] as the highest SES kids. Another example concerns people in Lithuania. In 1978, men in Lithuania, then part of the USSR, had the same mortality rates for [[heart disease]] as did men in nearby Sweden. By 1994, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Lithuanians had four times the Swedish rate. In 1994 Sweden, SES was not related to [[cortisol]] levels, whereas in 1994 Lithuania, it was strongly related.
