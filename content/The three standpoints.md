## The three standpoints  #⏳ 

[[We ordinarily perceive reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]], so help us transform our understanding and deepen our perspective on the world, [[the Buddha]] offered three standpoints from which we can appraise the values by which we order our lives. These three standpoints can also represent three moments or steps in an unfolding process of [[insight]]. These three moments are: 

- gratification
- danger
- escape

Gratification involves the [[pleasure]] we experience when we succeed in accomplishing our goals. If we are being [[Mindfulness|mindful]], we can see that such [[pleasure]] can be far from satisfactory, to the contrary, it holds various drawbacks, or dangers. The most prominent of dangers being the fact that such pleasures are [[Impermanence|fleeting]], short-term, and more unsatisfying in the long run. “Escape” here is not escapism, a word that implies an anxious attempt to avoid facing one’s problems by pretending they don’t exist and losing oneself in distractions. True escape is quite the opposite: Once we see that our goals and values are flawed and beset with hidden dangers, we realize that the way to escape lies in moderation or in letting go of them altogether. This can help us switch our priorities from short-term to [[delayed gratification]].
