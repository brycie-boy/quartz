## Social capital

While “financial capital” says something about the depth and range of financial resources you can draw on in troubled times, social capital refers to the same in the social realm. By definition, social capital occurs at the level of a community, rather than at the level of individuals or individual social networks. What makes for social capital? A community in which there is a lot of volunteerism and numerous organizations that people can join which make them feel like they’re part of something bigger than themselves. Where people don’t lock their doors. Where people in the community would stop kids from vandalizing a car even if they don’t know whose car it is. Where kids don’t try to vandalize cars.
