## The frontal cortex is equally vulnerable to shrinkage from cortisol as the hippocampus  #üß†

Not only do [elevated levels of cortisol shrink the hippocampus](Elevated%20levels%20of%20cortisol%20can%20shrink%20the%20hippocampus.md), but it has also been associated in some studies with decreased volume in the [frontal cortex](). This was initially puzzling for those of us who view the world through [cortisol](Cortisol.md)-tinted glasses, but has recently been resolved. In the rat, the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md) is overwhelmingly the target in the [brain](Brain.md) for [glucocorticoid]() action, as measured by the density of [receptor](Receptor.md)s for the [hormone]()s; however, in the primate [brain](Brain.md), the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md) and [frontal cortex]() seem to be equally and markedly sensitive to [glucocorticoid]()s.
