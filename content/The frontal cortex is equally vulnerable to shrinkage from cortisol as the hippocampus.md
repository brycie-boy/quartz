## The frontal cortex is equally vulnerable to shrinkage from cortisol as the hippocampus  #üß† 

Not only do [[elevated levels of cortisol can shrink the hippocampus|elevated levels of cortisol shrink the hippocampus]], it has also been associated in some studies with decreased volume in the [[frontal cortex]]. This was initially confusing to researchers, but has since been resolved. In the rat, the [[hippocampus]] is overwhelmingly the target in the [[brain]] for [[glucocorticoid]] action, as measured by the density of [[receptor]]s for the [[hormone]]s; however, in the primate [[brain]], the [[hippocampus]] and [[frontal cortex]] seem to be equally and markedly sensitive to [[glucocorticoid]]s.
