## HPA axis #🧠 

The HPA axis is a complex set of direct influences and feedback interactions among three components: the [[hypothalamus]], the [[pituitary gland]], and the [[adrenal gland]]s. The HPA axis is the neuroendocrine interface between the body and emotion, and is essential to our subjective appreciation of the body's physiological condition. The HPA axis controls reactions to stress and regulates many other body processes. It is intimately connected with the unconscious and automatic systems for regulating the body and its level of arousal, for example through the autonomic control of [[heart]] rate or neuroendocrine function. In moments of stress, the HPA axis acts like the childhood game of telephone. FIrst, the [[amygdala]] tells the [[hypothalamus]], which tells the [[pituitary]], which tells the [[adrenal glands]] to release [[cortisol]].
