## ADHD and sleep dificiency symptoms are nearly identical

If you make a composite of the symptoms of [ADHD](ADHD.md) and then strip away the label of [ADHD](ADHD.md), these symptoms are nearly identical to those caused by a sleep deficiency. The common [ADHD](ADHD.md) medications [Adderall]() is an [amphetamine]() with certain salts mixed in, and [Ritalin]() is a methylphenidate. [Amphetamine]() and methylphenidate are two of the most powerful drugs we know of to prevent sleep and keep the [brain](Brain.md) of people wide awake. This is even more concerning considering that that roughly 35 percent of the adult population doesn‚Äôt get enough sleep (on average less than seven hours per night). Also, [depression can interfear with circadian cortisol regulation](Depression%20can%20interfear%20with%20circadian%20cortisol%20regulation.md). Again we see how [modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it](Modern%20medicine%20tends%20to%20target%20the%20pathology%20of%20an%20illness%20rather%20than%20preventing%20it.md).
