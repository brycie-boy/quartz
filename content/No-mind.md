## No-mind # 

In Zen Buddhism, no-mind is a mental state that involves an absence of discursive thought and judgment, so the person is totally free to act without hesitation and without disturbance from such thoughts. At this point, a person relies not on what they _think_ should be the next move, but what is their trained natural reaction (or instinct) or what is _felt_ intuitively.
