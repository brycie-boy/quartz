## No-mind

In Zen Buddhism, no-mind is a mental state that involves an absence of discursive thought and judgment, so the person is totally free to act without hesitation and without disturbance from such thoughts. At this point, a person relies not on what they *think* should be the next move, but what is their trained natural reaction (or instinct) or what is *felt* intuitively.
