## Volitional formation #‚è≥ 

Volitional formations are one of [[the five aggregates]]. They‚Äôre defined as a term involving the maltifarious mental factors including volition, choice, and attention both wholesome and unwholesome. In the first passive sense, volitional formations refer to all mental dispositions. These are called 'volitional formations' both because they are formed as a result of volition and because they are causes for the arising of future volitional actions. The second active sense of the term refers to [[kamma]], which leads to future [[rebirth]].

Their functions are in directing the mind in the sphere of wholesome, unwholesome or neutral activities. There are three types of volitional formations: bodily, verbal, and mental. The cause and condition for the manifestation of volitional formations is [[sense impression]].
