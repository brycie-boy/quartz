## The brain can contemplate its own contents and develop unlimited ideas about itself   # 

Any idea or mental state is a brain circuit which the brain itself can contemplate, thereby having an idea about the idea, or a mental state about a mental state, etc. There is no theoretical or real limit to the higher-ordering process; it is the “Infinity Within” of which mystics speak. In the province of the mind, what is believed true is true or becomes true within limits to be learned by experience and experiment. These limits are further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind there are no limits.

The mind and its contents are functionally identical. A freind only exists, for me, in my mind. Not being a solipsist, I recognize the converse: I only exist, for them, in their mind. If I am listening to a good song, the only correct answer, if you ask me suddenly, “Who are you?” would be to hum the song. For, with music of that quality, one is hypnotized into rapt attention, and their is no there is no division between “me” and “my experience.” In heavy meditation, when I think of me, I am me; when I think of me and you, I am me and you; when I think of you alone, I am not there anymore; when I think of God, I am God. What I see with my eyes closed and with my eyes open is the same stuff: brain circuitry.

Mathematician J.W. Dunne puts the matter in a parable. A painter, who had escaped from the asylum to which he was (justly or unjustly) confined, decided to paint the field in which he found himself. Finished, he looked at the result and realized that something was missing: namely, himself and his canvas, which were part of the field. So he started over and painted himself and his canvas in the field. But, examining the results with philosophical analysis, he realized that something was still missing: namely, himself and his canvas on which he was painting himself and his canvas in the field. So he started a third time . . . and a fourth . . . ad infinitum. We think of the paintings of M.C. Escher at this point: Or we recall the old folk-tale of the farmer who set out to market with ten donkeys, on one of which he rode. After a while, he began to wonder if any of the donkeys had strayed and he began counting and there seemed to be only nine. Disturbed, he dismounted and walked around the herd, counting carefully—and there were ten after all. So he remounted and went on riding, until worry beset him again. So he counted another time . . .and there were nine. So, once again, he dismounted and walked about counting carefully to find ten. The process is repeated until he finally solves the problem, carrying one donkey on his back and driving the other nine before him. The “disappearing donkey” trick is the epitome of ideas about ideas about ideas, paintings of paintings of paintings, etc.
