## Peripheral nervous system

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two components that make of the [nervous system](). The PNS consists of [neuron](Neuron.md)s that lie outside of the [brain](Brain.md) and [spinal cord](). The main function of the PNS is to connect the [CNS]() to the limbs and organs, including the [sense organs](Six%20sense%20bases.md), essentially serving as a relay between the [brain ]()and [spinal cord]() and the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system can be devided into the [somatic nervous system]() and the [autonomic nervous system](Autonomic%20nervous%20system.md).
