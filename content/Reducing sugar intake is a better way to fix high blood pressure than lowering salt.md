## Reducing sugar intake is a better way to fix high blood pressure than lowering salt

What dietary maneuver can fix [blood pressure]() even faster? How about sugar restriction? Sugar raises your [blood pressure]() more than salt. Sugar also causes [liver]() [fat]() accumulation, [insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md), and increased diastolic [blood pressure](). Sugar restriction quite rapidly reduces both systolic and diastolic [blood pressure](), as long as the patient in question doesn’t have preexisting [kidney]() disease. So what’s the most effective method of treatment: lowering salt, getting rid of sugar, or taking [blood pressure]() medication? If you take [processed food]() out, you’ve lowered salt and sugar, and you wouldn’t need the medicine.

Only 20 percent of a [glucose]() load enters the [liver](), and the majority is turned into [glycogen]() ([liver]() starch) for storage. A small amount of [glucose]() will undergo [glycolysis](Glycolysis.md) (the first step of [glucose]() metabolism, which doesn’t need [oxygen]()) to the breakdown product [pyruvate](). [Pyruvate]() can then enter the [mitochondria]() to be burned via the [Krebs cycle]() all the way to [carbon dioxide]() and [water](), capturing energy in the form of the chemical adenosine triphosphate ([ATP]())—the energy is in the [phosphate]()s. 

100 percent of a [fructose]() load enters the [liver](). [Fructose]() leads to loss of [phosphate]()s from [ATP](), generating of [uric acid](), which reduces [nitric oxide](), your [blood vessel]()s’ relaxing agent, which leads to [hypertension](). Most of the [fructose]() is turned into [pyruvate](), the [mitochondria]() become overwhelmed, and the excess generates [liver]() [fat](), which causes [insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md). High [insulin](Insulin.md) interferes with satiety, driving further consumption.
