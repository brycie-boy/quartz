## Societal conditioning has lead us to overlook instances of free organization between workers

By [conditioning](Conditioning.md) and indocternation, we have been lead to believe that man would tear his fellow man to pieces like a wild beast the very day the police took their eye off them; that absolute chaos would comense if authority were overthrown during a revolution. And with our eyes shut we pass by thousands and thousands of human groupings which form themselves freely, without any intervention of the law, and attain results infinitely superior to those achieved under the intervention of authority. In this way we do not even perceive the prodigious work accomplished every day by spontaneous groups of people. We may see that people, as soon as their interests do not absolutely clash, act in concert, harmoniously, and perform collective work of a very complex nature.
