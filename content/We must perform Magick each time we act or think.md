## We must perform Magick each time we act or think # 

[[Each thing is interlinked to the rest of the Universe in various ways we do not yet know]]. Every person must therefor do [[Magick]] each time that they act or¬†even think, since a thought is an internal act whose influence ultimately affects action, even though it may not do so at the time. Even the smallest gesture causes a change in ones own body and in the air around them; it disturbs the balance of the entire Universe and its effects continue eternally throughout all space. Every thought, however swiftly suppressed, has its effect on the mind. [[Neural activity changes in accordance with mental activity]], and each time we think that thought, it's neural circuits are ever so slightly strengthened. It also stands as one of the causes of every subsequent thought, and tends to influence every subsequent action.
