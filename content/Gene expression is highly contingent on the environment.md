## Gene expression is highly contingent on the environment # 

To state that [[childhood development plays a strong role in the development of mental illness and addiction]] is not to rule out [[gene]]tic factors. However, the emphasis placed on [[gene]]tic influences in medicine and psychiatry is an impediment to our understanding. The view that [[gene]]s play a decisive role in the way a person‚Äôs [[brain]] and body develops has been replaced by a radically different notion: the expression of [[gene]]tic potentials is, for the most part, contingent on the environment. [[Gene]]s do dictate the basic organization, developmental schedule, and anatomical structure of the human [[central nervous system]], but it‚Äôs left to the environment to sculpt and fine-tune the chemistry, connections, circuits, networks, and systems that determine how well we function.
