## Gene expression is highly contingent on the environment

To state that [childhood development plays a strong role in the development of mental illness and addiction](Childhood%20development%20plays%20a%20strong%20role%20in%20the%20development%20of%20mental%20illness%20and%20addiction.md) is not to rule out [gene]()tic factors. However, the emphasis placed on [gene]()tic influences in medicine and psychiatry is an impediment to our understanding. The view that [gene]()s play a decisive role in the way a person‚Äôs [brain](Brain.md) and body develops has been replaced by a radically different notion: the expression of [gene]()tic potentials is, for the most part, contingent on the environment. [Gene]()s do dictate the basic organization, developmental schedule, and anatomical structure of the human [central nervous system](), but it‚Äôs left to the environment to sculpt and fine-tune the chemistry, connections, circuits, networks, and systems that determine how well we function.
