## The brains of babies mimic the emotional conditions of their caregivers

The electrical activity of the infant’s [brain](Brain.md) is exquisitely sensitive to that of the nurturing adult. A study at the University of Washington in Seattle compared the brain-wave patterns of two groups of six-month-old infants: one group whose mothers were suffering postpartum [depression](Depression.md) and one group whose mothers were in normal good spirits. [EEG]()s showed consistent, marked differences between the two groups: the babies of the depressed mothers had [EEG]() patterns characteristic of [depression](Depression.md) even during interactions with their mothers that were meant to elicit a joyful response. Significantly, these effects were noted only in the [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md)s.

How does this pertain to [brain](Brain.md) development? Repeatedly firing [neuron](Neuron.md) patterns become wired into the [brain](Brain.md) and will form part of a person’s habitual responses to the world. In the words of the great Canadian neuroscientist [Donald Hebb](), “cells that fire together, wire together.” The infants of stressed or depressed parents are likely to encode negative emotional patterns in their [brain](Brain.md)s. The long-term effect of parental mood on the biology of the child’s [brain](Brain.md) is illustrated by several studies showing that concentrations of [cortisol](Cortisol.md) are elevated in the children of clinically depressed mothers. At age three, the highest [cortisol](Cortisol.md) levels were found in those children whose mothers had been depressed during the child’s first year of life, rather than later

Thus we see that the [brain](Brain.md) is “experience-dependent.” Good experiences lead to healthy [brain](Brain.md) development, while the absence of good experiences or the presence of bad ones distorts development in essential [brain](Brain.md) structures. An abnormal or impoverished rearing environment can decrease a thousand fold the number of [synapse](Synapse.md)s per [axon](Axon.md), retard growth and eliminate billions if not trillions of [synapse](Synapse.md)s per [brain](Brain.md), and result in the preservation of abnormal interconnections which are normally discarded over the course of development
