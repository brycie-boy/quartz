## The brains of babies mimic the emotional conditions of their caregivers # 

The [[right hemisphere]] of the caregivers [[brain]], the side where our unconscious emotions reside ([[the left hemisphere generally remains emotionally neutral]]), programs the infant‚Äôs [[right hemisphere]]. In the early months, the most important communications between the caregiver and the infant are unconscious ones. [[Babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left]]. Incapable of deciphering the meaning of words, the infant receives messages that are purely emotional. They are conveyed by the caregivers gaze, their tone of voice and their body language, all of which reflect their unconscious internal emotional environment.

The electrical activity of the infant‚Äôs [[brain]] is exquisitely sensitive to that of the nurturing adult. A study at the University of Washington in Seattle compared the [[brain-wave]] patterns of two groups of six-month-old infants: one group whose mothers were suffering postpartum [[depression]] and one group whose mothers were in normal good spirits. [[EEG]]s showed consistent, marked differences between the two groups: the babies of the depressed mothers had [[EEG]] patterns characteristic of [[depression]] even during interactions with their mothers that were meant to elicit a joyful response. Significantly, these effects were noted only in the [[frontal lobe]]s.

[[The brain selects for the brain circuits that are most utilized throughout development]]. How does this pertain to [[brain]] development? Repeatedly firing [[neuron]] patterns become wired into the [[brain]] and will form part of a person‚Äôs [[habit]]ual responses to the world. In the words of the great Canadian neuroscientist [[Donald Hebb]], ‚Äúcells that fire together, wire together.‚Äù The infants of stressed or depressed parents are likely to encode negative emotional patterns in their [[brain]]s. The long-term effect of parental mood on the biology of the child‚Äôs [[brain]] is illustrated by several studies showing that concentrations of [[cortisol]] are elevated in the children of clinically depressed mothers. At age three, the highest [[cortisol]] levels were found in those children whose mothers had been depressed during the child‚Äôs first year of life, rather than later

Thus we see that the [[brain]] is ‚Äúexperience-dependent.‚Äù Good experiences lead to healthy [[brain]] development, while the absence of good experiences or the presence of bad ones distorts development in essential [[brain]] structures. An abnormal or impoverished rearing environment can decrease a thousand fold the number of [[synapse]]s per [[axon]], retard growth and eliminate billions if not trillions of [[synapse]]s per [[brain]], and result in the preservation of abnormal interconnections which are normally discarded over the course of development
