## Amygdala hijack # 

In [[amygdala]] hijack, the [[amygdala]] drives [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] circuitry whenever anger or anxiety is triggered. As such disturbing emotions reach their peak, an amygdala hijack paralyzes [[executive functions]].

The [[limbic system]] processes information milliseconds earlier than the [[neocortex]]. If the record of experiences in our memory tells the [[amygdala]] that it is a [[Sympathetic nervous system|fight or flight]] situation, then the [[amygdala]] triggers the [[HPA axis]] sequence and hijacks our attention before any possible direction from the [[neocortex]] can be received. If, however, the [[amygdala]] does not find any match to the stimulus received with its recorded threatening situations, then it acts according to the directions received from the [[neocortex]].
