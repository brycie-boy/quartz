The Cosmic Dark Ages of the universe began around 370,000 years after the [[Big Bang]] and lasted hundreds of millions of years. During this period, the temperature of the universe cooled from about 4000 K to about 60 K, and only two sources of [[photon]]s existed: the [[photon]]s released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s formed), which we can still detect today as the [[cosmic microwave background]], and [[photon]]s occasionally released by neutral [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s, known as the 21 cm spin line of neutral [[hydrogen]].
