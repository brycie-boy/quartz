The Cosmic Dark Ages of the universe began around 370,000 years after the [Big Bang]() and lasted hundreds of millions of years. During this period, the temperature of the universe cooled from about 4000 K to about 60 K, and only two sources of [photon]()s existed: the [photon]()s released during recombination/decoupling (as neutral [hydrogen]() [atom]()s formed), which we can still detect today as the [cosmic microwave background](), and [photon]()s occasionally released by neutral [hydrogen]() [atom]()s, known as the 21 cm spin line of neutral [hydrogen]().
