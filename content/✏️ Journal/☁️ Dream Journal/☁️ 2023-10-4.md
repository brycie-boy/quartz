I was in a pool and there was this cute girl who kept looking at me. One of her friends told me she thought I was cute. I didn’t get a good chance to talk to her, and I saw them get out of the pool and go into some room. They said they’d be back but I was impatient I guess. I remember petting a big dog while waiting. I followed them planning it talk to her. It let to this giant upward stair case. I went up and saw them for a brief moment. It led to some bedrooms which they said were theirs. Then I walked out of a door and it opened up this giant fucking minecraft cave city. They like yeah you’ve stumbled across cave world or some shit like that. Then we turned into Minecraft characters. I never hit a good fucking look at that girl
