- first Dream I was just cooking chicken and waiting to leave with dad to some dinner we were invited to. Normal as fuck
- Second Dream. I was being told a story from some guy about this ps2 he got as a kid which upon turning on would just show strange and often scary images, usually red. However, he was drawn to it and couldn’t stop turning it back on for some reason. He told me how he started to act completely ape shit when it was on and had footage. He said he was “staring to lose it.” He remembered thinking he was just “being silly” but in the footage he just looked off his rocker. He would have red skin like blood was pumping after a hot bath or workout something and very wide eyes. Then he just rapidly make strange movements and sounds, occasionally like those demon possession footage videos where it was just a completely different inhuman voice. It was like he was trying to act as weird as possible. They eventually got rid of the console after he was caught doing it. Really disturbed me and I woke up
