I was at school. Mom said it was my last day unannounced so I had no time to say bye to any of my friends. I remember getting kicked out of class for some reason too. Then I was in the back waiting to be picked up. My mom showed up and said she would park so I could talk to my friends one last time. Then I told my friend, which was Jackson, that I was gonna leave and walk to my moms car. He said the place she parked was strange and had some kind of castle up there with a train. As I was walking up there I heard papaw and Tyler. I went up there and there was a cliff side castle looking over a beautiful gorge with a water fall. For some reason this gorge felt completely familiar to me. Like it was always next to my school. For some reason I was hiding from my family. As I went up, a green train ran through the castle and I knew papaw and Tyler were in it somehow. Eventually my mom came in. She was on the phone and mad, and I hid from her under the stair well. Then I remember telling to mom that I was there because she seemed to know someone was in there already and was looking. Then I woke up
