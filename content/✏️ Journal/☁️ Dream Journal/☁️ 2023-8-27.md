- hardly remember my dreams today. Remember 3 nightmares. One was my new neighbors were insane and would secretly collude to kill me. Another was some weird whispering voice that high jacked my mind. I eventually got tired of it and asked it to kill me and it slowly said “I oblige” like it was smiling. 3 was I walked into my dads bedroom and he had a double who was starting off into space while the other was in bed. I remember shaking it trying to wake him up. Then it stated saying random numbers like those military number radio stations into my ear and I got scared and woke up.
