## Poor performers are less able to distiguish between good and bad performances

One reason for the [Dunning-Kruger effect](Dunning-Kruger%20effect.md) may be that poor performers have not yet acquired the ability to distinguish between good and bad performances. They tend to overrate themselves because they do not see the qualitative difference between their performances and the performances of others.
