## When we recognize the gamble in every perception, we realize the active and creative nature of our consciousness # 

Where the Materialist metaphor for [[consciousness]] appears passive, once we recognize that [[each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty]], [[consciousness]] appears very active indeed. Nobody is born a great pianist, a quantum physicist, a theologian, or a murder: people have made themselves into those things by actively selecting which perception-gambles they will make [[habit]]ual and what types of other experiences they will edit our as "irrelevant." The typical [[Conformity|conformist]]‚Äîthe typical "bank-clerk", say‚Äîwill reveal some astonishing creative acts in their own private model if you talk to such a person long enough.

If [[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]], then consciousness is not a passive receptor, but an active creator, busy every nanosecond projecting the artwork that is an individualized [[reality tunnel]] and is usually hypnotically dreamed of as the "real" universe. This trance, in most cases, appears as deep as anybody professionally hypnotized to repress pain during surgery. And [[the more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world]], but we are not victims of the "real" universe, we have created the "real" universe that we have [[Reification|reified]] and happen to be victimized by. At this point one begins to perceive that their are at least two kinds of [[consciousness]]: [[hypnotized consciousness]] and [[existentialist consciousness]].
