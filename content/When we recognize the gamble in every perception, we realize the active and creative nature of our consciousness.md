## When we recognize the gamble in every perception, we realize the active and creative nature of our consciousness

Where the Materialist metaphor for [consciousness](Consciousness.md) appears passive, once we recognize that [each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty](Each%20perception%20that%20we%20make%20is%20best%20considered%20to%20be%20a%20gamble%20rather%20than%20a%20certainty.md), [consciousness](Consciousness.md) appears very active indeed. Nobody is born a great pianist, a quantum physicist, a theologian, or a murder: people have made themselves into those things by actively selecting which perception-gambles they will make [habit](Habit.md)ual and what types of other experiences they will edit our as "irrelevant." The typical [conformist](Conformity.md)‚Äîthe typical "bank-clerk", say‚Äîwill reveal some astonishing creative acts in their own private model if you talk to such a person long enough.

If [the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input](The%20brain's%20perceptual%20systems%20actively%20and%20pre-consciously%20interpret%20and%20edit%20their%20input.md), then consciousness is not a passive receptor, but an active creator, busy every nanosecond projecting the artwork that is an individualized [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) and is usually hypnotically dreamed of as the "real" universe. This trance, in most cases, appears as deep as anybody professionally hypnotized to repress pain during surgery. And [the more certain of our views we become, the more we perceive ourselves to be victims of an impersonal world](The%20more%20certain%20of%20our%20views%20we%20become,%20the%20more%20we%20perceive%20ourselves%20to%20be%20victims%20of%20an%20impersonal%20world.md), but we are not victims of the "real" universe, we have created the "real" universe that we have [reified](Reification.md) and happen to be victimized by. At this point one begins to perceive that their are at least two kinds of [consciousness](Consciousness.md): [hypnotized consciousness](Hypnotized%20consciousness.md) and [existentialist consciousness](Existentialist%20consciousness.md).
