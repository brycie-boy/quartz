## The adaptive function  # 

The adaptive function is the first of [[Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school]]. It states that schools are to establish fixed [[habit]]s of reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes critical judgment completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea that useful or interesting material should be taught, because you can’t test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn, and do, foolish and boring things. [[The use positive and negative reinforcement in schools condition students for emotional dependence on authority]]. Also, [[schools encourage intellectual dependency towards authority by discouraging inquiry]].
