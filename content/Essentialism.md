## Essentialism  #🧠

Essentialism is the view that objects have a inherent set of attributes that are necessary to their identity. [Plato]() held that all things have an "essence"—an "idea" or "form." [Aristotle]() similarly proposed that all objects have a substance that "make the thing what it is, and without which it would not be *that* kind of thing." Essentialism may be a product of [reification](Reification.md).
