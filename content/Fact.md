## Fact

A fact is a datum about one or more aspects of a circumstance, which, if accepted as true and proven true, allows a [logical conclusion](Logical%20consequence.md) to be reached on a true-false evaluation. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments.
