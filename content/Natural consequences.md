## Natural consequences

Natural consequences are simply what happens as a result of a person's actions, without any intervention by an outside party. The key to using natural consequences is to step aside and allow people to experience the effect of their what they've done or not done. By not intervening when a someone makes a misstep, the we let people learn by doing, truly experiencing the fruits of their labors. If the natural consequence is unwanted or unpleasant, the person has the opportunity to learn from the experience and do things differently the next time to avoid the unpleasant experience. From an ethical standpoint, I believe it to align with [consequentialist](Consequentialism.md) ethics.
