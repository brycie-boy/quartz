## Stream-entry

Stream-entry is the first of [the four stages of awakening](The%20four%20stages%20of%20awakening.md).  This stage involves the eradication of the first three fetters, which are [Identity view](Identity%20view.md), doubt, and the wrong grasp of rules and observances; the belief that mere external observances, paticularly religious rituals and ascetic practices, can lead to liberation. The stream enterer is assured of attaining [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) in atmost seven more existences, which may take place in [The sense-sphere realm]()s.
