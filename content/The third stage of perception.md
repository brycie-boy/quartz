## The third stage of perception #üß† 

The third stage of perception (see [[the second stage of perception]]) involves the organismic reaction which can be quite complex. For instance, if the energy-packet happened to be "Your mother has been raped and murdered by terrorists" the stomach, tear ducts, and heart at least will be involved in processing the signal, as well as the [[amygdala]]. It is obvious that with subtraction, perception also involves an addition of pre-existing emotions, which is what [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] meant by "[[projection]]." The transition from stage three to [[The fourth stage of perception|stage four]] involves the transmission of all of this to the [[brain]]. Obviously, what the [[brain]] recieves is already highly colored by the subtractions and additions previously mentioned; but the [[brain]] itself, except perhaps in a newborn infant, already has a set of preconfigured programs, or a "filing system" for organizing and classifying incoming signals.
