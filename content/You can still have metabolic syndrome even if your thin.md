## You can still have metabolic syndrome even if your thin  # 

[[Weight gain occurs after metabolic syndrome]], but when you look at the normal weight population, approximately 40 percent of those people also have [[metabolic syndrome]]—meaning they have metabolic dysfunction, [[insulin resistance]], and high [[insulin]] levels. But for whatever reason, they’re just not obese. In some of them, their fat [[cell]]s are [[Insulin resistance|insulin resistant]], too, so energy doesn’t accumulate in the [[subcutaneous fat]] tissue. Instead they put it in other [[organ]]s that shouldn’t have fat, such as muscle and the [[liver]]. This has spawned a new medical term called TOFI, or thin on the outside, fat on the inside.
