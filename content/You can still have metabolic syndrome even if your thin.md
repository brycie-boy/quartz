## You can still have metabolic syndrome even if your thin

[Weight gain occurs after metabolic syndrome](Weight%20gain%20occurs%20after%20metabolic%20syndrome.md), but when you look at the normal weight population, approximately 40 percent of those people also have [metabolic syndrome](Metabolic%20syndrome.md)—meaning they have metabolic dysfunction, [insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md), and high [insulin](Insulin.md) levels. But for whatever reason, they’re just not obese. In some of them, their fat [cell]()s are [insulin resistant](Insulin%20resistance.md), too, so energy doesn’t accumulate in the [subcutaneous fat]() tissue. Instead they put it in other [organ]()s that shouldn’t have fat, such as muscle and the [liver](). This has spawned a new medical term called TOFI, or thin on the outside, fat on the inside.
