## The right hemisphere is capable of identifying emotional expression

It is the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) that identifies emotional expression: it is faster and more accurate than the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) in discriminating facial expression of emotion. Specifically the right [superior temporal sulcus]() appears to be involved in recognition of facial emotion. The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is the locus of interpretation, not only of facial expression, but of prosody (vocal intonation) and gesture. The superiority for emotional perception is in addition to, and distinct from, the right [parietal lobe]()'s known superiority for visuospatial interpretation. Those with [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) damage have difficulty understanding emotional intonation or implication.
