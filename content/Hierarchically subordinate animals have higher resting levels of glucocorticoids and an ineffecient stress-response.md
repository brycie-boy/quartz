## Hierarchically subordinate animals have higher resting levels of glucocorticoids and an ineffecient stress-response

[Hierarchically subordinate animals tend to be over-stressed due to uncontrollable and unpredictable mistreatment from superiors](Hierarchically%20subordinate%20animals%20tend%20to%20be%20over-stressed%20due%20to%20uncontrollable%20and%20unpredictable%20mistreatment%20from%20superiors.md), so It‚Äôs not surprising, then, that among subordinate male baboons, resting levels of [glucocorticoid]()s are significantly higher than among dominant individuals‚Äîfor a subordinate, everyday basal circumstances are stressful. And that‚Äôs just the start of subordinates‚Äô problems with [glucocorticoid]()s. When a real [stressor](Stressor.md) comes along, their [glucocorticoid]() response is smaller and slower than in dominant individuals. And when it‚Äôs all passed, their recovery appears to be delayed. All these are features that count as an inefficient [stress-response](Stress-response.md).

More problems for subordinate individuals: elevated resting blood pressure; sluggish cardiovascular response to real stressors; a sluggish recovery; suppressed levels of the good HDL cholesterol; among male subordinates, testosterone levels that are more easily suppressed by stress than in dominant males; fewer circulating white blood cells; and lower circulating levels of something called insulin-like growth factor-I, which helps heal wounds.
