## Hierarchically subordinate animals have higher resting levels of glucocorticoids and an ineffecient stress-response # 

[[Hierarchically subordinate animals tend to be over-stressed due to uncontrollable and unpredictable mistreatment from superiors]], so It‚Äôs not surprising, then, that among subordinate male baboons, resting levels of [[glucocorticoid]]s are significantly higher than among dominant individuals‚Äîfor a subordinate, everyday basal circumstances are stressful. And that‚Äôs just the start of subordinates‚Äô problems with [[glucocorticoid]]s. When a real [[stressor]] comes along, their [[glucocorticoid]] response is smaller and slower than in dominant individuals. And when it‚Äôs all passed, their recovery appears to be delayed. All these are features that count as an inefficient [[stress-response]].

More problems for subordinate individuals: elevated resting blood pressure; sluggish cardiovascular response to real stressors; a sluggish recovery; suppressed levels of the good HDL cholesterol; among male subordinates, testosterone levels that are more easily suppressed by stress than in dominant males; fewer circulating white blood cells; and lower circulating levels of something called insulin-like growth factor-I, which helps heal wounds.
