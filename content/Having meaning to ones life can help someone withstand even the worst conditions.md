## Having meaning to ones life can help someone withstand even the worst conditions

[Viktor Frankl]() had claimed that here is nothing in the world that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one‚Äôs life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: ‚ÄúHe who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.‚Äù He can see in these words a motto which holds true for any [psychotherapy](). In the Nazi concentration camps, which Frankl previously found himself in, he believes one could have witnessed that those who knew that there was a task waiting for them to fulfill were most apt to survive.
