## The propaedeutic function

The propaedeutic function is one of [Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school](Alexander%20Inglis%20six%20basic%20functions%20of%20school.md). It states that the societal system implied by these rules will require an elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small fraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this continuing project, how to watch over and control a population deliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might proceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient labor.
