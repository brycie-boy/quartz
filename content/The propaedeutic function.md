## The propaedeutic function  # 

The propaedeutic function is one of [[Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school]]. It states that the societal system implied by these rules will require an elite group of caretakers. To that end, a small fraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this continuing project, how to watch over and control a population deliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might proceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient labor.
