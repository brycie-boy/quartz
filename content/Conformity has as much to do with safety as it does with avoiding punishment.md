## Conformity has as much to do with safety as it does with avoiding punishment

From the perspective of [social identity theory](Social%20identity%20theory.md), [conformity](Conformity.md), while certainly being about avoiding punishment, is at least as much about the positives of fitting in. When we imitate someone‚Äôs actions, our [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) activates. When we choose incorrectly in a task, the [dopamine](Dopamine.md)rgic decline is less if we made the decision as part of a group than if we did so as an individual. Belonging is safety.
