## Conformity has as much to do with safety as it does with avoiding punishment # 

From the perspective of [[social identity theory]], [[conformity]], while as the [[normative influence]] implies is certainly being about avoiding punishment, is at least as much about the benefits of fitting in. When we imitate someone‚Äôs actions, our [[mesolimbic pathway]] activates. When we choose incorrectly in a task, the [[dopamine]]rgic decline is less if we made the decision as part of a group than if we did so as an individual. Belonging is safety.
