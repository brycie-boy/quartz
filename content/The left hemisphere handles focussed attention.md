## The left hemisphere handles focussed attention

Deficits in focussed attention are more severe with [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) injury. Although selective attention may be bilateral, it is more typically associated with activity in the left [caudate nucleus]() or left [anterior cingulate cortex](). Healthy subjects show a [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) preference for choice reactions. And scanning studies suggest focussed attention is associated with activity in the left [orbitofrontal cortex](Orbitofrontal%20cortex.md) and [basal ganglia](Basal%20ganglia.md).
