## The left hemisphere handles focussed attention  # 

Deficits in focussed attention are more severe with [[left hemisphere]] injury. Although selective attention may be bilateral, it is more typically associated with activity in the left [[caudate nucleus]] or left [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. Healthy subjects show a [[left hemisphere]] preference for choice reactions. And scanning studies suggest focussed attention is associated with activity in the left [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and [[basal ganglia]].
