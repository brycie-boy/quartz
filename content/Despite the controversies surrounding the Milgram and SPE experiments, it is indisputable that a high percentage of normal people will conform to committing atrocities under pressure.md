## Despite the controversies surrounding the Milgram and SPE experiments, it is indisputable that a high percentage of normal people will conform to committing atrocities under pressure # 

[[Stanley Milgram had shown that people would continue to shock someone who missed an answer to a question to deadly levels if ordered to by authority]]. And [[Philip Zimbardo showed in Stanford Prison Experiment that those designated position as guard would comply to commands to commit cruelties toward prisoners]]. However, there is some controversy surrounding their findings:

- [[Gina Perry had criticized Milgram's experiments for fudged results and hiding that many participants had realized the subject was an actor]]
- [[Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment has been criticized for him being too involved]]
- [[Subjects within the Stanford Prison Experiment may have been particularly high in aggressiveness, authoritarianism, and social dominance and lower for empathy and altruism]]
- [[A replication study of the Stanford Prison experiment by the BBC, prisoners revolted and established power-sharing commune, for it to be later turned into a draconian regime]]
- [[Zimbardo criticized the BBC replication study of the SPE for its structure, random selection of guards and prisoners, and for filming it]]

Amid these controversies, two deeply vital things are indisputable: When pressured to [[Conformity|conform]] and obey, a far higher percentage of perfectly normal people than most would predict succumb and do awful things. Contemporary work using a variant on the Milgram paradigm shows ‚Äújust following orders‚Äù in action, where the pattern of neurobiological activation differs when the same act is carried out volitionally versus obediently.
