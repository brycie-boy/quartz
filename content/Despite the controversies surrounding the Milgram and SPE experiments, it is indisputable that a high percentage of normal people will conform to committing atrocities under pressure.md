## Despite the controversies surrounding the Milgram and SPE experiments, it is indisputable that a high percentage of normal people will conform to committing atrocities under pressure

[Stanley Milgram had shown that people would continue to shock someone who missed an answer to a question to deadly levels if ordered to by authority](Stanley%20Milgram%20had%20shown%20that%20people%20would%20continue%20to%20shock%20someone%20who%20missed%20an%20answer%20to%20a%20question%20to%20deadly%20levels%20if%20ordered%20to%20by%20authority.md). And [Philip Zimbardo showed in Stanford Prison Experiment that those designated position as guard would comply to commands to commit cruelties toward prisoners](Philip%20Zimbardo%20showed%20in%20Stanford%20Prison%20Experiment%20that%20those%20designated%20position%20as%20guard%20would%20comply%20to%20commands%20to%20commit%20cruelties%20toward%20prisoners.md). However, there is some controversy surrounding their findings:

* [Gina Perry had criticized Milgram's experiments for fudged results and hiding that many participants had realized the subject was an actor](Gina%20Perry%20had%20criticized%20Milgram's%20experiments%20for%20fudged%20results%20and%20hiding%20that%20many%20participants%20had%20realized%20the%20subject%20was%20an%20actor.md)
* [Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment has been criticized for him being too involved](Zimbardo's%20Stanford%20Prison%20Experiment%20has%20been%20criticized%20for%20him%20being%20too%20involved.md)
* [Subjects within the Stanford Prison Experiment may have been particularly high in aggressiveness, authoritarianism, and social dominance and lower for empathy and altruism](Subjects%20within%20the%20Stanford%20Prison%20Experiment%20may%20have%20been%20particularly%20high%20in%20aggressiveness,%20authoritarianism,%20and%20social%20dominance%20and%20lower%20for%20empathy%20and%20altruism.md)
* [A replication study of the Stanford Prison experiment by the BBC, prisoners revolted and established power-sharing commune, for it to be later turned into a draconian regime](A%20replication%20study%20of%20the%20Stanford%20Prison%20experiment%20by%20the%20BBC,%20prisoners%20revolted%20and%20established%20power-sharing%20commune,%20for%20it%20to%20be%20later%20turned%20into%20a%20draconian%20regime.md)
* [Zimbardo criticized the BBC replication study of the SPE for its structure, random selection of guards and prisoners, and for filming it](Zimbardo%20criticized%20the%20BBC%20replication%20study%20of%20the%20SPE%20for%20its%20structure,%20random%20selection%20of%20guards%20and%20prisoners,%20and%20for%20filming%20it.md)

Amid these controversies, two deeply vital things are indisputable: When pressured to [conform](Conformity.md) and obey, a far higher percentage of perfectly normal people than most would predict succumb and do awful things. Contemporary work using a variant on the Milgram paradigm shows ‚Äújust following orders‚Äù in action, where the pattern of neurobiological activation differs when the same act is carried out volitionally versus obediently.
