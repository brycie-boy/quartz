## Diabetes

Diabetes is a group of common [endocrine]() disease characterized by sustained high [blood glucose]() levels. There are two kinds of diabetes: type 1 is due to [insulin](Insulin.md) deficiency (an autoimmune destruction of the [pancreas]()) and is usually associated with children (although some adults can get it); type 2 is due to [insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md), the key driver of [metabolic syndrome](Metabolic%20syndrome.md) and usually associated with adults (although some children can get it).
