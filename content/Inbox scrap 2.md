The studies on this date back to 1949, when Harry Harlow, a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, set up a lab for studying learning in primates. As part of a study, they placed a mechanical puzzle in the cages of rhesus monkeys. Then, before they had had a chance to start implementing their planned rewards programme, the monkeys started playing with the puzzle by themselves. They kept playing and got better at solving the puzzles.

63

The way that animal behaviour was understood at the time didn’t allow for this. This suggested that the main drives that powered behaviour were biological drives (such as hunger) or extrinsic motivations such as rewards or punishments. The monkeys were not being rewarded in any way for solving the puzzles – and yet they did, and continued to do so. Harlow’s great insight was to propose that solving the puzzles was its own reward for the monkeys – they enjoyed it, and so they did it more. He proposed a third drive influencing behaviour: intrinsic motivation.

63

Harlow then added in an extrinsic reward – the monkeys got raisins for completing the puzzles. He predicted that this would lead to them performing better and completing more puzzles. To his surprise, that wasn’t what he found. In fact, the monkeys who were rewarded made more errors, and solved the puzzles less frequently. It seemed like intrinsic motivation was vulnerable to external circumstances.

63

It took until 1969 for Edward Deci, a social psychologist, to investigate these ideas in humans. Using a task which most people find enjoyable for itself – a wooden puzzle cube – he found that when people were paid for completing the puzzle, it had an effect on their later motivation to play with it. Those who were paid stopped playing when they were no longer paid – whereas those who were never paid, kept going.

63

I’d recommend those puzzle cubes if you want to try out something intrinsically motivating. They are easy to find online. They are indeed lots of fun. If I leave them out on our coffee table, anyone who comes into our house starts fiddling and making shapes. My children have been known to fight over who gets to play with it next. I haven’t experimented with rewarding them to do so, although sometimes it is tempting to see if it might reduce the number of arguments.

64

Their research on intrinsic motivation led Deci and Ryan, a clinical and research psychologist, to come up with Self-Determination Theory, which they describe as being ‘concerned with the social conditions that facilitate or hinder human flourishing’. Self-determination theory is not just about intrinsic motivation, it’s about how to facilitate higher-quality motivation and wellbeing.

64

It was Gina Riley who introduced me to self-determination theory. Riley is a professor in special education at Hunter College and she home-educated her son, who is now an adult and graduated from college last year. When we talked, she described to me the moment that changed her life.

64

‘This goes back twenty or so years . . . I was a student writing my Master’s thesis and I saw an article in the New York Times about intrinsic motivation. I had a three-year-old at the time; I was a young mum. I saw this article about Deci and Ryan and I thought, This is how I want to live my life! This is so amazing. If I were to shape a life, this is what it would be. I knew I was on an alternative path with my toddler, just following his interests. When he was five, I made the decision to home-school because I could see his natural intrinsic motivation and curiosity about the world. I didn’t want to ruin it.’

64

Riley explained to me how she understands self-determination theory. ‘Deci and Ryan define intrinsic motivation as something that comes out of curiosity, that comes out of interest, that comes from within. This is the opposite of extrinsic motivation which comes from somewhere else. One of the most interesting parts of self-determination theory is their sub-theory which is “cognitive evaluation theory”. Cognitive evaluation theory describes the environmental tenets in which someone can facilitate intrinsic motivation in others. You can’t force it; you can only facilitate it.’

Intrinsic motivation cannot be manipulated using behavioural strategies. In fact, these are likely to damage it.

65

This has serious implications for the way in which most schools currently work. Schools reward children for their academic performance. If Deci and Ryan are right, in the process they may be destroying their intrinsic motivation for academic pursuits. A reliance on external rewards traps schools in an eternal loop. The more they use external rewards, the less people enjoy learning. And the less people enjoy learning, the more schools have to rely on external motivation.

65

Just like with that maths programme, once you’re doing it for stars or grades, the learning becomes secondary. You might as well get your mother to do it. Or copy your friend’s answers in the break. Whereas, if you’re learning for your own purposes, it would make no sense at all to get someone else to do it for you. In a very real sense, you would be cheating yourself. If you don’t want to do it, you can just stop.

65

Parents and schools are so immersed in behaviourism that sometimes it can be hard to think of alternatives – if you don’t give stickers and praise, then what do you do? Cognitive evaluation theory suggests what needs to be in place in order to facilitate intrinsic motivation. Riley told me how she brings this into her classroom, where she trains teachers who will work in the public school system.

65

‘The way you can facilitate it \[intrinsic motivation\] according to cognitive self-evaluation theory is by using the realm of competence, the realm of autonomy and the realm of relatedness. I talk to my students about competence; how to increase or facilitate competence in your students. We talk about things like making sure that our students really know their intrinsic strengths; what they are good at. Not rewarding or saying, “Good job . . .” but saying, “Oh my gosh, you are really a good writer . . .” not as a compliment but as genuine.

66

‘We talk about competence also as having students see small successes, that all helps. And those small successes are becoming bigger successes, and then success you are really able to see . . . “Hey, I’m good at this, I’m competent in what I’m doing and I’m good at it.” And you have to be careful because you can’t get too extrinsic about it, it’s about helping children or teens really see their authentic strengths.’

66

A word about autonomy: ‘autonomy’ is a person’s ability to choose their actions, based on their own values and interest. An autonomous child has (age-appropriate) governance over their own lives. Psychologists sometimes talk about agency, which is a related but slightly different idea. Agency is the knowledge that you can make decisions with consequences. Young children experiment with agency when they drop their plate and see it fall, or hit a pot and make a noise, but they are only autonomous when their environment provides them with the space freely to explore and to use their agency to learn. Autonomy is therefore both about the person (who needs to feel that they have the power to change things) and their environment (which needs to give them the opportunity to do so).

66

This means that parents and educators can either nurture or stifle autonomy, sometimes in unexpected ways. When a person’s preferences align with the opportunities in their environment, they will feel more autonomous. A very structured and apparently controlling environment may feel freeing for someone who does not want to be making day-to-day decisions, and who knows they can choose to leave if they want to. Hours of unstructured play in the forest can be wonderfully freeing for a child who loves making dens and dams. Another child will find the forest frustratingly limited in scope because they would prefer to be reading books, painting, or taking part in organised activities. For them, being in the forest is a very different experience and they will not feel autonomous unless they are able to leave when they choose.

67

Attempts to manipulate behaviour will inevitably affect autonomy. Under this, I include both rewards and punishments, since these are attempts to change behaviour in line with someone else’s values and interests. Emotional pressure will also harm a child’s abilities to make autonomous choices. Using shame to control children’s behaviour is so widespread that we may not even notice it. Techniques such as writing a child’s name on a board or making them sit outside the classroom use the gaze of others to create shame – and therefore to push the children to make choices based on trying to avoid that shameful feeling.

67

Riley sees these three realms as fundamental to self-directed education for both home-educated children and those in self-directed schools. Autonomy, which Deci is careful to distinguish from independence or individualism, can be facilitated by a parent making ‘autonomy-supportive’ responses; competence can be fostered by helping children recognise their strengths; and relatedness – well, Riley clearly feels that this is at the heart of self-directed education.

67

‘The last one, which I love because I come from attachment theory, is a sense of relatedness – and that’s really having someone who has your back, no matter what. That, of course, facilitates intrinsic motivation, because if you feel someone has your back, no matter what, then you can make all these choices without fearing mistakes. It’s unconditional autonomy support. That freedom of being unconditionally accepted, unconditionally related to – it doesn’t have to be a parent, it could be a teacher or someone else.’

67

If learning is intrinsically rewarding, then adding external motivators will make it less likely that people will want to continue once there are no more rewards. For example, when they finish school and can decide for themselves whether to go on reading books or not.

68

It’s not as simple as extrinsic motivators being detrimental while intrinsic motivation is good. Deci and Ryan have suggested that there is a spectrum of quality of motivation. The highest-quality motivation comes when we are intrinsically motivated, and the lowest when we are not motivated at all, which they call ‘amotivation’. In the middle, however, there are different types of regulation. The more a person feels controlled from outside themselves, the lower the quality of their motivation (and therefore engagement).

68

Alongside amotivation is ‘external regulation’ – this is when someone is made to do something by the threat of punishment or disaster. Motivating statements such as ‘If you don’t do, this then I’ll punish you’ fall into this category. The person feels they are being forced to do something. Next along the scale is ‘introjected regulation’. This involves doing something so that others don’t think badly of you; for example, thinking you need to perform well at school because everyone expects it. We then start to move along to less damaging forms of regulation: ‘identified regulation’ where a person values an activity because they feel the goals are worthwhile; and ‘integrated regulation’, where someone is doing something because it fits with their sense of themselves and the person they feel they are.

68

Figure 3.1 – Different types of regulation and their effect on motivation

68

Figure 3.1 is my interpretation of Deci and Ryan’s theory in the context of parenting and education. The attitude of the adults around children makes a huge difference to how they feel about what they do. And the quality of their motivation affects how engaged they are, which then affects their learning.

68

Of course, regulation can be mixed. Lucky people might do something they enjoy, but which is also aligned with their values. Unlucky people might be doing something they feel forced to do, and they feel guilty about it when they don’t do it.

The important thing about this theory is that it’s not enough to make children do something and to assume that they will learn. Children can be made to go through the motions, absolutely, but the quality of their motivation (and therefore their learning) will be affected by how they feel about what they are doing.

70

The joy often disappears when we have no choice. It’s the same with walks in the forest, cooking a meal or learning a foreign language. When it’s chosen, it is rewarding; when it’s compulsory, it is tedious and time-consuming.

72

This is something that Kevin Currie-Knight is acutely aware of. He’s an ex-secondary school teacher, who now trains teachers at East Carolina College of Education. When thinking about how to plan his classes for his trainees, he was chewing on the puzzle of motivation. He was thinking particularly of video games. Video games are difficult, often repetitive and it can take hours and hours to get good at a particular game. And yet video games are an area where motivation is not a problem. In fact, for many people, the problem is that children are too motivated to play video games. If only, they say, they could put that motivation into school.

73

‘So what researchers noticed,’ observed Kevin Currie-Knight, ‘is that video game manufacturers seem to have cracked the code that educators have been trying to crack for hundreds of years, which is how do you get kids to stay so motivated to learn this thing that they will repeatedly and voluntarily have failure after failure. We’re trying to do this . . . how do you do this?’

For Currie-Knight, it boiled down to three things – video games combined learning, practice and evaluation in rapid succession, whereas schools separate out those things. Children can freely choose to play or not play video games, whereas at school they have no choice. And finally, children only play video games if they are interested. When they are no longer interested, they stop. They are autonomous.

73

He decided to experiment with his college students, to see if he could change their experience of his course by changing those parameters. The course is a compulsory one, and students have to pass it in order to become teachers, which put him at an immediate disadvantage as compared to video games. However, he decided to do what he could.

73

‘So, I started dipping my toe very gradually in my own teaching. Instead of assigning tests and a teacher-assigned project with parameters, why don’t I give them choices for a project? So, I started with six different ways you can do your project, and that worked well but, at some point, I was like, “Why am I limiting them to six? Why don’t I just tell them – the only parameter for this project is to demonstrate to me somehow that you have got the main points of this unit . . . that’s it!”

74

‘And it just got better. I wasn’t expecting that; I thought at some point it would go really badly. I imagined that students would low-ball their projects, just pick whatever the easiest thing is. What I found was almost the opposite . . . I mean, there’s not an objective way for me to measure this, but my experience was they turned in projects that were bigger, longer. One student who is an art education major decided that she was going to do a painting that represents all of the themes in a particular relationship, and then she wrote about a page-long description about what each of the elements is and why it’s there, and how that reflects what we did in the course. I don’t think that anyone would ever have put in that amount of time.’

Motivation soared, and so did performance, even within the restrictions of a compulsory course.

74

Currie-Knight’s experiments have raised some concerns from his colleagues that his students might have gaps in their knowledge. After all, he’s letting them choose what they do. Surely it would be better just to teach them the curriculum?

‘My concern with that question is that I think it’s a very jaundiced view of how learning works,’ Currie-Knight says. ‘The idea is just like with K-12 \[the publically supported education system from Kindergarten to twelfth grade in the States\] that you fill kids with all the knowledge that you think they’re going to need once they go out because, once they go out, if they have gaps in their knowledge, they’re not going to be able to remedy those gaps.

74

‘So, there are several problems with that. The first is that it’s just not the world we live in any more. In 1935, if I missed something and I went out into the world and I couldn’t find the resource somewhere, like in the library or from a friend, I would be in trouble. But nowadays, that’s not as much of a concern.

‘The second problem is that there seems to be an assumption within that question that suggests: if you teach it, students will come out knowing it. It’s assumed that if we teach the same syllabus, people will come out knowing the same things. There’s a fair amount of research that shows that students do an astonishing amount of forgetting. So when people say, “Your students are going to have gaps in their knowledge,” my response is, “So are all the others.”

75

Currie-Knight isn’t the first person to be surprised by the behaviour of his students. Cathy N. Davidson, who was then Vice-Provost for Interdisciplinary Studies at Duke University, described in her book what she called a huge ‘educational experiment’ with the first-year students at Duke in 2003. Every student was given a free iPod, with no conditions. They asked students to think of ideas for learning applications and pitch their ideas to staff. That was it. At the time, there were no educational apps at all for the iPod and, of course, no iPhones or iPads. Later, they said that any student in any year could have a free iPod if they could convince their professor to use a learning app in their class.

75

The press coverage was scathing. iPods were seen as frivolous entertainment, not as learning devices. And then the ideas from the students started coming. The first podcasts were broadcast, iPods were used to share ideas between students and to give and receive feedback; iPods were used to aid medical diagnosis, and to practise musical performance. It was beyond anything that anyone had expected.

75

It was more than an exciting educational project for students, however. This had implications for how iPods and similar devices were seen. What had previously been perceived as a sophisticated entertainment device suddenly became something with the potential to open up access to learning for people across the world.

76

Motivation was not a problem here. These students were given more autonomy than in any other course, and they came alive with ideas and learning. There was no curriculum, and everyone could join in, not just the computer scientists and engineers. There was no reward for those first-year students at all – they already had their iPods.

We all know how this story ended. Thousands of educational apps are used every day on iPad and iPhones all over the world.

No assessments, no assignments, no tests, nothing keeping them on task. From a behavioural perspective, they shouldn’t have bothered – what was the point? And yet they did. They came up with ideas and applications which transformed education and technology.
