## The right hemisphere allows for exploratory attention, while the left only focuses on what’s already been prioritized

Essentially the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)'s narrow attention ([The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention](The%20right%20hemisphere%20has%20broad,%20global,%20and%20flexible%20attention,%20while%20the%20left%20has%20narrow%20attention.md)), which it believes it directs towards whatever it may be, has in reality already been seized by the right. It is thus the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) that has dominance for exploratory attentional movements, while the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) assists in focussed grasping of what has already been prioritized. It is the right hemisphere that controls where that attention is to be oriented.
