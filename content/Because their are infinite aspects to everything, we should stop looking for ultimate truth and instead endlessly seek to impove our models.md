## Because their are infinite aspects to everything, we should stop looking for ultimate truth and instead endlessly seek to impove our models

* we should become [model agnostics](Model%20Agnosticism.md) and care only about the utility our models currently serve

The [Meta-Programming Circuit](Meta-Programming%20Circuit.md) is not a trap. Simply accept that the universe is so structured that it can see itself, and that this self-reflexive arc is built into our [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md)s, so that consciousness contains an [infinite regress](Infinite%20Regress.md), and all we can do is make models of ourselves making models¬†... Well, at that point, the only thing to do is relax and enjoy the show. Since there are infinite aspects to everything, especially to the ‚Äúyou‚Äù who is observing/creating all these muddles and models, there are no limits. The only sensible goal, then, is to try to build a [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) for next week that is bigger, funnier, sexier, more optimistic and generally less boring than any previous [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md). And once you have built that bigger, funnier, happier universe of thought, build a bigger and better one for next month.
