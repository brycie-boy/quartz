## Abraham Flexner  # 

Abraham Flexner was an American educator, best known for his role in the 20th century reform of medical and higher education in the United States and Canada. Abraham got his undergraduate degree after two years at Johns Hopkins, where he was exposed to this German academic paradigm ([[Johns Hopkins medical school adopted the German educational structure in the late 19th century in an attempt to establish itself as a beacon of evidence-based medicine and science]]). He readily adopted it and put this organizational structure into practice when he opened his own college preparatory school back in Louisville. Abraham did quite well both administratively and financially, and used his knowledge of education and running a school to write a seminal work denoting the flaws in American higher education, entitled The American College: A Criticism (1908).
