## A dopamine release occurs when we explore and evaluate the potential value of novel objects and situations

The [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) and their connections with other [brain](Brain.md) circuits are also active when we explore novel objects and situations and evaluate them in light of previous reinforcing experiences. In other words, nerve fibers in the [ventral tegmental area](Ventral%20tegmental%20area.md) are triggering [dopamine](Dopamine.md) release in the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md) when a person needs to know, ‚ÄúIs this new whatever-it-is going to help me or hurt me? Will I like it or not?‚Äù The role of the [dopamine](Dopamine.md) system in novelty-seeking helps explain why some people are driven to risky behaviors such as street racing. It‚Äôs one way to experience the excitement of [dopamine](Dopamine.md) release.
