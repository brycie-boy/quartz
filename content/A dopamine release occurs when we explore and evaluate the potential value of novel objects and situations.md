## A dopamine release occurs when we explore and evaluate the potential value of novel objects and situations  # 

The [[mesolimbic pathway]] and their connections with other [[brain]] circuits are also active when we explore novel objects and situations and evaluate them in light of previous reinforcing experiences. In other words, nerve fibers in the [[ventral tegmental area]] are triggering [[dopamine]] release in the [[nucleus accumbens]] when a person needs to know, ‚ÄúIs this new whatever-it-is going to help me or hurt me? Will I like it or not?‚Äù The role of the [[dopamine]] system in novelty-seeking helps explain why some people are driven to risky behaviors such as street racing. It‚Äôs one way to experience the excitement of [[dopamine]] release.
