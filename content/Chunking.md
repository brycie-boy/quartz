## Chunking

* Chunking is a process by which small individual pieces of a set of information are bound together to create a meaningful whole later on in memory.
* The chunks, by which the information is grouped, are meant to improve short-term retention of the material, thus bypassing the limited capacity of [working memory](Working%20memory.md) and allowing the [working memory](Working%20memory.md) to be more efficient. A chunk is a collection of basic units that are strongly associated with one another, and have been grouped together and stored in a person's memory. These chunks can be retrieved easily due to their coherent grouping. During the chunking process, the [basal ganglia](Basal%20ganglia.md) converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine. it is at the root of how [habit](Habit.md)s form.
