## Chunking # 

- Chunking is a process by which small individual pieces of a set of information are bound together to create a meaningful whole later on in memory.
- The chunks, by which the information is grouped, are meant to improve short-term retention of the material, thus bypassing the limited capacity of [[working memory]] and allowing the [[working memory]] to be more efficient. A chunk is a collection of basic units that are strongly associated with one another, and have been grouped together and stored in a person's memory. These chunks can be retrieved easily due to their coherent grouping. During the chunking process, the [[basal ganglia]] converts a sequence of actions into an automatic routine. it is at the root of how [[habit]]s form.
