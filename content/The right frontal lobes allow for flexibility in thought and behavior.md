## The right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior # 

Since [[novelty is handled by the right hemisphere, and is transferred to the left hemisphere as it becomes familiar]], the [[right hemisphere]] is more capable of a shift in perspective, and not surprisingly the right [[frontal lobe]] is especially important for flexibility of thought, with damage in that area leading to perseveration, a pathological inability to respond flexibly to changing situations. For example, having found an approach that works for one problem, subjects seem to get stuck, and will inappropriately apply it to a second problem that requires a different approach‚Äîor even, having answered one question right, will give the same answer to the next and the next. It is the right [[orbitofrontal cortex]] that is responsible for inhibiting one's immediate response, and hence for flexibility and set-shifting, as well as the power of inhibiting immediate response to environmental stimuli.
