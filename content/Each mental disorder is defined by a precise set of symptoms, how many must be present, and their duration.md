## Each mental disorder is defined by a precise set of symptoms, how many must be present, and their duration # 

[[Mental disorder and and normality are too ambiguous to distinguish between]], but although we can’t develop a useful definition for the general concept “[[mental disorder]],” it is balanced by the very good news that we can quite easily define each one of the specific [[mental disorder]]s. The method, introduced by [[DSM]]-III in 1980, is simple and effective. The description of each [[DSM]] disorder is accompanied by a criteria set that lists in fairly precise terms which symptoms define it, how many must be present, and their required duration.

There are about two hundred criteria sets in the [[DSM]]—one for each [[mental disorder]]. These establish the boundaries that separate the [[mental disorder]]s from one another and from normality. Each criteria set has the symptoms that define that particular disorder (panic, [[anxiety]], [[obsessive-compulsive]], [[ADHD]], [[autism]], etc.) and the required threshold. When clinicians follow the criteria, they achieve reasonable agreement. Without them, there is poor agreement. Each clinician becomes a law unto himself, and the result is a confusing Babel of clashing, idiosyncratic voices.
