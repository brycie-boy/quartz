## Each mental disorder is defined by a precise set of symptoms, how many must be present, and their duration

[Mental disorder and and normality are too ambiguous to distinguish between](Mental%20disorder%20and%20and%20normality%20are%20too%20ambiguous%20to%20distinguish%20between.md), but although we can‚Äôt develop a useful definition for the general concept ‚Äú[mental disorder](),‚Äù it is balanced by the very good news that we can quite easily define each one of the specific [mental disorder]()s. The method, introduced by [DSM]()-III in 1980, is simple and effective. The description of each [DSM]() disorder is accompanied by a criteria set that lists in fairly precise terms which symptoms define it, how many must be present, and their required duration.

There are about two hundred criteria sets in the [DSM]()‚Äîone for each [mental disorder](). These establish the boundaries that separate the [mental disorder]()s from one another and from normality. Each criteria set has the symptoms that define that particular disorder (panic, [anxiety](), [obsessive-compulsive](), [ADHD](ADHD.md), [autism](), etc.) and the required threshold. When clinicians follow the criteria, they achieve reasonable agreement. Without them, there is poor agreement. Each clinician becomes a law unto himself, and the result is a confusing Babel of clashing, idiosyncratic voices.
