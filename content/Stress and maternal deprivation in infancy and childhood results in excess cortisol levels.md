## Stress and maternal deprivation in infancy and childhood results in excess cortisol levels

Maternal deprivation and other types of adversity during infancy and childhood result in chronically high levels of [cortisol](Cortisol.md). In addition to the fact that [Insufficient social-emotional stimulation in infancy reduces the growth of dopamine neurons and receptors](Insufficient%20social-emotional%20stimulation%20in%20infancy%20reduces%20the%20growth%20of%20dopamine%20neurons%20and%20receptors.md) by excess [cortisol](Cortisol.md), [Elevated levels of cortisol can shrink the hippocampus](Elevated%20levels%20of%20cortisol%20can%20shrink%20the%20hippocampus.md) and disturbs normal [brain](Brain.md) development in many other ways, with lifelong repercussions.10 Another major stress chemical that‚Äôs permanently overproduced after insufficient early maternal contact is [vasopressin](), which is implicated in high blood pressure.11
