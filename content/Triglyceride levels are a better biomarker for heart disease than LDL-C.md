## Triglyceride levels are a better biomarker for heart disease than LDL-C

Your fasting [lipid]() profile test also measures a particle other than [LDL](), which is much more egregious—[triglyceride]()s. The level of these particles tells you how your [liver]() is doing. The high risk ratio for [triglyceride]()s and [heart disease]() is 1.8 (meaning that if they’re high, you have an 80 percent increased risk for [heart attack]()) compared to [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) at 1.3. 

Further, the main reason for high [triglyceride]()s has nothing to do with [LDL-C](LDL-C.md); rather, it’s the refined [carbohydrate](Carbohydrate.md)s and sugars in your diet. Again, the #1 risk factor for [heart disease]() isn’t [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) (see [Relatively high LDL-C doesn't usually lead to a heart attack for most people](Relatively%20high%20LDL-C%20doesn't%20usually%20lead%20to%20a%20heart%20attack%20for%20most%20people.md)); it’s the [insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md) of [metabolic syndrome](Metabolic%20syndrome.md), of which [triglyceride]() is a much better biomarker than [LDL-C](LDL-C.md). 

In fact, the largest study of [heart attack]()s in the US revealed that 66 percent of the victims had [metabolic syndrome](Metabolic%20syndrome.md). And the primary driver? [Insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md). And its primary driver? Our out-of-control sugar consumption. [Insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md) can be in part measured by your [triglyceride]() level, which is a better predictor of death by [heart attack]() than high [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) ever was.
