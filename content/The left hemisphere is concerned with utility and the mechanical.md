## The left hemisphere is concerned with utility and the mechanical  # 

Not only is [[the right hemisphere is concerned with living things and the left with the non-living]], but the [[left hemisphere]] also has an affinity for what is mechanical. The [[left hemisphere]]'s principal concern is utility. It is interested in what it has made, and in the world as a resource to be used. It is therefore natural that it has a particular affinity for words and concepts for tools, man-made things, mechanisms and whatever is not alive. The [[left hemisphere]] codes for tools and machines.

References to tools and actions of grasping activate the [[left hemisphere]] even in left-handers, despite the fact that they habitually use the [[right hemisphere]]/left hand to grasp objects and use tools in daily life. And [[right hemisphere]] damage leaves the ability to use simple tools unaltered, whereas [[left hemisphere]] damage renders the sufferer incapable of using a hammer and nail, or a key and a padlock. However, [[right hemisphere]] damage particularly impairs naturalistic actions involving a sequence of steps‚Äîfor example, making a cup of coffee or wrapping a present.
