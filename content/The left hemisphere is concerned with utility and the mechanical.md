## The left hemisphere is concerned with utility and the mechanical

Not only is [the right hemisphere is concerned with living things and the left with the non-living](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20concerned%20with%20living%20things%20and%20the%20left%20with%20the%20non-living.md), but the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) also has an affinity for what is mechanical. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)'s principal concern is utility. It is interested in what it has made, and in the world as a resource to be used. It is therefore natural that it has a particular affinity for words and concepts for tools, man-made things, mechanisms and whatever is not alive. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) codes for tools and machines.

References to tools and actions of grasping activate the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) even in left-handers, despite the fact that they habitually use the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)/left hand to grasp objects and use tools in daily life. And [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) damage leaves the ability to use simple tools unaltered, whereas [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) damage renders the sufferer incapable of using a hammer and nail, or a key and a padlock. However, [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) damage particularly impairs naturalistic actions involving a sequence of steps‚Äîfor example, making a cup of coffee or wrapping a present.
