The true world โ attainable for the sage, the pious, the virtuous man; he lives in it, he is it.

(The oldest form of the idea, relatively sensible, simple, and persuasive. A circumlocution for the sentence, โI, Plato, am the truth.โ)

20

The true world โ unattainable for now, but promised for the sage, the pious, the virtuous man (โfor the sinner who repentsโ).

(Progress of the idea: it becomes more subtle, insidious, incomprehensible โ it becomes female, it becomes Christian. )

20

The true world โ unattainable, indemonstrable, unpromisable; but the very thought of it โ a consolation, an obligation, an imperative.

(At bottom, the old sun, but seen through mist and skepticism. The idea has become elusive, pale, Nordic, Kรถnigsbergian.)

20

The true world โ unattainable? At any rate, unattained. And being unattained, also unknown. Consequently, not consoling, redeeming, or obligating: how could something unknown obligate us?

(Gray morning. The first yawn of reason. The cockcrow of positivism.)

20

The โtrueโ world โ an idea which is no longer good for anything, not even obligating โ an idea which has become useless and superfluous โ consequently, a refuted idea: let us abolish it!

(Bright day; breakfast; return of bon sens and cheerfulness; Platoโs embarrassed blush; pandemonium of all free spirits.)

20

The true world โ we have abolished. What world has remained? The apparent one perhaps? But no! With the true world we have also abolished the apparent one.

(Noon; moment of the briefest shadow; end of the longest error; high point of humanity; INCIPIT ZARATHUSTRA.)
