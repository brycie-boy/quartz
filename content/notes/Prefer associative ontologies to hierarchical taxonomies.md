## Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies # 

Let structure emerge organically and [[self-organization|self-organize]]. When it‚Äôs imposed from the start, you prematurely constrain what may emerge and artificially compress the nuanced relationships between ideas (Contra [[non-forcing]]). We generally take a [[left hemisphere]] approach to organization: [[the right hemisphere recognizes and groups things by comparing them with an exemplar whereas the left recognizes things by categories]]. Our file systems, organizational structures, and libraries suggest that hierarchical categories are the natural structure of the world. But often items belong in many places, and items relate to other items in very different hierarchical categories, so it may be better to take the [[right hemisphere]] approach.

Worse, by presorting things into well-specified categories, we necessarily fuzz their edges. Things don‚Äôt always fit _exactly_. Maybe once enough new ideas are collected, a new category would emerge‚Ä¶ except you can‚Äôt see its shape because everything‚Äôs already been sorted. And because everything‚Äôs already been sorted, further sorting requires undoing existing structure. It‚Äôs better to let networks of related ideas to gradually emerge. Once you can see the shape, then you can think about its character. This can help us utilize the [[right hemisphere]] more
