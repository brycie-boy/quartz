## Stress causes the HPA axis to quite the prefrontal cortex by flooding it with dopamine and cortisol #🧠 

In a stressful situation, the [[amygdala]]–[[HPA axis]] commands the release of [[neurotransmitter]]s including [[dopamine]]. These flood the [[prefrontal cortex]], quieting it, which disinhibits you. When your [[prefrontal cortex]] is under fire by [[cortisol]], your rational decision-making ability is toast. You can’t differentiate between immediate or delayed gratification and you are much more likely to react on impulse.
