## Stream-entry #

Stream-entry is the first of [[the four stages of awakening]].  This stage involves the eradication of the first three fetters, which are [[Identity view]], doubt, and the wrong grasp of rules and observances; the belief that mere external observances, paticularly religious rituals and ascetic practices, can lead to liberation. The stream enterer is assured of attaining [[Nibbana]] in atmost seven more existences, which may take place in [[The sense-sphere realm]]s.
