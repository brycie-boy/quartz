## The employer does not pay a skilled worker more do to the cost of production, but due to personal intrest  # 

As to the employer who pays an professional worker twenty times more than a simple worker, it is simply due to personal interest; if the engineer can economize $4,000 a year on the cost of production, the employer pays them $800. And if the employer has a foreman who saves $400 on the work by cleverly sweating workers, they would gladly give them $80 or $120 a year. They would part with an extra $40 when they expect to gain $400 by it; and this is the essence of the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] system. 

Let the collectivists, therefore, not talk to us of ‚Äòthe cost of production‚Äô which raises the cost of skilled labour, and tell us that someone who went to university has a right to a [[wage]] ten times greater than an entry level worker. The professional worker simply benefits by the advantages their industry reaps in international trade, from countries that have as yet no industries, and in consequence of the privileges accorded by all [[state]]s to industries in preference to the other trades.

Nobody has ever calculated the cost of production of a producer; and if a noble loafer costs far more to society than a worker, it remains to be seen whether a robust day-labourer does not cost more to society than a skilled worker. We know full well that people work for less, but we also know that they do so exclusively because, thanks to our wonderful economic organization, they would die of hunger did they not accept these mediocre wages. For us the scale of remuneration is a complex result of taxes, of governmental tutelage, and of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] monopoly. In a word, of [[state]] and [[capital]]. Therefore, I say that all [[wage]] theories have been invented after the event to justify injustices existing at present, and that we shouldn't take them into consideration.
