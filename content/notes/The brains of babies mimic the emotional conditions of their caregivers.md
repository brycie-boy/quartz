## The brains of babies mimic the emotional conditions of their caregivers  # 

The electrical activity of the infant’s [[brain]] is exquisitely sensitive to that of the nurturing adult. A study at the University of Washington in Seattle compared the brain-wave patterns of two groups of six-month-old infants: one group whose mothers were suffering postpartum [[depression]] and one group whose mothers were in normal good spirits. [[EEG]]s showed consistent, marked differences between the two groups: the babies of the depressed mothers had [[EEG]] patterns characteristic of [[depression]] even during interactions with their mothers that were meant to elicit a joyful response. Significantly, these effects were noted only in the [[frontal lobe]]s.

How does this pertain to [[brain]] development? Repeatedly firing [[neuron]] patterns become wired into the [[brain]] and will form part of a person’s habitual responses to the world. In the words of the great Canadian neuroscientist [[Donald Hebb]], “cells that fire together, wire together.” The infants of stressed or depressed parents are likely to encode negative emotional patterns in their [[brain]]s. The long-term effect of parental mood on the biology of the child’s [[brain]] is illustrated by several studies showing that concentrations of [[cortisol]] are elevated in the children of clinically depressed mothers. At age three, the highest [[cortisol]] levels were found in those children whose mothers had been depressed during the child’s first year of life, rather than later

Thus we see that the [[brain]] is “experience-dependent.” Good experiences lead to healthy [[brain]] development, while the absence of good experiences or the presence of bad ones distorts development in essential [[brain]] structures. An abnormal or impoverished rearing environment can decrease a thousand fold the number of [[synapse]]s per [[axon]], retard growth and eliminate billions if not trillions of [[synapse]]s per [[brain]], and result in the preservation of abnormal interconnections which are normally discarded over the course of development
