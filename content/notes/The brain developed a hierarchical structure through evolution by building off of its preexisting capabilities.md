## The brain developed a hierarchical structure through evolution by building off of its preexisting capabilities  # 

Life began around 3.5 billion years ago. Multicelled creatures first appeared about 650 million years ago. (When you get a cold, remember that microbes had nearly a three-billion-year head-start!) By the time the earliest jellyfish arose about 600 million years ago, animals had grown complex enough that their sensory and motor systems needed to communicate with each other; thus the beginnings of neural tissue. As animals evolved, so did their nervous systems, which slowly developed a central headquarters in the form of a [[brain]]. The [[brain]] is a hierarchical system. Evolution builds on preexisting capabilities. Life‚Äôs progression can be seen inside your own [[brain]]. The highest-level parts‚Äîthose developed late in our evolution, typically located in the [[cortex]]‚Äîexert an inhibitory influence on the lower-level [[limbic system]] and [[emotional-territorial circuit]]. Cortical tissues that are relatively recent, complex, conceptualizing, slow, and motivationally diffuse sit atop subcortical and [[brain stem]] structures that are ancient, simplistic, concrete, fast, and motivationally intense.
