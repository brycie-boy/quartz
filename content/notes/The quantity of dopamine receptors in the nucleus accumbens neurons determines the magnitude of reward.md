## The quantity of dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens neurons determines the magnitude of reward  #üß† 

After [[dopamine]] is released from the [[ventral tegmental area]]s [[axon]]al terminals, it travels across the [[synapse]], where it binds to a [[dopamine]] [[receptor]] on the [[nucleus accumbens]] [[neuron]]s and exites it, causing the [[nucleus accumbens]] to fire, releasing [[opioid peptide]]s and generating reward. The number of [[receptor]]s determines the magnitude of the reward. More functional [[dopamine]] [[receptor]]s means a higher chance that any given [[dopamine]] molecule will find a [[receptor]] to bind to, and therefore more reward signaling even in the face of less [[dopamine]] released. 

But if the number of [[receptor]]s is reduced, then each [[dopamine]] molecule has less of a chance to find a [[receptor]] to bind to, and therefor will generate less reward. Also, [[there must be a balanced amount of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway to prevent lethargy or irritablility]], and things that change [[receptor]] number will influence you're [[dopamine]] balance.
