## Neural activity changes in accordance with mental activity  # 

When your mind changes, your [[brain]] changes, too. In the saying from the work of the psychologist [[Donald Hebb]]: when [[neuron]]s fire together, they wire together‚Äîmental activity actually creates new neural structures ([[Synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened through life experiences and frequency of use]]). "Mind" and"body" are not two seperate things, but are a [[mind-body]] unity. As a result, even fleeting thoughts and feelings can leave lasting marks on your [[brain]], much like a spring shower can leave little trails on a hillside. 

Conscious mental events are based on temporary coalitions of [[synapse]]s that form and disperse‚Äîusually within seconds‚Äîlike eddies in a stream. [[Neuron]]s can also make lasting circuits, strengthening their connections to each other as a result of mental activity. For example, taxi drivers in London‚Äîwhose job requires remembering lots of twisty streets‚Äîdevelop a larger [[hippocampus]]. As you become a happier person, the left frontal region of your [[brain]] becomes more active. 

What flows through your mind sculpts your [[brain]]. Thus, you can use your mind to change your [[brain]] for the better. The mind and [[brain]] interact with each other so profoundly that they‚Äôre best understood as a single, co-dependent, mind/[[brain]] system. Ignorace of this is due to the mind-body [[dualism]] which has coloured Western thinking from [[Plato]] onwards, in which the immaterial and material aspects of the universe were thought of as separate and incompatible.
