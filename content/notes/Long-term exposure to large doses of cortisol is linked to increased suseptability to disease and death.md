## Long-term exposure to large doses of cortisol is linked to increased suseptability to disease and death # 

Acute, short-term [[cortisol]] release is both necessary for survival and is actually good for you. It increases vigilance, improves memory and immune function, and redirects blood flow to fuel the muscles, heart, and brain. Your body is designed for [[cortisol]] to be released in any given stressful situation, but in small doses and in short bursts. Long-term exposure to large doses of [[cortisol]] will kill you ‚Ä¶ but slowly. When pressures are relentless, your [[cortisol]] response can remain elevated for days, months, or years. Evidence of the associations between job stress, psychological distress, elevated [[cortisol]], depression, and disease is extremely compelling. Psychological stress in adolescence is directly linked to the risk of heart attack3 and diabetes4 in adulthood.
