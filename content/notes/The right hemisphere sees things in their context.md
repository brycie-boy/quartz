## The right hemisphere sees things in their context  # 

For the same reason that [[the right hemisphere sees the whole before the left hemisphere separates it into parts]], the [[right hemisphere]] also sees each thing in its context, as standing in a qualifying relationship with all that surrounds it, rather than taking it as a single isolated entity. Anything that requires indirect interpretation, which is not explicit or literal, that in other words requires contextual understanding, depends on the right [[frontal lobe]] for its meaning to be conveyed or received. The [[right hemisphere]] understands from indirect contextual clues, not only from explicit statement, whereas the [[left hemisphere]] will identify by labels rather than context (e.g. identifies that it must be winter because it is ‘January’, not by looking at the trees).
