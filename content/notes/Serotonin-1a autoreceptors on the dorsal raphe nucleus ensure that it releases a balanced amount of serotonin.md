## Serotonin-1a autoreceptors on the dorsal raphe nucleus ensure that it releases a balanced amount of serotonin  # 

[[Serotonin]] [[neuron]]s in the [[dorsal raphe nucleus]] possess an extra control system: they express a set of [[serotonin]]-1a [[autoreceptor]]s on the presynaptic side. These [[receptor]]s normally serve as a feedback loop that regulates how frequently that [[neuron]] fires. It’s like the servo-mechanism of the thermostat in your house. When the temperature drops, the thermostat kicks the heat on, and when it gets too hot, the furnace turns off. The-1a [[autoreceptor]] serves as the [[neuron]]’s thermostat, causing it to fire relatively slowly and rhythmically, and silencing it before it gets into trouble. By preventing these [[neuron]]s from firing too rapidly, these [[autoreceptor]]s make sure the [[serotonin]] [[neuron]]s don’t wear out; and there is rarely enough [[serotonin]] in the [[synapse]] to down-regulate those-1a autoreceptors. SSRIs turn those [[autoreceptor]]s off; it’s like setting the temperature threshold on your servo-mechanism thermostat much higher, and those [[serotonin]] nerve terminals fire like gangbusters; thus the antidepressant effects.
