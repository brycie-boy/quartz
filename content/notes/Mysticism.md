## Mysticism  # 

Mysticism refers to traditions and practices which aim at the disillusion of the sense of a seperate isolated self, or [[Identity view]], and to bring a sense of interconnnectness with the larger universe, and union with an Absolute principle (i.e. [[Nibbana]]). This is often refered to as a mystical experience.
