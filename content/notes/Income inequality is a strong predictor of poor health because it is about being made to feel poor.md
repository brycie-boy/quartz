## Income inequality is a strong predictor of poor health because it is about being made to feel poor # 

In many ways, an even more accurate tag line for the phenomena in which [[stress-related disease among the poor usually has more to do with feeling poor than actually being poor]] is that it is about _being made_ to feel poor. This point is made clearer when considering the second body of research in this area, championed by [[Richard Wilkinson]] of the University of Nottingham in England. Wilkinson took a top-down approach, looking at the ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù ladder from the societal level.

Let‚Äôs consider how answers to ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù can be distributed along the ladder. Suppose there is a business with ten employees. Each earns $5.50 an hour. Thus the company is paying out a total of $55/hour in salary, and the average income is $5.50/hour. With that distribution, the wealthiest employee is making $5.50/hour, or 10 percent of the total income ($5.50/$55). Meanwhile, in the next business, there are also ten employees. One earns $1/hour, the next $2/hour, the next $3, and so on. Once again, the company pays a total of $55/hour in salary, and the average salary is again $5.50/hour. But now the wealthiest employee, earning $10/ hour, takes home 18 percent of the total income ($10/$55). Now, in the third company, nine of the employees earn $l/hour, and the tenth earns $46/hour. Again, the company pays a total of $55/hour, and the average salary is $5.50/hour. And here, the wealthiest employee takes home 84 percent of the total income ($46/$55). What we have here are businesses of increasingly unequal incomes. What Wilkinson and others have shown is that poverty is not only a predictor of poor health but, independent of absolute income, so is poverty amid plenty‚Äîthe more income inequality there is in a society, the worse the health and mortality rates.

This has been shown repeatedly, and at multiple levels. For example, income inequality predicts higher infant mortality rates across a bunch of European countries. Income inequality predicts mortality rates across all ages (except the elderly) in the United States, whether you consider this at the level of states or cities. In a world of science often filled with wishy-washy data, the effect is extremely reliable‚Äîincome inequality across American states is a really strong predictor of mortality rates among working men. When you compare the most egalitarian state, New Hampshire, with the least egalitarian, Louisiana, the latter has about a 60 percent higher mortality rate. Finally, Canada is both markedly more egalitarian and healthier than the United States‚Äîdespite being a ‚Äúpoorer‚Äù country.
