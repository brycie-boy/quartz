## Being directly aware and involved in what we are doing can increase our intelligence and creativity # 

It seems that the [[brain]] works best under pressure. The solder being decorated for bravery often says "i don't remember doing it‚Äîit all happened too fast." Even in situations less terrifying and punishing than war, most of us have experienced this staggering efficiency and rapidity of [[brain]] processes in emergencies. [[The global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]]. It seems very likely that [[habit]]ual feelings of helplessness and inadequacy derive chiefly from into the "real" universe in our [[left hemisphere]] and not being directly involved in where we are, what is going on around us, and what we are doing. 

To use the [[brain]] efficiently‚Äîto be [[mindfulness|mindful]] of where one is, what is going on within and around one, having a [[clear comprehension of activities]], and to take responsibility for ones choices and perceptual bets ([[each perception that we make is best considered to be a gamble rather than a certainty]])‚Äîseems to increase "intelligence" and "creativity." This is hardly a surprise. Whatever our technical definitions of these mysterious functions, it is obvious that they are connected to the number of signals consciously apprehended, and with the rapidity of the revision process. When the [[left hemisphere]] holds a single model statistically between us and our experience, the amount of signals drops, no revision occurs, and "intelligence" and "creativity" correspondingly decline. But [[the right hemisphere can consider multiple ambiguous possibilities and interpretations, whereas the left hemisphere jumps to premature conclusions]]. When many models are available, when we are consciously invovled in our choices, the number of signals consciously apprehended increases, and we behave more "intelligently" and "creatively."
