## High insulin levels cause diabetes rather than high blood glucose itself # 

[[Diabetes]] is not really about [[blood glucose]]. [[Blood glucose]] is just the indirect measurable proxy for the real culprit‚Äîwhich is the blood [[insulin]] level. [[Insulin]] is the real bad guy in this story‚Äîit is its own risk factor, and while high [[blood glucose]] can trigger an [[insulin]] response, most of the time your blood [[insulin]] is unrelated to [[blood glucose]].  We know this at a basic molecular level, because of seminal mouse studies done by Dr. [[C. Ron Kahn]]‚Äôs lab at Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.

Kahn‚Äôs lab constructed eight separate tissue-specific [[insulin]] [[receptor]] knockout (IRKO) models. Each mouse was genetically engineered to be missing their [[insulin]] [[receptor]] in a different [[organ]] (normally, both mice and humans have [[[insulin]] [[receptor]]s in every [[organ]]), and therefore [[insulin]] has different effects in each mouse. The scientists took the [[insulin]] [[receptor]] out of the [[liver]], [[brain]], [[fat]] [[cell]]s, brown [[adipose tissue]], muscle, beta-[[cell]]s, [[vascular smooth muscle]], or [[kidney]]. Each mouse developed some form of pathology, none were healthy. But the pathologies were all different from each other.

Interestingly, only the [[liver]] and the [[brain]] IRKO mice developed high [[blood glucose]], and only the [[brain]] IRKO mouse became obese and developed [[metabolic syndrome]]. And even more interestingly, the [[kidney]] IRKO mouse had normal [[blood glucose]], but developed diabetic [[kidney]] disease anyway. These various mice show that the cause of the disease is not the high [[blood glucose]]‚Äîit‚Äôs the [[insulin]]! And this isn‚Äôt just in mice‚Äîwe know this is true in humans as well. Because when people with type 1 [[diabetes]] ([[insulin]] deficiency) are diagnosed, they have normal [[kidney]]s, and it takes about ten to twenty years of bad [[glucose]] control before they develop [[kidney]] disease. Yet, people with [[metabolic syndrome]] ([[Insulin resistance|insulin resistant]]) already have [[kidney]] disease even before their [[glucose]] levels start to rise. Again, [[modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it]]. The reason for this dichotomy is because [[insulin can be both good and bad for you]].
