## Focus on systems instead of goals  # 

[[Breakthrough moments are the result of the compounding of incremental actions]], but prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life is to set specific, actionable goals. But our results usually have very little to do with the goals we set and nearly everything to do with the systems we followed. Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner [[Bill Walsh]], ‚ÄúThe score takes care of itself.‚Äù The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

Reasons for focusing systems rather than goals include:

- [[Setting goals leaves you continuously putting your satisfaction off until the next milestone]]
- [[Completing a goal only provides temporary change, while systems maintain continuous progress]]
- [[After we accomplish a goal, we have nothing to motivate us to continue working]]
