Greetings traveler!👋 My name is [[Bryce McAlister]]. You have happened to stumble across The Cosmos. The Cosmos is, in short, my thinking, learning and writing environment. It is primarily where i engage in [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit exercises]]. Or in other words, It is here that I dive into the depths of the chaotic universe that is my mind and attempt to emerge with coherent insights to share with the world.

Here are some places where you can take a deeper look into The Cosmos:

### My Work 

- [[ ⌨️ The Blog ]] (Currently empty)

### My Notes

- If you wish to take a step into my mind and navigate the depths of The Cosmos, you can do so through my home note [[🫀 The Core]]. 
- For a more in depth explanation of this thinking, learning and writing process, visit  [[☯️ The Flow]]. 
- For a reading list of my favorite sources that have fed The Cosmos, visit [[📚 The Library]].
