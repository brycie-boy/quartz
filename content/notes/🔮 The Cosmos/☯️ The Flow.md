> _“The Way of the sage is work without effort”_

The ultimate goal i had for [[🔮 The Cosmos]] was to create an effecient learning, thinking, and teaching experience that aligns with the principle of [[non-forcing]]. To accomplish this, i developed The Flow. [[🔮 The Cosmos]] consists of a collection of notes which are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time across projects. This allows me [[focus on systems instead of goals]]. This is an unsual way to think about writing notes: [[Most people take only transient notes]]. The Flow is diametrically apposed to this—this practice is not about just writing notes, it is about effectively developing insight: [[Better note taking misses the point; what matters is better thinking]]. 

The Flow has 3 main stages:

1. [[Ingestion]]
2. [[Digestion]]
3. [[Egestion]]
