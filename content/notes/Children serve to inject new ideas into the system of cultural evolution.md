## Children serve to inject new ideas into the system of cultural evolution  # 

Because [[the evolution of the human brain lead to our brains being immature at birth]], we have the longest childhood of any species and [[much of the growth of the human brain occurs after birth]]. This extended period of learning and exploration is what‚Äôs distinctive about us. Childhood is, as Dr. [[Alison Gopnik]] put it, the research and development stage of the species, concerned exclusively with learning and exploring. We adults are production and marketing.

Each generation of children confronts a new unique environment, and their [[brain]]s are particularly good at learning and thriving in that environment. Think of the children of immigrants, or four-year-olds confronted with an iPhone. Children don‚Äôt invent these new tools, they don‚Äôt create the new environment, but in every generation they build the kind of [[brain]] that can best thrive in it. Also, [[Children, babies, and animals act independently without caring what others will think]]. Childhood is the species‚Äô way of injecting noise into the system of cultural evolution.

The child‚Äôs [[brain]] is extremely plastic, good for learning, not accomplishing‚Äîbetter for exploring rather than exploiting. It also has a great many more neural connections than the adult [[brain]]. But [[the brain selects for the brain circuits that are most utilized throughout development]]. A key element of that developmental process is the suppression of [[high-entropy state]]s, with all of its implications, both good and bad. The system cools, and [[high-temperature search]]es become the exception rather than the rule. The [[default mode network]] and [[left hemisphere]] come online, and [[the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]. Perhaps this explains why [[public schools serve to manufacture a manageable population and to put down dissent and originality]].
