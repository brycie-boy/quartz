## Chronic cortisol exposer reduces cortisol receptors in the amygdala and weakens the prefronal cortex #🧠 

The more [[cortisol]] the [[amygdala]] is exposed to, the fewer [[cortisol]] [[receptor]]s in the [[amygdala]] and the more likelihood that your [[amygdala]] will do the talking from here on. Also, [[the frontal cortex is equally vulnerable to shrinkage from cortisol as the hippocampus]]. Chronic stress day by day weakens your [[prefrontal cortex]] to the point where the [[amygdala]] becomes the new head of the [[brain]] and then you just react to the slightest provocation without any thought of the consequences.
