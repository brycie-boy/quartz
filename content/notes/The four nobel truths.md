## The four nobel truths  #‚è≥ 

The four noble truths are four factors that are said to be penetrated upon awakening. These are:

- The truth of unsatisfactoriness: which involves [[the five aggregates]]
- The truth of the origin of dissatisfaction: which is [[craving]] 
- The truth of the cessation of dissatisfaction: which is [[Nibbana]]
- The truth of the way leading to the cessation of dissatisfaction: which is [[the Nobel Eightfold Path]]
