Neurons are the basic building blocks of the [[nervous system]]; their main function is to communicate with each other across tiny junctions called [[synapse]]s. While there are many sorts of neurons, their basic design is pretty similar. Each neuron has a [[soma]] that makes proteins so the neuron can stay alive. The [[soma]] sends out spikes called [[dendrite]]s which receive [[neurotransmitter]]s from other neurons and allow them to communicate with each other. Each neuron also has one long [[axon]], a special fiber that transmits this information. When a neural impulse is generated in the first [[cell]], it pulses down to the end of the [[axon]], which contains little packets of [[neurotransmitter]]s waiting to be released. The firing [[axon]] then shoots the [[neurotransmitter]]s across the [[synapse]] to bind to the [[receptor]]s on the [[dendrite]]s of the next [[cell]] either inhibiting it or exciting it to fire.
