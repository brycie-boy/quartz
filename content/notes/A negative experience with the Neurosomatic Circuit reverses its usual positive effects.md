## A negative experience with the Neurosomatic Circuit reverses its usual positive effects   # 

Negative [[Neurosomatic Circuit]] effects are experienced by amateur yogis, by many pot-heads and psychonauts, and by a large number of schizophrenics. The neurosomatic feedback loop, in these unfortunate cases, reverses the usual positive effects. Sensory experience becomes unpleasant (any sound or touch is painful), sensuality turns into acute discomfort with the entire body, perceptions warp into nightmare, and general anxiety is [[imprint]]ed. Light is particularly terrifying and painful, often associated with Hell or with "mind-control‚Äù manipulated by unscrupulous enemies. Many shamans and mystics have been through similar negative-to-positive neurosomatic sensitization. Christian Scientists call it ‚Äúchemicalization. ‚Äù St. John of the Cross called it, poetically, the Dark Night of the Soul. Cabalists call it ‚Äúcrossing the Abyss.‚Äù Psychonauts call it a "bad trip". Pot-heads experience it as the notorious paranoia some experience with a [[Cannabis]] high.
