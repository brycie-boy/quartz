## Diabetes  # 

Diabetes is a group of common [[endocrine]] disease characterized by sustained high [[blood glucose]] levels. There are two kinds of diabetes: type 1 is due to [[insulin]] deficiency (an autoimmune destruction of the [[pancreas]]) and is usually associated with children (although some adults can get it); type 2 is due to [[insulin resistance]], the key driver of [[metabolic syndrome]] and usually associated with adults (although some children can get it).
