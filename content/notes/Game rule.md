## Game rule  #‚è≥

Game rules refer to the rules of a system that one must follow in order to participate in that system. The proposition "The Pope is infallible in matters of faith and morals" may be considered to be a [[meaningless statement]] by some, and by others, it may be considered a badly formulated [[self-referential statement]]. But it may be best to consider this proposition a Game Rule. That is, it is a rule which one must except if they are to play the Roman Catholic game, and if they were to reject it, they would be automatically excluded from the Roman Catholic game. Similarly, "the umpire's decision is binding" is a rule of the game of baseball and "you may not eat pork" is a rule of the game of Orthodox Judaism. 

Therefor the proposition "All human beings are created equal" may be considered a Game Rule of liberal democracy. Certainly, this is not a scientific statement, because some humans are measureably taller, have measurably higher IQs, etc. And to describe "All human beings are created equal" as a [[self-referential statement]] misses the point, since it is not a paraphrase of "I wish to treat all human beings as equal." it is a proposal of what type of society some people may wish to have. Therefor, it should be considered a Game Rule of that society, precisely like the Pope's "infallbility" is a Game Rule of Roman Catholicism.
