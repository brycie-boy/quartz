## Cognitive dissonance  #⏳

Cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort experienced when one confronts information which is at variance with their personal [[reality tunnel]]. According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent. The discomfort is triggered by the person's [[reality tunnel]] clashing with new information perceived, wherein the individual tries to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.
