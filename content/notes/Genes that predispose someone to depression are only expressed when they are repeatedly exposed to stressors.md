## Genes that predispose someone to depression are only expressed when they are repeatedly exposed to stressors # 

If you have “the [[gene]]” (or [[gene]]s) “for” [[depression]], then is [[depression]] inevitable? Obviously not, and the best evidence for this is to consider identical twins. One has [[depression]] and the other, sharing all the same [[gene]]s, has about a 50 percent chance of having the disease as well, a much higher rate than in the general population. There, pretty solid evidence for [[gene]]s being involved. But flip this the other way. Share every single [[gene]] with someone who is [[Depression|depressive]] and you still have a 50 percent chance of not having the disease.

This is because [[Gene expression is highly contingent on the environment]]. [[Those undergoing significant stress are more likely to develop depression]], and [[gene]]s increase the risk of [[depression]], but only in certain environments: you guessed it, only in _stressful_ environments. This is shown in a number of ways, but most dramatically in a study by [[Avshalom Caspi]] at King’s College, London. Scientists identified a certain [[gene]] in humans that increases the risk of [[depression]]. More specifically, it is a [[gene]] that comes in a few different “allelic versions”—a few different types or flavors that differ slightly in function; have one of those versions, and you’re at increased risk. 

So having version X of this [[gene]] Z doesn’t guarantee you develop [[depression]], it just increases your risk. And, in fact, knowing nothing more about someone than which version of [[gene]] Z someone has doesn’t increase your odds of predicting whether they gets [[Depression|depressed]]. Version X increases [[depression]] risk only when coupled with a history of repeated major [[stressor]]s. Amazingly, the same has been shown with studies of some nonhuman primate species, who carry a close equivalent of that [[gene]] Z. It’s not the [[gene]] that causes it. It’s that the [[gene]] interacts with a certain environment. More specifically, a [[gene]] that makes you vulnerable in a stressful environment. But [[genetic theories of medical or mental conditions can enable people or society to absolve themselves from responsibility]], thus if the enviroment really is stressful, such theories get those responsible off the hook.
