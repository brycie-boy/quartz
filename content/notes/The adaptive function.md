## The adaptive function  # 

The adaptive function is the first of [[Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school]]. It states that schools are to establish fixed [[habit]]s of reaction to authority. This, of course, precludes critical judgment completely. It also pretty much destroys the idea that useful or interesting material should be taught, because you can‚Äôt test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn, and do, foolish and boring things. Methods used by schools for enforce the adaptive fuction include: 

- [[The use positive and negative reinforcement in schools condition students for emotional dependence on authority]]
- [[Schools encourage intellectual dependency towards authority by discouraging inquiry]]
- [[The numbering, grading, and ordering of students conditions them to tacitly accept their hierachical position]]
- [[School grades teach students to believe that their self-worth depends on expert opinion]]
