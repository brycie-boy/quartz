[[In-group and out-group|Us/Them-ing]] typically involves inflating the merits of [[In-group and out-group|in-group]]s concerning core values‚Äîwe are more correct, wise, moral, and worthy when it comes to knowing what the gods want/running the economy/raising kids/fighting this war. Us-ness also involves inflating the merits of our arbitrary markers, and that can take some work‚Äîrationalizing why our food is tastier, our music more moving, our language more logical or poetic.
