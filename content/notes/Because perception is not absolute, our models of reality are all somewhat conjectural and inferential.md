## Because perception is not absolute, our models of reality are all somewhat conjectural and inferential #üß† 

On the face of it, once we acknowledge that [[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]], there seems to be no escape from an at least partial [[Model Agnosticism]] and a recognition that all ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferitial. If perception is not absolute, then no deduction from perception can be absolute. No matter how ingeniously one juggles with approximations, they do not magically become certainties; at best, they only become the most accurate approximations.

[[Aristotle]] escaped this conclusion, and until recently, most philosophers and scientists have followed. They've done so by asserting or assuming or _hoping_ that some method exists whereby the uncertanty of perception can be transended and we can arrive at certitude about general principles.
