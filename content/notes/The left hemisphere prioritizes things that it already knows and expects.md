## The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects # 

Since [[novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar]], then only the [[right hemisphere]] can bring us something other than what we already know. But the [[left hemisphere]] deals with what it knows, and therefore prioritizes the expected‚Äîits process is predictive, and is responsible for [[predictive coding]]. It positively prefers what it knows. This makes it more efficient in routine situations where things are predictable, but less efficient than the right wherever the initial assumptions have to be revised, or when there is a need to distinguish old information from new material that may be consistent with it. Because the [[left hemisphere]] is drawn by its expectations, the [[right hemisphere]] outperforms the left whenever prediction is difficult.
