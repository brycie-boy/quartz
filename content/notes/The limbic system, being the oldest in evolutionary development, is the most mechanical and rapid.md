## The limbic system, being the oldest in evolutionary development, is the most mechanical and rapid  # 

The [[limbic system]], being the oldest in evolutionary development, is the most mechanical, and the most rapid. the [[limbic system]] is not conscious of time at all. First, [[the limbic system is programmed to seek a cormfort-safety zone around a mothering organism]], and then with age moves further and further out, exploring what is safe and what is not. 

The [[nucleus]] accumbens is also a ‚Äúlearning‚Äù pathway‚Äîlearning what feels good.

Without hard-wired genetic programs (automatic programs) this second stage would be impossible, and no mammal would ever leave the teat. The hard-wired programs act automatically (UNCONSCIOUSLY) because if you had to stop and think out each situation, you would be eaten by the first predator.

Of course, the imprint is made by chance‚Äîby the circumstances at the moment of [[imprint]] vulnerability. Some [[imprint]] bravery, inquisitiveness and the exploratory drive; others [[imprint]] timidity, infophobia (fear of the unpredictable), and [[addiction]]. All of which is robotic, until one learns how to reprogram and re[[imprint]] one‚Äôs own [[brain]] circuits.
