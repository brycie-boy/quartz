## Main sequence notes should be densely linked #⏳ 

If we push our selves to add lots of links between our notes, it makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we are thinking about. It creates pressure to think carefully about what ideas might relate to each other. Therefor we should strive to make our [[☀️ Main-Sequence Note]]s densely linked. This is a solution to the fact that [[public schooling fosters confusion through a fragmented and out of context material]]. Also, [[the left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context]], where as [[the right hemisphere sees things in their context]]. This strategy can help us avoid narrow [[left hemisphere]] thinking take a more wholistic [[right hemisphere]] approach to learning. It also exercises [[right hemisphere]] flexibility since [[the right hemisphere can link together distantly related words and ideas]].
