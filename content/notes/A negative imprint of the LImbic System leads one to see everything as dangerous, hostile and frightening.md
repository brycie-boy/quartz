[[A stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life]]. If this initial [[Imprint]] of the [[limbic system]] is negative—if the universe in general and other humans in particular are [[imprint]]ed as dangerous, hostile and frightening, [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves|the Prover]] will go on throughout life adjusting all perceptions to fit this map. This is what is known as “Injustice Collector” syndrome. The female members of this [[imprint]] group become Radical Feminists; the male members are less organized and can be found in fringe groups of the far Left and far Right.
