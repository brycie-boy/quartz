## Conformity is influenced by amount of contradictors # 

With groups, issues of numbers come into play with [[conformity]]‚Äîhow many other voices are urging you to join the cool kids? Among chimps or two-year-old humans, one individual doing something three times does not evoke the conformity of three individuals doing the same act once each. Echoing this, follow-up studies by Asch showed that [[conformity]] first kicks in when there are at least three people unanimously contradicting what the subject thinks, with maximum [[conformity]] first evoked by around half a dozen contradictors. But this is the artificial world of lab subjects judging the length of a line‚Äîin the real world the conforming power of a lynch mob of six doesn‚Äôt approach that of a mob of a thousand.
