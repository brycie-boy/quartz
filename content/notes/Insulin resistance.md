## Insulin resistance  # 

[[Insulin]] resistance occurs when the [[cell]]s in the muscles, fat, and l[[iver]] no longer respond to the [[insulin]] signal. [[Glucose]] thus can’t get in, and so the [[cell]]s send signals to the [[pancreas]] to crank out even more [[insulin]]. The [[glucose]] builds up in the blood at the same time that the [[cell]]s are starving, adding insult to injury. Insulin resistance is the primary defect in [[metabolic syndrome]].
