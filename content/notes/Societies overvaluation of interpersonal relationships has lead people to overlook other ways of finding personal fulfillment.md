## Societies overvaluation of interpersonal relationships has lead people to overlook other ways of finding personal fulfillment # 

One way we may decide to re-organize the patterns of our life is to take a more permanent step away from the social relations that defined our past, and to focus our energy on cultivating a vocation and a purpose to our life. For while many in the modern world see interpersonal relationships as the primary source of life‚Äôs meaning, our culture may have swung too far in this regard and in the process neglected another important hub around which a meaningful life can be built.  Exclusive concentration upon interpersonal relationships has led to failure to consider other ways of finding personal fulfilment.
