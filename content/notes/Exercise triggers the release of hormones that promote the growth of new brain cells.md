## Exercise triggers the release of hormones that promote the growth of new brain cells  # 

If we‚Äôre going to have [[neuron]]s, we‚Äôll need fertilizer for them, and from the get-go, [[neurogenesis]] researchers have been onto [[BDNF]]. They already knew that without [[BDNF]] our [[brain]]s can‚Äôt take in new information (see [[BDNF is necessary for LTP to be able to occur]]), and now they‚Äôve seen that [[BDNF]] is also a necessary ingredient for making new [[neuron]]s.

[[BDNF]] gathers in reserve pools near the [[synapse]]s and is unleashed when we get our blood pumping. In the process, a number of [[hormone]]s from the body are called into action to help; [[IGF-1]] ([[insulin]]-like growth factor), [[VEGF]] (vascular endothelial growth factor), and [[FGF-2]] (fibroblast growth factor). During exercise, these factors push through the [[blood-brain barrier]]. Scientists have just recently learned that once inside the [[brain]], these factors work with [[BDNF]] to crank up the molecular machinery of learning. They are also produced within the [[brain]] and promote [[stem-cell]] division, especially during exercise. The broader importance is that these factors trace a direct link from the body to the [[brain]].
