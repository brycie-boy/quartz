## The formless attainments  #

The formless attainments are four meditative states that continue the mental unification of [[the jhanas]]. They're distinguished from [[the jhanas]] by there transendance of the object of concentration. These are:

- [[The base of the infinity of space]]
- [[The base of the infinity of consiousness]]
- [[The base of nothingness]]
- [[The base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception]]
