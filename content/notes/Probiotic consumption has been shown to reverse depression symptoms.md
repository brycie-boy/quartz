## Probiotic consumption has been shown to reverse depression symptoms  # 

An animal study in 2017 from the University of Virginia School of Medicine indicated that [[Lactobacillus]], a single gut bacterium commonly found in live cultures in yogurt, can reverse [[depression]] in rats. More recently, similar findings have been established in humans as well. 

In 2010, [[Michael Messaoudi]] and his colleagues studied fifty-five healthy men and women who were randomly assigned to receive either a daily [[probiotic]] formula or a placebo for thirty days. Before and after treatment, the research subjects filled out questionnaires about their mood. They also provided urine samples so that their levels of [[cortisol]] could be checked. Compared to the placebo group, those in the [[probiotic]] group reported less [[depression]], and urinary levels of [[cortisol]] were lower, indicating that their [[brain]]s were less [[Depression|depressed]] and less stressed. Why was this the case? Certain species of [[gut bacteria]] have the ability to boost levels of [[brain]] chemicals such as [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]], which may speed relief from [[depression]] and other mental health conditions
