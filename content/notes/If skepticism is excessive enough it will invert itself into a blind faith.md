## If skepticism is excessive enough it will invert itself into a blind faith  #‚è≥ 

Sort of like a quasi-Newtonian law in psychology whereby every mental action produces an equal and opposite mental reaction. Every [[Idol]], or obsession, if adhered to devoutly enough, gradually turns into its opposite. Skepticism and blind faith often turn into each other if one is logical enough, or mad enough, to pursue them to that point of pure abstract consistency where ordinary common sense is left behind in the rush for certitude. 

It is obvious that every dogmatic faith produces around itself a layer of doubt, denial, and outright skepticism about rival faiths. Every faith, every acceptance, creates necessary doubt or rejection of things outside of that faith. Every [[idol]] is jealous of other [[Idol]]s. Less obviously, the skeptic has their own blind faith, a psychological stocoma that is unconscious and therefor unagknowledged. To deny dogmatically is to say something is impossible. But to assert this is to claim, tacitly, that you know the full range of the possible. 

In this century alone, every decade has brought new and astonishing scientific shocks, it is a huge, brave, and audacious faith indeed. It requires an almost heroic self-confidence and an equally gigantic ignorance of intellectual history. The only escape from this trap is to adopt a [[model agnosticism]].
