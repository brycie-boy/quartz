## Glucagon  # 

Glucagon is a [[hormone]] released by the [[pancreas]] when we have low levels of [[blood glucose]] and [[insulin]], which occurs when [[carbohydrate]] intake is decreased enough. Glucagon interacts with our [[adipose tissue]] or [[fat]] [[cell]]s to release stored [[fat]] into our bloodstream where it can be used by [[cell]]s for energy.
