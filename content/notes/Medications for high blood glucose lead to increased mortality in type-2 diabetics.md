## Medications for high blood glucose lead to increased mortality in type-2 diabetics # 

A fasting [[blood glucose]] level is the common test for [[hyperglycemia]] ordered by your doctor in addition to testing your [[cholesterol]]. This test administered on type 2 [[Diabetes|diabetics]] will reflect high and fluctuating [[glucose]] levels. Another blood test for chronically high [[blood glucose]] levels is the [[diabetes]] biomarker [[hemoglobin A1c]]. If you have type 2 [[diabetes]] and run high [[blood glucose]] levels, you‚Äôre at increased risk for disease in several [[organ]]s, such as [[retinopathy]] ([[eye]]), [[neuropathy]] (peripheral [[neuron]]s), and [[nephropathy]] ([[kidney]]). And when diagnosed, your clinician is likely to prescribe medications such as oral [[hypoglycemic]]s (glucose-lowering agents) and injectable [[insulin]] to lower [[blood glucose]] and [[hemoglobin A1c]].

So why do these medications lead to increased mortality? Initially, it looked like these medicines made things better. There was an initial reduction in amputations in dialysis with intensive [[blood glucose]] control. But the rates of type 2 [[diabetes]] continue to climb, and the potential side effects of these meds, which can include dizziness, drowsiness, heartburn, gastrointestinal distress, and seizures, continue to accrue. In fact, the side effects of [[glucose]]-lowering meds are responsible for 100,000 ER visits in the US per year. Again, [[modern medicine tends to target the pathology of an illness rather than preventing it]].
