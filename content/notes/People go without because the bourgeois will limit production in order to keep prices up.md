## People go without because the bourgeois will limit production in order to keep prices up  # 

The [[bourgeoisie]] constantly reduces output by restraining production, and the production of the most necessary things is limited. However much workers want to produce and distribute goods freely, the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] will limit production and distribution in order to keep prices up, and thus people go without.
