## Field trails for new diagnostic criteria for mental disorders are unreliable for predicting future rates # 

[[Psychiatrists must run field trials for each new set of diagnostic criteria to prevent unpleasant surprises]]. One problem with this even the best field trial is performed in the present and can’t fully anticipate the future. The carefully done [[DSM]]-IV [[ADHD]] predicted that the proposed changes would cause only a 15 percent increase in rates. This was probably a fairly accurate estimate given the reality when the data were gathered in the early 1990s. They couldn’t foresee the abrupt switch in this reality that occurred in 1997, when drug companies brought new and expensive medicine for [[ADHD]] to market and were simultaneously set free to advertise them directly to parents and teachers. Soon the selling of [[ADHD]] as a diagnosis was ubiquitous in magazines, on your TV screen, and in pediatricians’ offices—an unexpected epidemic was born, and the rates of [[ADHD]] tripled.
