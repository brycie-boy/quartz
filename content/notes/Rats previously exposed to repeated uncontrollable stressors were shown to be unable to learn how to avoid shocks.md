## Rats previously exposed to repeated uncontrollable stressors were shown to be unable to learn how to avoid shocks # 

Why is it that most of us can have occasional terrible experiences, feel depressed, and then recover, while a few of us collapse into major [[depression]]? Certain features dominate as psychologically stressful: a loss of control ([[Lack of control predicts stress-response]]) and of predictability ([[Lack of predictability predicts stress-response]]) within certain contexts, a loss of outlets for frustration, a loss of sources for support ([[Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in primates]] [[Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in humans|including humans]]), a perception of life worsening. 

In one style of experiment, pioneered by the psychologists [[Martin Seligman]] and [[Steven Maier]], animals are exposed to pathological amounts of these psychological [[stressor]]s. The result is a condition strikingly similar to a human [[depression]]. Although the actual [[stressor]]s may differ, the general approach in these studies always emphasizes repeated [[stressor]]s with a complete absence of control on the part of the animal. For example, a rat may be subjected to a long series of frequent, uncontrollable, and unpredictable shocks or noises, with no outlets.

After awhile, something extraordinary happens to that rat. This can be shown with a test. Take a fresh, unstressed rat, and give it something easy to learn. Put it in a room, for example, with the floor divided into two halves. Occasionally, electricity that will cause a mild shock is delivered to one half, and just beforehand, there is a signal indicating which half of the floor is about to be electrified. Your run-of-the-mill rat can learn this ‚Äúactive avoidance task‚Äù easily, and within a short time it readily and calmly shifts the side of the room it sits in according to the signal. Simple. Except for a rat who has recently been exposed to repeated uncontrollable [[stressor]]s. That rat cannot learn the task. It does not learn to cope. On the contrary, it has learned to be helpless. This phenomenon has been dubbed "[[learned helplessness]]." When people believe they have little or no control over their fate, they become anxious. ‚ÄúSomething terrible can happen to me at any time and I will be unable to do anything about it.‚Äù When the anxiety and sense of helplessness become too great, people become [[Depression|depressed]]. ‚ÄúThere is no use trying; I‚Äôm doomed.‚Äù
