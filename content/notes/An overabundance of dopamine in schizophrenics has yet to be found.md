## An overabundance of dopamine in schizophrenics has yet to be found   # 

In 1974, Dr. [[Micheal Bowers]] and his team had measured the level of [[dopamine]] metabolites in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of unmedicated [[schizophrenia|schizophrenics]] and found them to be quite normal. ‚ÄúOur findings,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúdo not furnish neurochemical evidence for an over-arousal in these patients emanating from a [[midbrain]] [[dopamine]] system.‚Äù Others soon reported similar results. In 1975, [[Robert Post]] at the NIMH determined that HVA levels in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of twenty unmedicated [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]s ‚Äúwere not significantly different from controls.‚Äù Autopsy studies also revealed that the [[brain]] tissue of drug-free [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]s did not have abnormal levels of [[dopamine]]. In 1982, UCLA‚Äôs [[John Haracz]] reviewed this body of research and drew the obvious bottom-line conclusion: ‚ÄúThese findings do not support the presence of elevated [[dopamine]] turnover in the [[brain]]s of [unmedicated] [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]s.‚Äù
