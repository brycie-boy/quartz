## Synapse  #🧠 

![[Pasted image 20221108112849.png|200]]

A synapse is a structure within the [[nervous system]] that permits a [[neuron]] to pass an electrical or chemical signal to another [[neuron]]. At a synapse, the plasma membrane of the signal-passing neuron (the _presynaptic_ neuron) comes into close apposition with the membrane of the target (_postsynaptic_) cell. Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic sites contain extensive arrays of molecular machinery that link the two membranes together and carry out the signaling process. In many synapses, the presynaptic part is located on an [[axon]] and the postsynaptic part is located on a [[dendrite]] or [[soma]].
