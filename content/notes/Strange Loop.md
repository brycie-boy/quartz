## Strange Loop  #‚è≥

A¬†strange loop is a¬†cyclic¬†structure that goes through several levels in a¬†hierarchical¬†system. It arises when, by moving only upwards or downwards through the system, one finds oneself back where they started.

For exampl, the proposition "The following sentence is false" can hardly be considered true or false in itself, and we have to judge its truth or falsidity in its context. Fortunetly the context is specified in the proposition "The previous sentence was true." In this case, the context seems to confuse us instead of enlighten us. The first sentence is true if false, and false if true. Such statements is a Strange Loops. The classic Strange Loop, of course, is the notorious Cretan who informs us that all Cretans lie. A more modern instance is the barber who shaves every man in town who  does not shave himself. If the proposition "The following sentence is false" is true, then it is false. If the egregious Cretan is telling the truth, he is lying. If a barber shaves himself, he does not shave himself. 

Such Strange Loops aren't merely philosophical comedy or games by which logicians annoy each other. A great deal of personal and social issues seem to be a result of people accepting Strange Loops into their thinking. A great number of "mental illness" seems to result from the Strange Loop: A. i must adhere to my parent's [[Game rule]]s. B. i must adhere to my society's [[Game rule]]s. When parental and social [[Game rule]]s differ greatly, some degree of "mental illness" is almost inevitable. In logic, there is no escape from a Strange Loop. In ordinary life, there is an easy escape‚Äîreject one part of the system. [[Sombunall]] can be very helpful here. The disrubed patient may begin to recover, for instance, when this Strange Loop is modified to: A. I must obey [[sombunall]] of my parents [[Game rule]]s. B. I must obey [[sombunall]] of my society's [[Game rule]]s. 

The proposition "The Nazis killed 6,000,000 Jews" presents us with even more disturbing problems, because it is believed by almost everybody and rejected by a vehement minority called Holocaust Revisionists. The case for Holocaust Revisionism is that there is a Vast Worldwide Conspiracy that has faked all the evidence which the rest of us naively except. Holocaust Revisionism can hardly be called "false" in a historical sense because it is not part of the history game; it rejects the [[Game rule]]s which historians play by. This can be seen by the idea that Richard NIxon never existed and that all evidence of his existence was faked by another Vast Worldwide Conspiracy. One cannot prove or disprove either of these statements because all historical evidence contrary to the arguement has been deemed tainted. 

It is safe to regard Holocaust Revisionism as another Strange Loop. By assuming that all inconvenient evidence is faked, one opens up an [[Infinite Regress]]; and one can logically ask next if the evidence provided by Holocaust Revisionists has also been faked. A Strange Loop only appears when the charge of fake involves a conspiracy of such size that all evidence becomes suspect since a conspiracy of that magnitude can in principle deceive us about anything.
