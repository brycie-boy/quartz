## HIgher levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine means less tryptophan and serotonin and more dopamine  # 

[[Tryptophan]] is only one type of [[amino acid]] that needs to make it into the brain. These building blocks hop on [[amino acid transporter]]s to cross over the [[blood-brain barrier]]. The problem is, the transporters are sometimes difficult to come by. [[Tryptophan]] is in competition with at least two other [[amino acid]]s, [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]], which are the building blocks for [[dopamine]]. The more building blocks for [[dopamine]]. the fewer that are available for [[tryptophan]] to head to the brain and thus less contentment for the evening. This competitive mechanism of [[tryptophan]] transport into the [[brain]] is but one way by which reward trumps contentment.
