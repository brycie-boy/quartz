so why this is really important and why this is critical to the way i run my vault here is over time i can see the emerging structure of my content my vault my notes my second brain i can over time see the emerging structure

7:43

what that means is that i'm not going to say these are the topics i speak about it's learning it's adhd it's programming those are not the topics that i say i need to list things these are the topics i talk about so any new note i create needs to fall within one of my predefined categories or else i don't know where it goes

8:16

that my actual notes are not set up in a structured folder hierarchy there is no hierarchy it's all just a top level pool of notes so how do you organize and deal with that well as your notes and your vault reach critical mass too many notes to really manage and easily find what you're looking for yes we have search yes we have tags depending on how you use them but as you reach critical mass you're going to start needing some level of structure not necessarily like nested folders to the nth degree where all of your notes must fall that sort of management of your vault becomes to the point where it's in uh too much of an encumbrance it's too much friction for you to create and get notes made and connected when you're constantly just trying to sort and file them in the correct location based on the taxonomy that you set for yourself

9:13

so as a as you go about this and you tag these notes that don't exist so if i go back you know i'm tagging i might tag learning here or flow state or neurology whatever they don't exist yet but when i start to see that a lot of things are connected to them i might say that is a piece of material that is a topic a subject i really need to pay attention to promote to a mock and start connecting to my web of maps of content

these files don't exist on the graph you can see there are different color nodes red nodes that is because these files do not exist in the vault yet they are referenced i'm referencing a node named flow state but the note does not exist if i hover over it you see does not is not created yet does not exist

5:37

why do i do this so over time as i have a large swath of notes in my vault if i over time reference something very often and link it quote unquote link tag it with a specific tag

5:53

what is that that's learning so i might see over time i'm linking to the quote unquote tag learning quite a lot maybe that's a very prominent topic in my vault if i talk about it a lot and i have a lot of notes linked to learning i might want to create that note and then promote it to a mock a map of content saying hey this is a topic i talk about a lot so now i'm not going to list out itemized every single note that's attached to this thing but i might identify prominent areas of subject matter around learning
