One effect of early maternal deprivation appears to be a decrease in the production of [[oxytocin]], one of our love [[neurotransmitter]]s. It is critical to our experience of loving [[attachment]]s and even to maintaining committed relationships. People who have difficulty forming intimate relationships are at risk for [[addiction]]; they may turn to drugs as social lubricants.
