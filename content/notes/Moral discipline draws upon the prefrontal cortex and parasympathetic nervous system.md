## Moral discipline draws upon the prefrontal cortex and parasympathetic nervous system # 

Moral Discipline in [[The Nobel Eightfold Path]] involves regulating your actions, words, and thoughts to create benefits rather than harms for yourself and others. In your [[brain]], this draws on top-down direction from the [[prefrontal cortex]]. Moral Discipline also relies on bottom-up calming from the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] and positive emotions from the [[Limbic system]]. Moral Discipline relies heavily on regulation, both to excite positive inclinations and to inhibit negative ones.
