## Brain scans show that those who defy the groups opinion will try to revise their memories while the brain tries to convince them otherwise # 

[[People have been shown to change their answer to a question if the group disagrees]]. Back to the contrast between conforming taking the form of ‚ÄúYou know what, if everyone says they saw B, I guess I did too; whatever‚Äù and its taking the form of ‚ÄúNow that I think about it, I didn‚Äôt actually see A; I think I saw B; in fact I‚Äôm certain of it.‚Äù The latter is associated with activation of the [[hippocampus]], the [[brain]] region central to learning and memory‚Äîthe revisionism involves you literally revising your memory.

Remarkably, in another study this process of [[Conformity|conforming]] was also associated with activation of the [[occipital cortex]], the brain region that does the primary processing of vision‚Äîyou can almost hear the frontal and [[Limbic system|limbic]] parts of the brain trying to convince the [[occipital cortex]] that it saw something different from what it actually saw. 

Thus the neurobiology of conforming consists of a first wave of anxiety where we equate differentness with wrongness, followed by the cognitive work needed to change our opinion. These findings obviously come from an artificial world of psych experiments. Thus they‚Äôre only a faint whisper of what occurs when it‚Äôs you against the rest of the jury, when it‚Äôs you being urged to join the lynch mob, when it‚Äôs you choosing between conforming and being deeply lonely.
