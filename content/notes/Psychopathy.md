## Psychopathy  # 

Psychopathy is a [[personality disorder]] characterized by: 

- boldness
- superficial charm
- inclination to manipulate
- lack of empathy and remorse
- self-absorption
- impulsivity

Neurologically, it has been linked primarily impairments in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]], as well as reduced connections between the [[amygdala]] and the right [[orbitofrontal cortex]]. Note that [[the strength of the connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex determines a person’s level of emotional reactivity]].
