## The emotions associated with immoral conduct can be distracting during meditation  # 

It Buddhism, training usually begins with generosity, then it moves to virtuous conduct, and then, only after those had been practiced did one advance to meditation. Why? Because If you go around all day acting like a jerk, it will be hard to sit down and meditate. As soon as we try to focus on an object, everything that was emotionally charged from the day will barge into our minds, making it impossible to concentrate. If we come to the cushion not having lied, cheated, or stolen, there is less garbage to take out so to speak.
