The cock-eyed room was an illusory room designed by [[Dr. Albert Ames]] and was designed to demonstrate how [[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]]. The brain, using its habitual programs of [[perception]], will interpret it as just an ordinary room. The room, however, is far from ordinary: it has walls and a ceiling and a floor designed at odd angles which optically trigger in educated individuals the same perceptual ideas as an "ordinary" room. Some evidence suggests that children under five years of age are not taken by this illusion. If two people walk to opposite sides of this room, the brain "sees" that one person "miraculously" grows taller, while the other person "shrinks" down to a dwarf.
