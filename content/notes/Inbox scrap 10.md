CHAPTER SEVEN

Against that positivism which stops before phenomena, saying "there are only facts,” I should say; no, it is precisely facts that do not exist, only interpretations. Nietzsche, The Will to Power

Highlight(pink) - Page 213 · Location 4458

Since the publication of Packard's The Hidden Persuaders, McLuhan's The Mechanical Bride, and similar books, it has been realized that techniques of inducing "mass hallucination" or something like "mass hallucination" are well known to advertisers.

Highlight(pink) - Page 213 · Location 4462

Almost all cigarette smokers, for instance, have a favorite brand and insist that they cannot be satisfied by any other brand. When blindfolded, however, they cannot distinguish this favorite brand from any other brand. They are not buying the cigarettes but buying the package. The same is true of most beer drinkers: they have a favorite brand, but cannot distinguish it from other brands when blindfolded.

Highlight(pink) - Page 213 · Location 4465

This species of "mass hallucination" has been created by conditioning and association. Each advertiser tries to associate his product with something most domesticated primates desire, such as Sex or Status. The commercials carry the association, sometimes fairly blatantly, sometimes subliminally.

Highlight(pink) - Page 213 · Location 4468

The repetition of the association gradually produces the conditioned response. The victim is not exactly "buying the package" as we just said but buying the hope for Sex and Status.

Highlight(pink) - Page 213 · Location 4470

Of course, the satisfaction of the smoker or drinker is just as "real," within that conditioned reality-tunnel, as the meanings of a Rembrandt are within the traditional Western Art tunnel, or the meanings of a Van Gogh within the Impressionist tunnel, or the meanings of an African mask within that tribal tunnel, or the meanings of a Picasso within the Modernist tunnel, etc. All are equally unreal, also (or equally meaningless, to say it otherwise) to those who haven't learned or conditioned themselves to enter these tunnels.

Highlight(pink) - Page 214 · Location 4474

Existential or emic "reality"—the reality of daily life—the "reality" of experience, sensory-sensual "reality," as distinguished from the assumed "real" "reality" of various philosophers—appears then to be too interactive and synergetic to reduce to Aristotelian either/ or choices. It fits more adequately into Buddhist logic: It is real. It is not real. It is both real and unreal. It is neither real nor unreal. Just like the smoker's satisfaction.

Highlight(pink) - Page 214 · Location 4479

Is it only a coincidence that with modern technology we find also that "experimental reality" on the sub-atomic (quantum) level—and the "reality" of specially-designed experience, sensory-sensual "reality" magnified by instruments—also appears less Aristotelian and more Buddhistic?

Highlight(pink) - Page 214 · Location 4483

I have suggested in other books that Einstein's physical relativity is just a special case of a more general neurological relativity: the observer, with or without instruments, always remains co-creator of the observation. To quote Nietzsche again: "We are all greater artists than we realize."

Highlight(pink) - Page 214 · Location 4486

Each nervous system creates a great art-work which it usually considers "the" "real" "reality" in the philosophical sense and projects outward. These reality-tunnels, assumed to be "realities" and experienced as "realities," are not only as varied and imaginative as the paintings of Rembrandt and Van Gogh and Picasso, etc.; they are as marvelously creative as the musics of Vivaldi and Beethoven and Wagner and Harry James and Rock and Indian raga and Polynesian chants; they are as miscellaneous as the novelistic styles or "frames" of Jane Austen and James Joyce and Raymond Chandler and Leo Tolstoy and Lewis Carroll and Samuel Beckett.

Highlight(pink) - Page 214 · Location 4492

And every social reality-tunnel perpetuates itself by basically the same techniques as advertising, of which the chief is repetition. This is maintained half-consciously, by group reinforcement.

Highlight(pink) - Page 214 · Location 4495

The signals (speech units) that maintain the group-reality are repeated endlessly and quite cheerfully, while others are edited out by selection of who gets in.

Highlight(pink) - Page 215 · Location 4497

As Dr. Timothy Leary once remarked, most domesticated primate conversation consists of variations on “I’m still here. Are you still there?" and "Business as usual. Nothing has changed."

Highlight(pink) - Page 215 · Location 4499

For instance, most of us are annoyed frequently by the daily newspaper. "News" or alleged news that we don't want to read gets printed; heathenish and heretical opinions appear on the letters page, and sometimes in the columnists; politicians (of the opposite camp, of course) tell the most outrageous lies, which also get printed.

Highlight(pink) - Page 215 · Location 4501

With modern computer technology, all of this can soon be avoided. Just fill out a simple questionnaire and mail it in. The computer will print a slightly different version of that day's paper for each reader, and your Personalized copy will come to you in the morning containing absolutely nothing but what you want to know.

Highlight(pink) - Page 215 · Location 4503

After a year, or maybe five years, you will have forgotten entirely all the "alien" and uncomfortable signals that once got through to you and caused you distress.

Highlight(pink) - Page 215 · Location 4505

This great breakthrough in computer technology has not yet occurred, but, meanwhile, most people do the best they can, and manage fairly well to edit out what they don't want to know.

Highlight(pink) - Page 215 · Location 4507

When they get together in groups, this is aided by the aforementioned group reinforcement. Everybody tells everybody how reasonable the group-reality is, and how wicked and perverse are all the alien groups with alternative group-realities.

Highlight(pink) - Page 215 · Location 4511

Of course, we all hallucinate frequently—and not just in the sense revealed by the Ames' cockeyed room or similar "tricks"—and not just in "seeing" the moon as bigger than Venus because of the illusions of distance—This happens to everybody occasionally: You are walking down the street. Half a block ahead of you, in the crowd, you "see" a friend. Maybe it's a small surprise (you thought he or she was in another city, or another country) or maybe it's no great surprise at all (he or she lives near this part of town), but in either case you feel happy because it is always good to see a familiar face in a crowd of strangers. You walk closer and the features of the person you "recognized" become clearer. It is not a friend at all. It is a complete stranger. In "seeing" the friend who wasn't there, you selected—at a guess—30% to 50% of the gross features of the figure approaching, and then out of a blur, superimposed or added the remaining 50% or more of the features necessary to create a face you could recognize.

Highlight(pink) - Page 216 · Location 4522

Of course, we do not like to think of ourselves as hallucinators. We prefer the more soothing term, "misperception," for cases like this. Only the mentally "ill" are hallucinating, we think. Still—the difference is only a matter of degree . . .

Highlight(pink) - Page 216 · Location 4536

And I think: Part of what we see seems more-or-less "accurate" perception (￼) and part is projection or misperception or "hallucination" (￼) and part is some mixture of the two (￼)—But only those who are extremely unbalanced mentally see "pure" hallucinations with no source in the sensory-sensual world. So, in considering cases like these, I do not easily believe that the towns of Sunderland and Charleston and Memphis were totally mad and seeing things with no counterpart in actuality.

Highlight(pink) - Page 217 · Location 4542

And I wonder, if we did not, all of us, have strict imprinted and conditioned programs about what is "real" and what is "unreal," would those folks have tuned in something less remarkable than reported, or something even more remarkable?

Highlight(pink) - Page 219 · Location 4586

Colin Wilson, Criminal History of Mankind, op. cit.: Wilson presents a theory of the Violent Male, backed up by criminological and historical data from the past 3000 years, and some current anthropological data on our earlier ancestors. He claims the Violent Male basically acts like Van Vogt's Right Man: he can never admit he might be wrong about anything. His ego definition, as it were, demands that he is always Right, nearly everybody else is always Wrong, and he must "punish" them for their Wrongness. He despises the "softness" of "emotions" and thinks most people are fools. As such, he sounds like the Authoritarian Personality described by such psychologists as Fromm and Adorno; what makes him Violent is a particular savage intensity of what I have called modeltheism. The Right Man, in addition to the above traits, has a basically paranoid attitude toward people: he thinks they are all rotten; they have all cheated him; they are always cheating; they are sneaks; they are liars; they are, in fact, rotten bastards. He is going to be the rottenest bastard of all to get back at them.

Highlight(pink) - Page 219 · Location 4602

The Right Man stays in that Anger Model most of the time, virtually all the time—especially if this becomes an intellectual fad. If he relaxes a bit, it doesn't last long: at the first inconvenience or disappointment, the Anger Model makes sense to him again: everybody is deliberately being nasty and cheating. He will have to punish them again.

Highlight(pink) - Page 219 · Location 4605

Wilson emphasizes that this model describes not only many, many infamous criminals, but quite a few of the more infamous statesmen and churchmen of history, who were not called criminals only because they were powerful enough to define what was "crime" in their society. Since these types have a strong power drive, most of history, as Wilson sees it, is Criminal History, the record of the crimes of one type of male.

Highlight(pink) - Page 220 · Location 4609

This analysis is in remarkable agreement with that of those Feminists who are not Fundamentalists and do not project this model onto all males. Wilson seems to be describing the historical syndrome that they call Patriarchy.

Highlight(pink) - Page 220 · Location 4615

Here we might think again about Dr. Bruner's cat who was able to "edit out" sound at the ear-drum. These processes must be considered, not vaguely "psychological," but concretely neurological. We receive around 10,000 sensory signals per minute and edit out (probably) more than 9,990 of them, to tune in or concentrate attention on less than 10 signals that seem "important" to us.

Highlight(pink) - Page 220 · Location 4618

The other 9,990-plus signals are "unconsciously" classified as "meaningless" or "irrelevant"; they are not "consciously" suppressed because they never reach the "conscious" centers of the brain.

Highlight(pink) - Page 220 · Location 4620

(It is extremely likely that, if the majority of sensory signals did reach the "conscious" centers, we would be so overwhelmed with data that we could not act at all.

Highlight(pink) - Page 220 · Location 4621

It seems plausible to think that the mechanism of psychedelic drugs involves inhibiting inhibitors—turning on circuits that are habitually turned off—and the subject is, then, perceiving, maybe, 20 to 100 signals a minute instead of the usual 10. This itself is startling enough to produce hilarious laughter, profound awe or acute anxiety, especially on first dosage.)

Highlight(pink) - Page 220 · Location 4624

The Right Man, and especially the Violent Man, is then, according to Wilson's theory, simply turning off even more signals than is neurologically normal. Specifically, he has been conditioned or imprinted, or has conditioned himself, to suppress as "irrelevant" or "meaningless" the kind of signals that usually evoke compassion, charity or tolerance, in most of humanity.

Highlight(pink) - Page 221 · Location 4628

In his reality-tunnel, the only signals that reach the cortex are those confirming his thesis that People Are Rotten Bastards who need to be punished.

Highlight(pink) - Page 221 · Location 4629

This mental "set," however appalling socially and historically, is no more "peculiar" neurologically than the mental "set" that allows an artist to see what others ignore while simultaneously ignoring the social Status Game signals that others notice so painfully and acutely, or the "set" which makes certain art works comprehensible (because we have learned to decode their symbolism) while it sees other kinds of art as "meaningless" jumbles.

Highlight(pink) - Page 221 · Location 4646

East-West/ South-North, by Peter Okera, Parade Press, Harrowgate, England, 1983—Mr. Okera, a Black African by birth, was educated as a physicist in England and worked on various UN committees. He tries to identify three types of human cultures. He calls the first Dionysian, and finds it chiefly in Asia and Africa. The second type, Apollonian, is found around the Mediterranean. The third he calls Thorian, and finds dominant in modern Europe and America.

Highlight(pink) - Page 222 · Location 4652

The Dionysian culture produces humans whom Mr. Okera calls inunituals (pronounced in-UNITE-uals): persons who feel themselves united with all around them. The Thorian culture produces individuals (pronounced in-DIVIDE-uals, in a Joycean pun that might be greater than the word): persons who feel themselves separate from all around them. The middle, Apollonian cultures, he says, produce persons who swing between the in-UNITE-ual mode and the in-DIVIDE-ual mode.

Highlight(pink) - Page 222 · Location 4656

Mr. Okera argues that Thorian in-DIVIDE-uals are the most intolerant type of human beings. He says they seem tolerant to themselves, but seen from outside—from an African or Asian perspective—their chief characteristics are dogmatism, robotism, bullying, and violence.

Highlight(pink) - Page 222 · Location 4659

That's only his perspective, of course, but current news seems to indicate that a great many Africans and Asians have that view. It also seems that the cultural type that Mr. Okera calls Thorian is quite a bit like Mr. Van Vogt's Right Man and also like the Male Chauvinist Pig of Feminist polemic. I wonder again if it is only a coincidence that the Citadel is largely made up of economically privileged white males. And I wonder also—

Highlight(pink) - Page 222 · Location 4664

Quite a bit of this book has been devoted to arguing that certain plausible inferences from Bell's Theorem—inferences being considered seriously by many physicists—deserve to be thought about, and are not absurd (even though unfamiliar to our culture) and are not necessarily crazy. And it seems that non-white people have been arguing that—trying to express the in-UNITE-ual perspective, trying to say that in-DIVIDE-ual reality-tunnels are not the only reality-tunnels—for many centuries now, without success. It seems that the Right Man does not hear. He shuts such signals off at the ear-drum.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4669

The territorial marks he has made—his grid for dividing what others see as one whole—is real. It is not inside him, but outside. It is the real grid of the real world. Any other grid is All Wrong.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4672

A social field might be considered a type of energy-field that is highly variable.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4673

People get together and agree to produce a certain field effect called the Jupiter Symphony and it is "meaningful" to them.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4675

Other people, not so consciously, "agree" to perpetuate a certain kind of social game. This game defines social space—how close they stand, who may actually touch another, etc.—depending on the game rules, or definitions of class, caste, hierarchy, etc.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4677

Certain perceptions are reinforced by playing the game, and other perceptions are taboo or "unthinkable." Over generations, this kind of social game becomes a group's reality-tunnel or emic reality or culture.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4679

If there is any validity found in models which consider "consciousness" a social field effect, some games produce in-UNITE-uals who feel connected across space, and other games produce in-DIVIDE-uals, who feel that separation in space is "real" because their game defines it as such.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4682

If consciousness may be considered a non-local field effect, Dionysian or in-UNITE-ual social games will encourage awareness of, and possible use of, these non-local field effects.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4683

Thorian or in-DIVIDE-ual social games will cause a withering of non-local awareness and of non-local field effects. If such field effects occur at all, they will be felt as disturbing and may trigger actual disturbances, including hallucinations and manias.

Highlight(pink) - Page 223 · Location 4688

If "the sum total of all minds is one" (Schrödinger)—if "mind is a metaphor for mind" and we create ourselves, as we create our other grids, by metaphor—if our "minds" merge into, and are aspects of, "group-minds," "group-realities," sociological fields—if these fields are aspects of larger biological fields and genetic programs (as they might be, if the Sheldrake and sociobiological models both have some validity)—if these trans-time evolutionary fields are aspects of nonlocal physical fields of the sort contemplated by quantum mechanics—if hardware is local but software is non-local—Then the in-UNITE-ual perspective—the perspective of most nonwhite societies, and of many artists and most women within white societies—may not be crazy, or perverse, or "mystical," or delusory, or inferior, or "primitive."

Highlight(pink) - Page 224 · Location 4695

The Right Man may merely be a domesticated primate who takes his territorial marks too literally. Maybe.

Highlight(pink) - Page 224 · Location 4699

Maybe, we all begin as modeltheists—incapable of criticizing our own neurological programs. What we see and feel and measure is What Is Real. Our grids and models are experienced out there, not our creations, "objective." Animal behavior indicates that is the evolutionarily "normal" mode of behavior. A dog and a cat do not sit down and ask "What is Real?" They react, automatically and mechanically, to whatever model has been imprinted and conditioned.

Highlight(pink) - Page 224 · Location 4703

Then, maybe, some of us become capable of neurological self-criticism. We actually sit around and ask each other, "What is Real?" And, if we push this habit of criticism and caution, this agnosticism, far enough, we come to—Nietzsche's Chaos and the Abyss.

Highlight(pink) - Page 224 · Location 4705

And maybe, beyond that, we eventually see a Transcendental Unity, a wholeness, an at-one-ness.

Highlight(pink) - Page 224 · Location 4706

I think maybe Mr. Okera goes a bit too far in his glorification of the Dionysian, and much, much too far in his denunciation of the Thorian. There are some in-DIVIDE-ual values that I, as a libertarian, cherish and would not want to see thrown out in a general reversal to in-UNITE-ual modes of thinking/ feeling. Alan Watts, Fritjof Capra and Theodore Roszak, like Mr. Okera, seem to me to often fall into the very error of dualism—mechanical either/ or choices—that they denounce as the major sin of the modern West.

Highlight(pink) - Page 225 · Location 4710

In general, what Peter Okera calls the Dionysian is isomorphic to Joyce's ￼—which includes, in addition to Cain and Satan, such historical figures as Napoleon, Shakespeare, Parnell etc., the Irish in general, the non-white races, and "artistic" and "intuitive" modes of apprehension.

Highlight(pink) - Page 225 · Location 4713

What Okera calls Thorian is similarly isomorphic to Joyce's ￼—which includes, in addition to Abel and the Archangel Michael, such historical figures as Wellington, Sir Francis Bacon, Gladstone, etc., the Anglo-Irish ruling class of Joyce's time, the white race, and "rational" and "political" modes of thinking/ feeling.

Highlight(pink) - Page 225 · Location 4717

These stark contrasts—the ￼ or Dionysian, and the ￼ or Thorian—seem to be virtually identical to the split in the brain between the holistic right hemisphere and the linear-analytical left hemisphere. Dionysian or ￼-type cultures are dominated by the right hemisphere of the brain, and Thorian or ￼-type cultures by the left hemisphere.

Highlight(pink) - Page 225 · Location 4721

Like Joyce, I think that the conflict between these two brain-functions is not likely to be resolved by the triumph of either ￼ or ￼—Dionysian or Thorian—but by the emergence of a unified type including both—Joyce's ￼, which Okera also recognizes as the Apollonian mean.

Highlight(pink) - Page 225 · Location 4725

Maybe just as the West badly needs to integrate the long-repressed Dionysian ( ￼ ) holism, the East badly needs to recognize that tradition of civil liberties for the individual ( ￼ ) that has never appeared in any non-Western culture. Maybe then, as both sides approach Apollonian balance ( ￼ ) neither will perceive the other, any longer, as lop-sided to the point of perversity and madness. Maybe.

The Buddhist says: the mountains are real. The mountains are not real. The mountains are both real and not-real. The mountains are neither real nor not-real. The fruit is orange, to ordinary perception. The fruit is not orange, to Galileo's analysis. The fruit is both orange and not-orange, to those who recognize that the existential and the scientific grids each have a kind of validity. The fruit is neither orange nor not-orange, to those who recognize that all grids are human inventions.

Mysteries, by Colin Wilson, op. cit. p. 198—an experiment on "ESP" by Dr. Gertrude Schmeidler, at Radcliffe College, 1942. As usual, those who believed in ESP scored above chance in guessing hidden cards. We know the materialist objections to this, which is why we mostly haven't bothered citing such research: it was trickery by the subjects or it was sloppy research technique by Dr. Schmeidler. Of course. But in this case—The ones who did not believe in ESP scored significantly below chance. That is, they did not guess as well as any ordinary group would guess. Were they cheating, too? Or are all reality-tunnels maintained in much the same way, by the same unconscious "decisions" to turn synapses off or on to accord with beliefs?

30 December 1985 Brain/ Mind Bulletin (Los Angeles)—a new study by Dr. Persinger, he of the wobbling magnetic and gravitational fields. Persinger took 25 "well-documented" cases of "intense" paranormal experience from the records of University of Virginia researcher Ian Stevenson. These were 25 experiences in which people thought they were having what we call non-local awareness, or what is sometimes called "ESP" or that damned "precognition." Each case involved a relative who was in danger, and the "hunch" or whatever it was, was later confirmed as accurate.

Highlight(pink) - Page 228 · Location 4791

Persinger examined the geomagnetic activity on the days when the 25 eerie events occurred. He discovered that in all 25 cases geomagnetic activity was "less than the mean for the month" and "considerably" less than during the seven days preceding and following. 25 out of 25 is 100 percent.

Highlight(pink) - Page 228 · Location 4795

Or else the non-local fields possibly involved in such happenings are more "open" when not interfered with by heavy geomagnetism?

Highlight(pink) - Page 233 · Location 4915

Of course, if we take the Buddhist metaphor seriously for a few moments, and try to think of a non-dual or non-local existence or a unified continuum—Then any damned Po game makes sense; that is, you can insert a Po between any two allegedly separate things or areas of knowledge and there will be a valid perspective gained.

have these stories, originally, from MEBON—the Mutual Easter Bunny Observation Network. This may well be no more than a parody of the better-known MUFON—the Mutual UFO Network. Martin S. Kottmeyer, the founder of MEBON, explained in a letter to me that the idea behind this remarkable organization came from the writers who have suggested that human expectations create UFO sightings.

Highlight(pink) - Page 234 · Location 4936

Now, there are two schools of thought who both share that opinion, but who otherwise contradict each other totally. For convenience, these may be very loosely called the Reductionists and the Surrealists.

Highlight(pink) - Page 234 · Location 4937

The Reductionists say that human expectations create UFOs by making people hallucinate, and that's all.

Highlight(pink) - Page 234 · Location 4938

The Surrealists say that human expectations really create UFOs, so to speak; phrases that the former group despises—you know, phrases like "psycho-kinesis" and "synchronicity" and "mind-matter interaction"—get tossed around happily by the more exuberant theorists of the group I call Surrealists.

Highlight(pink) - Page 235 · Location 4941

Mr. Kottmeyer and his friends in MEBON decided to check the hypothesis that human expectations might create Easter Bunny sightings.

Highlight(pink) - Page 235 · Location 4942

When they started searching the literature and sending out enquiries, they did not find any unambiguous E.B. sightings, but they did find something a bit fey. They found, in fact, conjunctions of rabbits with UFOs. They have named this new field of study, or this satire on the human love of correlations, lepufology.

Highlight(pink) - Page 235 · Location 4946

We should, of course, decide whether these conjunctions should be interpreted Reductionistically or Surrealistically by unprejudiced examination of the data itself, but if I know anything about human beings, most of us will decide on the basis of whether we are temperamentally Reductionists or temperamentally Surrealists.

One of the researchers who are aiming for physical immortality, mentioned earlier, is Dr. Alvin Silverstein. In his book. The Conquest of Death, he quotes some figures—from French economist Georges Anderla—showing the rate at which scientific knowledge has been increasing in the past two millennia. Anderla's statistics show that knowledge doubled in the 1500 years between the birth of Christ and 1500 A.D. It doubled again in the 250 years between then and 1750, and doubled again in the 150 years between then and 1900. It doubled again by 1950, again by 1960, again by 1968, and again by 1973—at which point Anderla concluded his study. All evidence on the horizon suggests that it has not slowed down but—aided by microprocessors—has probably accelerated even faster since then.

Some rough idea about causality has probably been around since the dawn of human intelligence, but the classic Western metaphor of cause only emerged after Aristotelian logic was combined with experimental method in the late Renaissance. The first doubts about causality began among quantum physicists in the 1920s. Now, since non-local effects violate this model of causality, physicists are becoming accustomed to thinking of two kinds of principles, the causal (local) and the acausal (non-local).

Highlight(pink) - Page 242 · Location 5104

The man and woman in the street knows enough about Relativity to tell you that a rod shrinks as it approaches the speed of light. While this is not quite correct—it contains the Aristotelian assumption that the length at the speeds we are accustomed to it the "real" length—but it is adequate for conversational purposes.

Highlight(pink) - Page 245 · Location 5157

Beethoven's music, I think, is often like that. Just when you think you recognize the pattern in his creative acts, he surprises you by a variation. Is that, maybe, why we sometimes feel such music is closer to experienced reality than any theory we can devise?
