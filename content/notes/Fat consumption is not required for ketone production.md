## Fat consumption is not required for ketone production  # 

Contrary to common belief, the consumption of [[fat]] is not required for [[ketone]] production. This is because there is a difference between the fat that we eat and the fat in our body. [[Ketone]]s are made with stored [[fat]] (with the exception of [[MCT]]s). The [[fat]] that we eat gets absorbed in our digestive tract and packaged into little carriers known as [[chylomicron]]s. [[Chylomicron]]s travel through our bloodstream and are roped in by [[muscle tissue|muscle]] and [[adipose tissue]] where they can then dump off the [[fatty acid]]s they are carrying into [[cell]]s to be used for energy or stored for later use. 

However, [[chylomicron]]s only go to the [[liver]] to be disposed of after they have dumped their [[fatty acid]]s, meaning they are not able to deliver significant amounts of dietary [[fat]] to the [[liver]] for [[ketone]] production. That means that the [[fat]] we eat will preferentially be used for energy by our [[tissue]]s and not for [[ketone]] production. Thus eating more fat will not get your [[ketone]]s higher or that it is necessary to be in a state of ketosis.
