## Mind  #‚è≥ 

Mind, and its objective sphere, phenomena, are the sixth pair of the [[six sense bases]]. What the first five of the [[six sense bases]] signify is obvious enough, but the sixth pair may require some elaboration. The mind base comprises all six types of consciousness arisen from [[sense impression]] and is also the passive flow of [[consciousness]] from which active conceptual [[consciousness]] emerges. All entities not cognized through the other sense bases constitute the phenomena base. The phenomena base then includes the other three mental aggregates‚Äî[[feeling]], [[perception]], and [[volitional formation]]s‚Äîas well as "mental objects" such as those apprehended by introspection, imagination, and reflection.
