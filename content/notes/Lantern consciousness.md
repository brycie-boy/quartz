## Lantern consciousness  # 

Lantern [[consciousness]] is a [[high-entropy state]] that occurs when attention is more widely diffused, allowing one to take in information from virtually anywhere in their field of awareness. It is dependent on the [[right hemisphere]] because [[the right hemisphere has broad, global attention, while the left has narrow attention]]. This is the default state that is experienced by children, as [[babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left]]. While children seldom exhibit sustained periods of [[spotlight consciousness]], adults occasionally experience that “vivid panoramic illumination of the everyday” that lantern [[consciousness]] affords us.

[[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]], and being inexperienced in the way of the world, the mind of the young child has comparatively few priors and preconceptions from which the [[left hemisphere]] can guide their perceptions down the predictable tracks. Instead, the child approaches reality with the astonishment of an adult on [[psychedelic]]s. This may also be the reason why [[children, babies, and animals act independently without caring what others will think]].
