## The right hemisphere is better with dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis # 

It has been suggested that, whereas the [[right hemisphere]] is required for the sustained ‘monitoring of temporal information’ ([[the right hemisphere is responsible for our sense of time as continuous and unified]]), the [[left hemisphere]] is more efficient for detection of brief temporal flow interruptions that are decontextualised. I believe this merely confirms the predilection for abstraction ([[the left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context]]), as well as the lack of capacity for perception of temporal flow ([[the left hemisphere perceives time as a sequential series of fragmented individual moments]]), in the [[left hemisphere]]. The critical point here is that the [[right hemisphere]] has an advantage where there is fluency of motion, or flow over time, but the [[left hemisphere]] an advantage where there is stasis, or focus on a point in time. 

There is also an ambiguity in the idea of permanence. The [[left hemisphere]] seems to accept the permanence of something only if it is static. But things can change—flow—and yet have permanence: think of a river. [[The right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities]], so the [[right hemisphere]] perceives that there is permanence even where there is flow. Hence, when it is damaged, living beings have no permanency—the Capgras phenomenon.
