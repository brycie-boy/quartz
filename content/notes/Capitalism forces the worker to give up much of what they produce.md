## Capitalism forces the worker to give up much of what they produce  # 

As a result of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, the worker cannot find work without accepting to forgo a great part of what they will produce to the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]. They must sell their labour for a meager and uncertain wage. If they do find work, it is on condition of surrendering a quarter of their produce to the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], and another quarter to the government or middlemen. And their tax, levied upon them by the state, the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]], the landlord and the middleman, is always increasing; it rarely leaves them the power to improve their system of culture.

We condem the feudal lord who forced the peasant to work unless they surrendered to them a fourth of what they produce. We call those times barbarous. But if the forms have changed, the realtions have remained the same, and a worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. They cannot find any better conditions where ever they look, because everything has become [[private property]], and they must accept, or die of hunger.

The result of this state of things is that all our production tends in a wrong direction. Enterprise takes no thought for the needs of the community. Because [[capitalist businesses must turn a profit for the owners in order to survive]], its only aim is to increase profits. Hence the constant fluctuations of trade, the periodical industrial crises, each of which throws countless workers on the streets.
