 ## Neuropsychology

Neuropsychology is a branch of psychology concerned with how a person's cognition and behavior are related to the [[brain]] and the rest of the [[nervous system]].

### Neuropsychology Notes

- [[The distance from immediate experience offered by the frontal lobes can allow us to either exploit and use or to be empathetic]]
- [[The left hemisphere filters and represents experience according to its preconfigured system of classification, and the right attends to everything outside of this process without preconceptions]]
- [[The right hemisphere handles alertness, vigilance, sustained attention, and divided attention]]
- [[The left hemisphere handles focussed attention]]
- [[The right hemisphere has broad, global attention, while the left has narrow attention]]
- [[Novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar]]
- [[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]
- [[The right hemisphere allows for flexibility in thought and behavior]]
- [[When solving problems, the left hemisphere tends to rely on a single solution that fits what it already knows]]
- [[The right hemisphere can link together distantly related words and ideas]]

- [[The right frontal lobe has a depressive stance, where as the left shows undue cheerfulness]]
- [[The right hemisphere brings anxious, disturbed depression while the left brings indifferent or apathetic depression]]
- [[The left hemisphere deals with conscious explicit linear reasoning, and the right with implicit unconscious deductive reasoning]]
- [[The right hemisphere plays a large role in deductive reasoning]]
- [[The right hemisphere is concerned with the self as embodied]]
- [[The right hemisphere sees the body as something we live, while the for the left it is devitalized]]
- [[Right hemisphere damage can result in adnormal integration of our drives with a self]]
- [[The right hemisphere cares about the meaning of language, whereas the left cares more about having control of language]]
- [[The right hemisphere can understand broad and implicit meaning, while the left only understands explicit literal meaning]]
- [[Processing ambiguity requires right hemisphere intuition because language is to precise and definite]]
- [[Lantern consciousness]]
- [[Spotlight consciousness]]
- [[A right hemisphere stroke is more disabling than a left in that one loses the ability to socialize and empathize]]
- [[The right hemisphere is responsible for our sense of time as continuous and unified]]
- [[The left hemisphere perceives time as a sequential series of fragmented individual moments]]
- [[The right hemisphere is better with dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis]]
- [[The right hemisphere allows for the sense of spatial depth, whereas the left understands depth categorically, i.e. above, below]]
- [[Right hemisphere deficits result in difficulty with perceiving irregular smoothly curved surfaces]]
- [[The left hemisphere tends to be stubbornly certain, whereas the right acknowledges ambiguity and is always uncertain]]
- [[The left hemisphere of split-brain subjects has been shown to have to come up with random reasons for things the right hemisphere does]]
- [[The left hemisphere will confabulate explanations for things it doesn't know and seems completely convinced of them]]
- [[When guessing a sequence, the left hemisphere will choose a strategy even at the expense of getting things wrong]]
- [[When flashing lights were changed to follow whatever strategy was being used to guess them, the left hemisphere will insist that it had just cracked the sequence]]
- [[The right hemisphere can consider multiple ambiguous possibilities and interpretations, whereas the left hemisphere jumps to premature conclusions]]
- [[The right hemisphere can understand unclear and fleeting images, while the left requires clarity and stillness]]
- [[The narrowness of certainty appeals to the left hemisphere]]
- [[The right hemisphere is more self-aware and realistic, while the left is more grandiose, optimistic, and unrealistic about it's shortcomings]]
- [[The right hemisphere is more realistic but also more pessimistic and favors depression]]
- [[Those with damage to the right hemisphere lack insight into illness or even denial of it]]
- [[Those with right hemisphere legions show a dull unrelenting cheerfulness in the face of incapacity]]
- [[The left hemisphere is prone to over-optimistic denial]]
- [[The right hemispheres tendency for melancholy may be linked to its heightened capacity for empathy]]
- [[Moral values are dependent on right hemisphere intuition and empathy, rather than left hemisphere abstract reasoning]]
- [[Those with impairments in the right frontolimbic regions have trouble with stopping whatever they're currently doing]]
- [[The frontal lobes for each hemisphere only negate the posterior regions rather than resist, enabling something new to arise]]
- [[The right frontal lobes enables one to step back form espousing ‘my’ position, which enables us to empathize and consider the others point of view]]
- [[The left frontal lobe enables one to peacefully detach from the striving towards individual gain]]
- [[The right hemisphere may have more control over the SNS, and the left may have more control over the PNS]]

- [[An organism will feel less stressed if they believe they have control over a situation]]
- [[Predictable information may lower our stress-response while we are experiencing the stressor by letting us know what coping stratagies are best to use]]
- [[Organisms feel less stressed when they can control the rewards they can get than when those rewards are given to them for nothing]]
- [[Organisms feel a loss of control when faced with an novel and unpredictable situation]]
- [[The left hemisphere inhibits the right more than the right inhibits the left]]
- [[Instilling fear is a common marketing strategy because it quites the prefontal cortex and encourages impusivity]]
- [[Stress-related disease among the poor usually has more to do with feeling poor than actually being poor]]
- [[Income inequality is a strong predictor of poor health because it is about being made to feel poor]]
- [[Income inequality does not predict poor health as much in more egalitarian countries]]
- [[There is a steep rise in health from very poor to lower middle class, but it flattens out in the upper SES range]]
- [[Societies with more income equality, both the poor and the wealthy are healthier than their counterparts in a less equal society with the same average income]]
- [[The low social capital that comes with income inequality can lead to more stress and poor health]]
- [[Dramatic income inequality gets rid of the possibility for there to be lots of social capital in a society, leading to more stress and poor health]]
- [[More social capital in a society can improve the health of the society]]
- [[More income inequality means that the wealthy will spend more money on their own private goods, leading to more stress among the public]]
- [[To really address the poor health of the poor, we would have to uproot the stressors involved in low rank rather than give people more money]]
- [[Unlike monkey's, humans who rank low in the hierarchy almost always have a disproportionate share of disease]]
- [[Receiving a reward at an unpredictable time interval creates a stronger stress response than when it is received predictably]]
- [[Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in primates]]
- [[Having social support is shown to lower the stress-response in humans]]
- [[Our brains make us-them distinctions extremely quickly]]
- [[People have an enhanced capacity for empathy towards in-group members]]
- [[Conformity is a deeply ingrained and automatic instinct in humans]]
- [[People have been shown to change their answer to a question if the group disagrees]]
