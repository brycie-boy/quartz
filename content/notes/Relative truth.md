## Relative truth  #‚è≥

Since [[when a system of thought becomes less than totally trivial, an infinite regress of challanges manifest and it becomes increasingly uncertain]], we can never establish absolute truth. However, absolute falsity _can_ be established since a statement in its absolute form is falsified once an single exception to it is found. If we except this view, then "true" and "false" becomes relative to our knowledge at a particular time in history and should be modified to at least "relatively true" or "absolutely false."

For instance, unless we are excessively pedantic, the proposition "Ronald Reagan wrote Hamlet" should be considered absolutely false. If we _are_ being excessively pedantic, then we can rewrite this proposition to "Ronald Reagan wrote the version of Hamlet attributed to Shakespeare," and _then_ it is absolutely false, since we know of many copies of Shakespeare's Hamlet that were in print before Reagan was born. Thus, we avoid the tricky situation that Mr. Reagan wrote his own version of Hamlet in his youth and then went stark staring sane and destroyed it.

The proposition "The infamous Dr. Crippen poisoned his wife," seems relatively true to most of us. It is interesting, however, that we have already passed through three kinds of relative truth. "Water boils at at 100 degrees Celsius" is relatively true to the laws of physics at sea level on this planet. "pq equals qp" is true relative to one kind of algebra (It is not valid in the Hamiltonian algebra used in quantum mechanics.) "The infamous Dr. Crippen poisoned his wife" is relatively true to the rules of evidence in our legal system. Traditionally we say that Dr. Crippen was proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt. This kind of "proof," however, isn't experimental proof of physics or the formal proof in mathematics; it is legal proof. Since scientific proof, mathematical proof, and legal proof all have different rules, they refer to three different kinds of "truth" or three different kinds of demonstration. 

"The infamous Dr. Crippen was convicted of poisoning his wife" seems to be a fourth kind of statement, namely a historical "truth," and is more certain than the "legal truth" that the blighter did poison his wife. The historical "truth" is based on the assumption that we possess accurate historical records, but the statement that Crippen was guilty is based on the assumption that the jury made no mistakes in the case.
