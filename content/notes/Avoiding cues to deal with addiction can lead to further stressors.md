## Avoiding cues to deal with addiction can lead to further stressors  # 

Avoiding cues might help prevent people from being triggered, but didn‚Äôt directly target the core habit loop. For example, staying away from friends who smoke can be helpful. Yet if getting yelled at by the boss triggered someone to smoke, avoiding the boss might lead to other stressors, such as unemployment. This is one reason why traditional methods of behavior change usually fail.
