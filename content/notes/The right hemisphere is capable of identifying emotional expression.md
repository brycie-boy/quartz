## The right hemisphere is capable of identifying emotional expression  # 

It is the [[right hemisphere]] that identifies emotional expression: it is faster and more accurate than the [[left hemisphere]] in discriminating facial expression of emotion. Specifically the right [[superior temporal sulcus]] appears to be involved in recognition of facial emotion. The [[right hemisphere]] is the locus of interpretation, not only of facial expression, but of prosody (vocal intonation) and gesture. The superiority for emotional perception is in addition to, and distinct from, the right [[parietal lobe]]'s known superiority for visuospatial interpretation. Those with [[right hemisphere]] damage have difficulty understanding emotional intonation or implication.
