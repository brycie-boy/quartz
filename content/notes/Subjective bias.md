## Subjective bias  #⏳

Subjective biases are the individual inclinations shaped by [[Imprint]]ing and [[conditioning]]. The more that a particular behavior is repeated, the more we learn to see the world through a [[reality tunnel]] that is biased, based on rewards and punishments from previous actions. We form a [[habit]]ual way of seeing. And it is subjective because it is particular to our own personal tastes. I believe it to involve the [[left hemisphere]], because [[novel experience and information is handled by the right hemisphere, and is handled by the left hemisphere once it becomes familiar]].

Overtime, we get used to wearing a particular set of glasses, adhering to a particular [[reality tunnel]] more and more, and we forget we are wearing them. They become an extension of us—a [[habit]] or even an Objective Truth. Overtime, our [[reality tunnel]] becomes so reflexive that we fail to question our knee jerk assumptions, and as a result, [[we generally struggle to examine and criticize our own beliefs and perceptions]].
