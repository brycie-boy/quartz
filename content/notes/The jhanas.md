## The jhanas  #⏳ 

The jhanas are profound states of concentration in which the mind becomes fully obsorbed in its object. [[The Buddha]] enumerates four jhanas, named simply after their numerical position in the series, each being more refined than its predecessor. These include: 

- [[The first jhana]] 
- [[The second jhana]] 
- [[The third jhana]]
- [[The fourth jhana]]
