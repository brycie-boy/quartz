## The integrating function  # 

The integrating function is one of [[Alexander Inglis six basic functions of school]]. This might well be called “the [[conformity]] function,” because its intention is to make children as alike as possible. People who [[Conformity|conform]] are predictable because [[identifying with a group obscures your true character and makes you predictible]], and this is of great use to those who wish to harness and manipulate a large [[proletariat]] class. Schools implement the integrating function through the process in which [[the numbering, grading, and ordering of students conditions them to tacitly accept their hierachical position]].
