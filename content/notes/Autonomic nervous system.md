## Autonomic nervous system  # 

The autonomic nervous system is a division of the [[peripheral nervous system]]. It is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions, such as the heart rate, digestion, respiratorty rate, pupillary respose, urination, and sexual arousal. The autonomic nervous system is regulated by integrated reflexes through the [[brainstem]] to the [[spinal cord]] and [[organs]]. The [[hypothalamus]], acts as an integrator for autonomic functions, receiving autonomic regulatory input from the [[Limbic system]]. The autonomic nervous system has three branches: the [[sympathetic nervous system]], the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] and the [[enteric nervous system]].
