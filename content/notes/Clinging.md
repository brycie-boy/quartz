## Clinging  #⏳ 

In Buddhism, clinging is defined as a tight attachment or identification with objects of desire through sensuality and [[Ignorance]]. [[The Nikayas]] list four types of clinging: clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of self. The cause and condition for the manifestation of clinging is [[craving]]. Neurologically, clinging involves the [[posterior cingulate cortex]].
