## Merit #⏳ 

Merit is [[wholesome kamma]] capable of yielding favorable results within [[Samsara]]. Merit produces mundane benefits such as a good [[rebirth]], wealth, beauty, and success. It also serves as an enhancing condition for supramundane benefits, that is, for attaining the stages along the path to [[Nibbana]]. Merit is organized into the groups known as "the three bases of merit", which include:

- giving 
- moral disipline through [[the five precepts]]
- meditation on [[the devine abodes]]
