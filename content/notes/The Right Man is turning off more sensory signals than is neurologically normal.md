## The Right Man is turning off more sensory signals than is neurologically normal  # 

If [[Our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]], then [[The Right Man]] may simply be turning off more sensory signals than is neurologically normal. Specifically, they have been [[Imprint]]ed or [[Conditioning|conditioned]], or have [[Conditioning|conditioned]] themselves, to suppress as "meaningless" or "irrelevent" the kind of signals that usually evoke compassion, charity, or tolerance in the ordinary person. In their [[reality tunnel]], the only signals that reach their conscious percpetion are those confirming that people are rotten bastards who need to be punished.
