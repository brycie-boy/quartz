## Gina Perry had criticized Milgram's experiments for fudged results and hiding that many participants had realized the subject was an actor  # 

[[Stanley Milgram had shown that people would continue to shock someone who missed an answer to a question to deadly levels if ordered to by authority]]. His results have has been questioned in three ways, most piercingly by the psychologist [[Gina Perry]]: Milgram seems to have fudged some of his work. Perry has analyzed Milgram‚Äôs unpublished papers and recordings of sessions, finding that teachers refused to shock much more frequently than reported. However, despite the seemingly inflated results, the finding of roughly 60 percent compliance rates has been replicated. Few of the replicating studies were traditional academic ones published in peer-reviewed journals. Instead most have been re-creations for films and television programs. Perhaps most important, as analyzed by Perry, far more teachers than Milgram indicated realized that the learner was an actor and that there were no actual shocks. This problem probably extends to the replications as well.
