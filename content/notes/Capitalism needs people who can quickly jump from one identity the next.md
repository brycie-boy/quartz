## Capitalism needs people who can quickly jump from one identity to the next  # 

[[Capitalism destroys sources of stable identity so that it can market new ones]], and we are constantly being scrambled, deidentified and made to feel isolated, and thus better subjects to be sold new identities and new relations. Consumer [[capitalism]] needs subjects who continually reenact the infantile drama of [[mirror stage]] identifications. These subjects must oscillate quickly between [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] consciousness and idealized [[ego]] formations. Capitalism needs [[schizophrenia]], but it also needs [[ego]]s. The contradiction is resolved through the acceleration of the rhythm of late capitalist visual culture. The more [[capitalism]] wants us to feel scrambled so that we're isolated, automatonized, and susceptible to replacing our own needs with the needs of [[capital]], the more quickly [[capitalism]] needs to sell us an ever-wider array of identities to feel secure and logical within.
