## BDNF  # 

BDNF helps the [[brain]] sprout new [[dendrite]] branches, producing the same structural growth required for learning. BDNF also binds to [[receptor]]s at the [[synapse]], unleashing the flow of ions to increase the voltage and immediately improve the signal strength. Inside the cell, BDNF activates [[gene]]s that call for the production of more BDNF as well as [[serotonin]] and [[protein]]s that build up the [[synapse]]s. Overall, it improves the function of [[neuron]]s, encourages their growth, and strengthens and protects them against the natural process of [[cell]] death.
