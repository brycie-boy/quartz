## A Leftists Neuroscience Reading Guide

- It is crucial for the leftist to understand how the human mind actually works
- mention kropotkins quote about "understanding the passions"
- Esspecially with the campaign to distort our understanding of it in a way that supports capitalism
- There seems to be a massive movement on the left for fighting "mental health stigma" that i believe is severly misguided
- The psychiatric industry is not your friend. They are infuenced by the same drive for profit and power that every other industry is

**Robert Lustig (2017)**

This book is has the best overall outline of limbic system. Lustig does not oversimplify like a lot of neruoscience writers. I must mention though that some old neuroscience myths have lingered their way into this book. This is not necessarily a dig at Lustig, as these ideas are still widespread. For exapmle, the genetic chemical imbalance theories of mental illness, how neurons can't grow back, that addiction is caused by the substance itself, etc. I mention this because understanding the truth of these phenomena are crucial for understanding how capitalism impacts our mental well being. The subsequent books will clear these things up.

Another important aspect of this book esspecially for leftists are the parts about "neuro-marketing" and how big business has hijacked our dopamine pathways for profit (hence the book title). This highlights vague notion of the so-called "addiction market" i've heard only briefly mentioned here and there by leftists. This is even more substantial once you understand the role stress play's driving substance use. Lustig also touches on what i feel to an important point considering how many leftists i've unfortunately seen deny this, and that is the addictive nature of processed food. No, not just psychologically addictive, he shows how it is neurophysiologically addictive.

**Gabor Mate (2010)**

This book critisizes the dominate narrative that drugs themselves are what cause addiction. Mate attributes the drive for subtance abuse fundementally to stress, and shows that when ones enviroment is made less stressful, drug use generally declines.

According to Mate, it is only those who have had an adverse childhood who develop persistent problems with substance abuse. Not just physical abuse, but more subtle things like stressed parents, lack of interaction with parental figures, etc., can increase the chances for subtannce abuse issues later in life dramatically. 

Of course—although he is not explicit—we cannot attribute this to capitalism

Mate goes in depth into the neurodevelopment of addiction

Mate shows how genetics do not determine the propensity for addiction or mental illness and claims that these ideas are used by individuals and society to avoid responsibility.

#### Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America

This book is an indepth investigation into the history of psychiatric medications, and how effective they really are.
