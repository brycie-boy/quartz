## Authority bias  # 

Authority bias is the tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an authority figure and be more influenced by that opinion. An individual is more influenced by the opinion of this authority figure, believing their views to be more credible, and hence place greater emphasis on the authority figure's viewpoint and are more likely to obey them. Sources of authority bias in society include the way in which [[schools encourage intellectual dependency towards authority by discouraging inquiry]].
