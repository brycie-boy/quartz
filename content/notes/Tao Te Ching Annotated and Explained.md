“Unattached action” is my translation for wu wei, the state where we act without attachments to specific outcomes.

2 Water seeps into and dissolves rocks; electricity flows through a block of metal. Thus, the intangible Tao can permeate all things, even if they appear to be solid, without any cracks or openings.

158

3 We can extrapolate from this to understand life. The Tao acts in a wu wei (unattached action) manner and effortlessly achieves the miracle of life. We find inspiration in this and see the possibility to act without attachments and achieve great works without friction or resistance.

The softest things of the world 

Override the hardest things of the world1 

That which has no substance 

Enters into that which has no openings2 

From this I know the benefits of unattached actions3 

The teaching without words4 

The benefits of actions without attachment 

Are rarely matched in the world5

4 The principle of wu wei is very powerful. By focusing on the process instead of the end result, we allow all things to progress naturally and minimize our tendency to meddle. The net effect is that the difficult becomes easy, and we struggle less but accomplish more.

5 “Take the world” in these two lines means achieving one’s goals in the world. Those who do not understand wu wei may expend excessive resources, time, and energy toward achieving their goals, but end up with poor results. This is because they insist on asserting their manipulative influence, which makes everything more complex and therefore difficult to manage. They are so eager to achieve that they trip over themselves.

81

Pursue knowledge, daily gain1 

Pursue Tao, daily loss2 

Loss and more loss 

Until one reaches unattached action3 

With unattached action, there is nothing one cannot do4 

Take the world by constantly applying noninterference 

The one who interferes is not qualified to take the world
