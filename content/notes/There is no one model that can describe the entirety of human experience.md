## There is no one model that can describe the entirety of human experience  # 

No one model is adequate for the description of all human experience, although some models are better for some purposes than others are. For example, Stanley Laurel throws a pie which hits Oliver Hardy in the face. In the physicist's [[reality tunnel]], the best description of what has happened is Newton's F equals ma. In the anthropological [[reality tunnel]], what has happened is a continuation of the Feast of Fools or Saturnalia or the tradition of the royal fool who is immune from the tabu against rebellion in comic form. To some Freudians, the best [[reality tunnel]] is that the Son's rage against the Father is being expressed symbolically. To some Marxists, it is the worker's rage against the boss. Etc. 

Again, In terms of one kind of sociological model, a common event in any large city can be described as follows: A group of people agree to meet at a certain hour on a certain day to make noise. Other people arrange to be there, to listen to the noise. The meeting happens as scheduled, the noise continues for over an hour, and everybody exhibits behavior indicating that the ritual was satisfactory to them. According to another type of sociological model, favored by phenomenologists and ethnomethodologists, we need to know that the noise was called Symphony No. 9 in D by Beethoven before we can begin to understand what has happened, which is that in the [[Emic Reality]] of these people something has occurred which contains meaning, beauty, grandeur and affirmation of life.
