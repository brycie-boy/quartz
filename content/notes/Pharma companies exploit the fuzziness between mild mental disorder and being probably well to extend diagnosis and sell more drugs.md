## Pharma companies exploit the fuzziness between mild mental disorder and being probably well to extend diagnosis and sell more drugs # 

At the extremes, the distinction between the completely well and the clearly sick is perfectly plain and not the least bit amenable to fudging. In contrast, the much fuzzier distinction between the mildly ill and the probably well is easily and frequently manipulated, as [[the threshold for diagnosing mental disorders are somewhat arbitrary and can be adjusted]]. Most normal people have at least occasional mild and transitory symptoms (e.g., sadness, anxiety, sleeplessness, sexual dysfunction, substance use) that can easily be misconstrued as full fledged [[mental disorder]].

I also believe this to come from a [[left hemisphere]] perspective towards emotional expression, because [[the left hemisphere generally remains emotionally neutral]]. There seems to be an increasing incapacity in psychiatry to understand or tolerate emotional expression. Or at least a desire to put it all into some abstract framework [[The left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context]]. As ever more subtle expressions of emotion are medicalized, it seems that what constitutes mental well-being is moving ever further towards basically being emotionally dead. This perhaps may have to do with sciences objective, detached outlook on the world. 

The business model of the pharmaceutical industry benefits from extending the realm of illness‚Äîusing creative marketing to expand the pool of customers by convincing the probably well that they are at least mildly sick. Disease mongering is the fine art of selling psychiatric ills as the most efficient way of peddling very profitable psychiatric pills. Manipulating the market is particularly easy in the United States because we are the only country in the entire world that allows drug companies the freedom to advertise directly to consumers.

Disease mongering cannot occur in a vacuum‚Äîit requires that the drug companies engage the active collaboration of the doctors who write the prescriptions, the patients who ask for them, the researchers who invent the new [[mental disorder]]s ([[Psychiatrists must run field trials for each new set of diagnostic criteria to prevent unpleasant surprises]]), the consumer groups that advocate for more treatment, and the media and Internet that spread the word. A persistent, pervasive, and well-financed ‚Äúdisease awareness‚Äù campaign can create disease where none existed before. And psychiatry is especially vulnerable to manipulation of the normal/disease boundary because it lacks biological tests and relies heavily on subjective judgments that can be easily influenced by clever marketing (see [[psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on subjective judgement rather than empirical tests]]).
