## The American Eugenics Society created booklets to promote eugenics to children in public schools  # 

[[After the 1921 Second International Congress on Eugenics, many prominent eugenicists joined to form a U.S. national eugenics society to promote eugenics to the public]]. In a 137-page booklet called “Tomorrow’s Children,” designed to serve as the society’s “catechism,” schoolchildren and other readers were encouraged to think of the American [[Eugenics]] Society as a “Society for the Control of Social [[Cancer]].” The mentally ill and other defectives were an “insidious disease,” and each time they had children, they created “new cancers in the body politic.” In a modern society, [[cancer]] needed to be treated with a “surgeon’s knife.” At the moment, though, American society was failing to respond to this threat: “Crime and dependency keep on increasing because new defectives are born, just as new [[cancer]] [[cell]]s remorselessly penetrate into sound tissue.” Consider this with the fact that [[the US public schooling system has its roots in Prussia]], the predecessor to Nazi Germany, which was established between 1905 and 1915, directly preceding these events. Furthermore, [[eugenics had spread from America to Nazi Germany when their economy fell after world war I and they couldn't afford to place mentally ill soldiers in asylums]]. Tells you a lot about the trajectory the U.S. was on. Maybe the U.S. wasn't so different from Nazi Germany after all.
