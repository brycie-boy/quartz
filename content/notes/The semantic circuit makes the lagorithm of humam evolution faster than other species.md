## The semantic circuit makes the lagorithm of humam evolution faster than other species  # 

[[In evolution, entropy increases in non-living systems, and negentropy increases in living-systems]], and the human [[Logarithm|logarithmic]] increment accelerates faster than pre-human evolution because through the third, [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|semantic circuit]] and its symbols (words, maps, equations etc.) we are able to pass information (negative entropy: coherence) from generation to generation.
