[[As of 2010, 85 percent of students have depression and anxiety scores higher than the average in the 50s]]. An even more sobering index of decline in young people’s mental health is found in suicide rates. As of 2010, the US suicide rate for children under age fifteen has quadrupled Since 1950, and that for people age fifteen to twenty-four has more than doubled. During this same period, the suicide rate for adults age twenty-five to forty rose only slightly and that for adults over age forty actually declined.
