The Monad is a base or reality which is beyond the world of common experience where none of [[the great elements]] or even [[the formless attainments|the formless realms]] are present. It is beyond all [[duality]], relativity, time and space. The Monad is completely quiescent, without arising, perishing or change. The Monad is to be distinguished from the countless named things that are considered to be its manifestations. It is a source that is acting alone has an indivisible origin. It is often referred to in Buddhist texts as "the unborn, unmade, unbecome, and unconditioned," the existence of which makes possible the deliverance from what is born, made, come to be, and conditioned. Being the source of all, it is also the greater whole from which all the individual elements of the Universe derive.

The Monad is what we might call the "eternal present." All conditioned things come and go, but the present is always. Conditioned things move in and out of this present. We might say the present sits between creation and destruction. One therefor might call the Monad the "creator" in a [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] sense in that it is constantly destroying and creating a new. Creation must not be taken as some isolated event, because the point in which creation ended cannot be discerned. If things are in constant motion, then so is creation.

- But since everything is always moving, the present is at an indeterminate and infinitely small point, which is another element of its infinitude
- align our will with god so to speak
- Follow the flow of nature
- It is also the beginning and end of everything
- all matter that makes up the world will continue to exist but in different forms
- Same matter different forms
- which is what i believe Jesus meant when he said "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."

Being being the totality of things, the Monad is beyond space-time. As Jesus put it in the Gospel of Thomas, "It won't come by looking for it. They won't say, 'Look over here!' or 'Look over there!'," rather, it is "spread out over the earth, and people don't see it." It is the "intelligible¬†sphere, whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere" referred to by [[Alan of Lille]] In his¬†treaty¬†_Maximae theologiae_.

The Monad is both the all and the creator of the all, and being both the substance from which it proceeds and the governing principle, or [[Dhamma]], which orders. Yet the things themselves and the Universe all originate from the Monad. Thus, the Monad creates itself, and is both transcendent as the creator of the Universe and immanent as the created Universe. 

The Monad¬†is not a name for a particular thing, but the underlying natural order of the Universe whose ultimate essence is difficult to circumscribe because it is non-conceptual yet evident in one's experience. It is the reality of life before its descriptions of it, or in other words, it is the muddle we encounter when we confront the world without ideas; the formless void that existed before ‚ÄúGod‚Äù (intellect) started to create a universe (a system) in Genesis, or before the first [[imprint]].

- Infinite potential from which an infinite variety of divisions may be imposed upon

The Monad is not a concept to be grasped intellectually, as [[speculative philosophical questions lead the practitioner away from liberation]]. In all its uses, the Monad is considered to have ineffable qualities that prevent it from being fully understood through [[conceptual understanding]]. Rather, it may be penetrated by [[experiential understanding]], and its and principles can be followed and emulated.

The penetration of the Monad brings the destruction of [[the three unwholesome roots]], culminating in complete purification of mind. Such purification includes the experience of perfect [[happiness]]. The Monad appears in [[the four nobel truths]] as the cessation of dissatisfaction. Being unborn, realization of the Monad also brings irreversible release from [[Samsara]] upon physical death, thus it is often referred to as the "deathless" or "immortality."
