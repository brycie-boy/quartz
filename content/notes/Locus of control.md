## Locus of control  # 

Locus of control is the degree to which people believe that they, as opposed to external forces (beyond their influence), have control over the outcome of events in their lives. A person's "locus" can be either internal (a belief that one can control one's own life) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which the person cannot influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives). The standard measure of sense of control is a questionnaire called the [[Internal-External Locus of Control Scale]].
