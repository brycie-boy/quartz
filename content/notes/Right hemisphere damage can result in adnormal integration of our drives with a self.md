## Right hemisphere damage can result in adnormal integration of our drives with a self  # 

Interestingly, when there is [[right hemisphere]] damage, there appears to be a removal of the normal integration of self with body: the body is reduced to a compendium of drives that are no longer integrated with the personality of the body's ‘owner’. This can result in a morbid and excessive appetite for sex or food, which is out of keeping with the nature of the individual involved.
