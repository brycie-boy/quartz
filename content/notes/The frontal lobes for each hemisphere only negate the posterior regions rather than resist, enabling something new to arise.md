## The frontal lobes for each hemisphere only negate the posterior regions rather than resist, enabling something new to arise # 

There is one intrahemispheric rather than interhemispheric regional difference in the [[brain]]. This involves the relationship of the [[frontal lobe]]s, the most highly evolved and most distinctively human of all regions of the [[brain]], with the processes going on elsewhere in the [[brain]], including the [[posterior cortex]], which they exist to exert control over. The [[frontal lobe]]s achieve what they achieve largely through what is normally described as inhibition of the posterior part of the same hemisphere. It might be better described, however, especially in the case of the [[right hemisphere]], as modulation‚Äîthe inhibitory effect is ‚Äòsignificantly more pronounced‚Äô in the case of the [[left hemisphere]], perhaps in keeping with its less integrated, more black and white, style. 

This relationship between ‚Äòfront‚Äô and ‚Äòback‚Äô is another example of paired ‚Äòopponent processors‚Äô enabling fine modulation of response. By modulation i mean a process that resists, but does not negate. It is best thought of as the imposition of necessary distance, or delay, enabling something new to come forward. In this way it is like the apparently antagonistic relationship of the two hemispheres: it is neither that the products of one hemisphere negate the products of the other, nor that in some bland sense they merely ‚Äòcomplement‚Äô one another. Their incompatibility permits instead, in a dialectical synthesis, something new to arise.

For example: 

- [[The right frontal lobes enables one to step back form espousing ‚Äòmy‚Äô position, which enables us to empathize and consider the others point of view]]
- [[The left frontal lobe enables one to peacefully detach from the striving towards individual gain]]
