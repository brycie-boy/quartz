## The strength of the connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex determines a person‚Äôs level of emotional reactivity  # 

The stronger the [[synapse|synaptic]] connections between the [[amygdala]] and the [[prefrontal cortex]], the less a person will be hijacked by emotional downs and ups of all sorts. This connectivity modulates a person‚Äôs level of emotional reactivity: the stronger the link, the less reactive. Indeed, that relationship is so strong that a person‚Äôs reactivity level can be predicted by the connectivity. Meditation has been shown to strengthen this connection: [[the brains of seasoned meditators have been shown to have stronger connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex]]
