## People with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response  # 

[[Glucocorticoid]] levels are typically abnormal in people who are clinically [[Depression|depressed]]. A relatively infrequent subtype of [[depression]], called ‚Äúatypical [[depression]],‚Äù is dominated by the psychomotor features of the disease‚Äîan incapacitating physical and psychological exhaustion. Just as is the case with chronic fatigue syndrome, atypical [[depression]] is characterized by lower than normal [[glucocorticoid]] levels. However, the far more common feature of [[depression]] is one of an overactive [[stress-response]]‚Äîsomewhat of an overly activated [[sympathetic nervous system]] and, even more dramatically, elevated levels of [[glucocorticoid]]s. This is probably worse for those who have experienced some for of childhood neglect, since [[a stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life]]. This adds to the picture that [[Depression|depressed]] people, sitting on the edge of their beds without the energy to get up, are actually vigilant and aroused, with a [[hormone|hormonal]] profile to match‚Äîbut the battle is inside them.

Research stretching back some forty years has explored why, on a nuts-and-bolts level, [[glucocorticoid]] levels are often elevated in [[depression]]. The elevated levels appear to be due to too much of a stress signal from the [[brain]], rather than the [[adrenal gland]]s just getting some depressive [[glucocorticoid]] hiccup all on their own now and then. Moreover, the excessive secretion of [[glucocorticoid]]s is due to what is called feedback resistance‚Äîin other words, the [[brain]] is less effective than it should be at shutting down [[glucocorticoid]] secretion. Normally, the levels of this [[hormone]] are tightly regulated‚Äîthe [[brain]] senses circulating [[glucocorticoid]] levels, and if they get higher than desired (the ‚Äúdesired‚Äù level shifts depending on whether events are calm or stressful), the [[brain]] stops secreting [[glucocorticoid]]s. Just like the regulation of water in a toilet bowl tank. In [[Depression|depressives]], this feedback regulation fails‚Äîconcentrations of circulating [[glucocorticoid]]s that should shut down the system fail to do so, as the [[brain]] does not sense the feedback signal.
