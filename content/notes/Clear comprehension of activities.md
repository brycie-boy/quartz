## Clear comprehension of activities  #⏳ 

Clear comprehension of activities is an exercise of the [[contemplation of body]]. The exercise involves being [[Mindfulness|mindful]] and aware of whatever actions one is performing. [[The Buddha]] explains this exercise as follows:

> “... a monk is one who acts with clear comprehension when going forward and returning ... when looking ahead and looking away ...  when bending and stretching his limbs ...  ... when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting ... when defecating and urinating ... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.

That is to say, that you should live in the present moment, in the present action. This does not mean that you should not think of the past or the future at all. On the contrary, you think of them in relation to the present moment, the present action, when and where it is relevant.
