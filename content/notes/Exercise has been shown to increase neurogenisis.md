## Exercise has been shown to increase neurogenesis  # 

Gage went back to the [[environmental enrichment]] model to test how [[a newborn neuron must find something to do to survive]]. According to Gage: "just putting a running wheel in a cage had a profound effect on the number of cells that were born. Ironically, with running, the same percentage of cells die as in the control group — it’s just that you have a bigger starting pool. But in order for a cell to survive and integrate, it has to fire its [[axon]].” Exercise promotes [[neurogenesis]], and the stimulation of [[environmental enrichment]] helps those new [[neuron]]s survive.
