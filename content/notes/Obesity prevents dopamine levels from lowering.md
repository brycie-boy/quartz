## Obesity prevents dopamine levels from lowering  # 

Obesity reaks havick on the [[mesolimbic pathway]] in very consitent ways. If your obese, you're already on the right side of the bell-shaped [[dopamine]] curve ([[There must be a balanced amount of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway to prevent lethargy or irritablility]]). The [[hormone]] [[leptin]] normally reduces [[dopamine]] in the [[ventral tegmental area]] and moves you toward the left of the bell shaped curve (I want ice cream—I ate ice cream—yay, ice cream!). But when your [[neuron]]s are [[leptin]] resisitant, as seen in chronic obesity, [[leptin]] doesn't work; it can't extinguish that [[dopamine]] signal, [[dopamine]] stays high, and you're on your second, third, and force pint—hoping for an ever-dwindiling reward.
