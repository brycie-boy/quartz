## Mindfulness training has been shown to be twice as effective as the gold standard smoking addiction treatment and yeilded a fivefold difference in staying quit  # 

Over two years, Dr. [[Judson Brewer]] and his team had screened over 750 people and had randomized just fewer than 100 in their [[mindfulness]] trial. When the final subjects completed the four-month follow-up visits, they took all the data and looked to see how well [[Mindfulness]] training had stacked up against gold standard smoking addiction treatment. The data showed that the participants of the [[Mindfulness]] training group had quit at twice the rate of the Freedom From Smoking group. Additionally, nearly all of the [[Mindfulness]] training participants had stayed quit, while many of those in the other group had lost ground, yeilding a fivefold difference between the two.
