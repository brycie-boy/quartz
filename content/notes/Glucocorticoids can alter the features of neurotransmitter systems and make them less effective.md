## Glucocorticoids can alter the features of neurotransmitter systems and make them less effective # 

The fact that [[people with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response]] is fitting in that the [[hormone]]s can alter features of all three [[neurotransmitter]] systems‚Äîthe amount of [[neurotransmitter]] synthesized, how fast it is broken down, how many [[receptor]]s there are for each [[neurotransmitter]], how well the [[receptor]]s work, and so on. Moreover, stress has been shown to cause many of the same changes as well. Although [[Cortisol spikes are accompanied by increased dopamine levels in the brain]], sustained stress will eventually deplete [[dopamine]] from the [[mesolimbic pathway]], and [[norepinephrine]] from that alerting [[locus ceruleus]] part of the [[brain]]. Moreover, stress alters all sorts of aspects of the synthesis, release, efficacy, and breakdown of [[serotonin]]. It is not clear which of those stress effects are most important, simply because it is not clear which [[neurotransmitter]] or [[neurotransmitter]]s are most important. However, it is probably safe to say that whatever neurochemical abnormalities wind up being shown definitively to underlie [[depression]], there is precedent for stress and [[glucocorticoid]]s causing those same abnormalities.
