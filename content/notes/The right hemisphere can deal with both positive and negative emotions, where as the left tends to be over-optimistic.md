## The right hemisphere can deal with both positive and negative emotions, where as the left tends to be over-optimistic  # 

The [[right hemisphere]] is more in tune with sadness, and less with anger, than the [[left hemisphere]]; and that what we call positive emotions rely on both. While the [[right hemisphere]] is associated with positive affect in many cases, and may even be the principle source of pleasurable experience, it is in general the [[left hemisphere]] that tends to take a more optimistic view of the self and the future. In fact there is evidence that it may take an unwarrantedly optimistic view.

Once again the [[right hemisphere]]'s range is more inclusive (it can deal with either), and the [[left hemisphere]]'s more partial. It is believed that the emotions which are related to bonding and empathy, whether ‘positive’ or ‘negative’, are preferentially treated by the [[right hemisphere]], as one would expect: such stimuli capture [[right hemisphere]] attention. By the same token, those to do with competition, rivalry and individual self-belief, positive or negative, would be preferentially treated by the [[left hemisphere]].
