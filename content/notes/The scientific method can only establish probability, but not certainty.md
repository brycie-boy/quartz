## The scientific method can only establish probability, but not certainty # 
 
[[Because perception is not absolute, our models of reality are all somewhat conjectural and inferential]]. The [[scientific method]] is the alleged source of the certitude of [[the New Idolators]]. The [[scientific method]] is a mixture of sense data, usually aided by instruments to refine the senses, and with the old Greek [[pure reason]]. Unfortunately, while SM is powerfully effective, and seems to most of us the best method yet devised by mankind, it is made up of two elements which we have already seen are fallible‚Äîsense data ([[the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input]]) and [[pure reason]] can both deceive us. Again: two fallibilities do not add up to one infallibility. Scientific generalizations which have lasted a long time have _high probability_, perhaps the highest probability of any generalizations, but it is only [[Idolatry]] which claims none of them will ever again have to be revised or rejected. Too many have been revised or rejected in this century alone.
