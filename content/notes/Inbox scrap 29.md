There is one other, subtler aspect to this epidemic. Over the past twenty-five years, psychiatry has profoundly reshaped our society. Through its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, psychiatry draws a line between what is “normal” and what is not. Our societal understanding of the human mind, which in the past arose from a medley of sources (great works of fiction, scientific investigations, and philosophical and religious writings), is now filtered through the DSM.

20

Indeed, the stories told by psychiatry about “chemical imbalances” in the brain have reshaped our understanding of how the mind works and challenged our conceptions of free will. Are we really the prisoners of our neurotransmitters?

20

Most important, our children are the first in human history to grow up under the constant shadow of “mental illness.” Not too long ago, goof-offs, cutups, bullies, nerds, shy kids, teachers’ pets, and any number of other recognizable types filled the schoolyard, and all were considered more or less normal. Nobody really knew what to expect from such children as adults. That was part of the glorious uncertainty of life—the goof-off in the fifth grade might show up at his high school’s twenty-year reunion as a wealthy entrepreneur, the shy girl as an accomplished actress. But today, children diagnosed with mental disorders—most notably, ADHD, depression, and bipolar illness—help populate the schoolyard. These children have been told that they have something wrong with their brains and that they may have to take psychiatric medications the rest of their lives, just like a “diabetic takes insulin.” That medical dictum teaches all of the children on the playground a lesson about the nature of human kind, and that lesson differs in a radical way from what children used to be taught.

The Hunt for Chemical Imbalances

115

Antipsychotics, antidepressants, and other psychotropic drugs, he wrote, “create perturbations in neurotansmitter functions.” In response, the brain goes through a series of compensatory adaptations. If a drug blocks a neurotransmitter (as an antipsychotic does), the presynaptic neurons spring into hyper gear and release more of it, and the postsynaptic neurons increase the density of their receptors for that chemical messenger. Conversely, if a drug increases the synaptic levels of a neurotransmitter (as an antidepressant does), it provokes the opposite response: The presynaptic neurons decrease their firing rates and the postsynaptic neurons decrease the density of their receptors for the neurotransmitter. In each instance, the brain is trying to nullify the drug’s effects. “These adaptations,” Hyman explained, “are rooted in homeostatic mechanisms that exist, presumably, to permit cells to maintain their equilibrium in the face of alterations in the environment or changes in the internal milieu.”

116

However, after a period of time, these compensatory mechanisms break down. The “chronic administration” of the drug then causes “substantial and long-lasting alterations in neural function,” Hyman wrote. As part of this long-term adaptation process, there are changes in intracellular signaling pathways and gene expression. After a few weeks, he concluded, the person’s brain is functioning in a manner that is “qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from the normal state.”

116

what science had revealed was this: Prior to treatment, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression, and other psychiatric disorders do not suffer from any known “chemical imbalance.” However, once a person is put on a psychiatric medication, which, in one manner or another, throws a wrench into the usual mechanics of a neuronal pathway, his or her brain begins to function, as Hyman observed, abnormally.

117

Thorazine, Miltown, and Marsilid were all derived from compounds that had been developed for other purposes—for use in surgery or as possible “magic bullets” against infectious diseases. Those compounds were then found to cause alterations in mood, behavior, and thinking that were seen as helpful to psychiatric patients. The drugs, in essence, were perceived as having beneficial side effects. They perturbed normal function, and that understanding was reflected in the initial names given to them.

117

psychiatry then reconceived the drugs as “magic bullets” for mental disorders, the drugs hypothesized to be antidotes to chemical imbalances in the brain. But that theory, which arose as much from wishful thinking as from science, was investigated and it did not pan out.

115

Today, as provost of Harvard University, Steve Hyman is mostly engaged in the many political and administrative tasks that come with leading a large institution. But he is a neuroscientist by training, and in 1996 to 2001, when he was the director of the NIMH, he wrote a paper, one both memorable and provocative in kind, that summed up all that had been learned about psychiatric drugs. Titled “Initiation and Adaptation: A Paradigm for Understanding Psychotropic Drug Action,” it was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, and it told of how all psychotropic drugs could be understood to act on the brain in a common way.46

once a presynaptic neuron has released serotonin into the synaptic gap, it must be quickly removed so that the signal can be crisply terminated. An enzyme metabolizes a small amount; the rest is pumped back into the presynaptic neuron, entering via a channel known as SERT (serotonin reuptake transport). Fluoxetine blocks this reuptake channel, and as a result, Eli Lilly scientist James Clemens wrote in 1975, it causes a “pile-up of serotonin at the synapse.”36

110

However, as the Eli Lilly investigators discovered, a feedback mechanism then kicks in. The presynaptic neuron has “auto-receptors” on its terminal membrane that monitor the level of serotonin in the synapse. If serotonin levels are too low, one scientist quipped, these autoreceptors scream “turn on the serotonin machine.” If serotonin levels are too high, they scream “turn it off.” This is a feedback loop designed by evolution to keep the serotonergic system in balance, and fluoxetine triggers the latter message. With serotonin no longer being whisked away from the synapse, the autoreceptors tell the presynaptic neurons to fire at a dramatically lower rate. They begin to release lower-than-normal amounts of serotonin into the synapse.

110

Feedback mechanisms also change the postsynaptic neurons. Within four weeks, the density of their serotonin receptors drops 25 percent below normal, Eli Lilly scientists reported in 1981.37 Other investigators subsequently reported that “chronic fluoxetine treatment” may lead to a 50 percent reduction in serotonin receptors in certain areas of the brain.38 As a result, the post synaptic neurons become “desensitized” to the chemical messenger.

111

At this point, it may seem that the brain has successfully adapted to the drug. Fluoxetine blocks the normal reuptake of serotonin from the synapse, but the presynaptic neurons then begin releasing less serotonin and the postsynaptic neurons become less sensitive to serotonin and thus don’t fire so readily. The drug was designed to accelerate the serotonergic pathway; the brain responded by putting on the brake. It has kept its serotonergic pathway more or less in balance, an adaptive response that researchers have dubbed “synaptic resilience.”39 However, there is one other change that occurs during this initial two-week period, and it ultimately short-circuits the brain’s compensatory response. The autoreceptors for serotonin on the presynaptic neurons decline in number. As a result, this feedback mechanism becomes partially disabled, and the “turn off the serotonin machine” message dims. The presynaptic neurons begin to fire at a normal rate again, at least for a while, and to release more serotonin than normal each time. 40

112

the Eli Lilly researchers reasoned in 1981 that it was the decline in serotonin receptors, which took several weeks to occur, that was “the underlying mechanism associated with the therapeutic response.”41 If so, the drug could be said to work because it drove the serotonergic system into a less responsive state. But once researchers discovered that fluoxetine partially disabled the feedback mechanism, Claude de Montigny at McGill University argued that this was what allowed the drug to begin working. This disabling process also took two or three weeks to occur, and it allowed the presynaptic neurons to begin pumping higher amounts of serotonin than normal into the synapse. At that point, with fluoxetine continuing to block serotonin’s removal, the neurotransmitter could now indeed “pile up” in the synapse, and that would lead “to an enhancement of central serotonergic neurotransmission,” de Montigny wrote.

113

the medicine clearly doesn’t fix a chemical imbalance in the brain. Instead, it does precisely the opposite. Prior to being medicated, a depressed person has no known chemical imbalance. Fluoxetine then gums up the normal removal of serotonin from the synapse, and that triggers a cascade of changes, and several weeks later the serotonergic pathway is operating in a decidedly abnormal manner. The presynaptic neuron is putting out more serotonin than usual. Its serotonin reuptake channels are blocked by the drug. The system’s feedback loop is partially disabled. The postsynaptic neurons are “desensitized” to serotonin. Mechanically speaking, the serotonergic system is now rather mucked up.

114

During the 1970s and 1980s, researchers studying the effects of neuroleptics fleshed out a similar story. Thorazine and other standard antipsychotics block 70 to 90 percent of all D2 receptors in the brain. In response, the presynaptic neurons begin pumping out more dopamine and the postsynaptic neurons increase the density of their D2 receptors by 30 percent or more. In this manner, the brain is trying to “compensate” for the drug’s effects so that it can maintain the transmission of messages along its dopaminergic pathways. However, after about three weeks, the pathway’s feedback mechanism begins to fail, and the presynaptic neurons begin to fire in irregular patterns or turn quiescent. It is this “inactivation” of dopaminergic pathways that “may be the basis for the antipsychotic action,” explains the American Psychiatric Association’s Textbook of Psychopharmacology.45

493

45. Schatzberg, Textbook of Psychopharmacology, 619.

114

Once again, this is a story of neurotransmitter pathways that have been transformed by the medication. After several weeks, their feedback loops are partially disabled, the presynaptic neurons are releasing less dopamine than normal, the drug is thwarting dopamine’s effects by blocking D2 receptors, and the postsynaptic neurons have an abnormally high density of these receptors. The drugs do not normalize brain chemistry, but disturb it,

107

This became the storytelling formula that was relied upon by pharmaceutical companies again and again: Researchers would identify the mechanism of action for a class of drugs, how the drugs either lowered or raised levels of a brain neurotransmitter, and soon the public would be told that people treated with those medications suffered from the opposite problem.

108

Psychopharmacology, was embraced by psychiatrists because it “set the stage” for them “to become real doctors.”31 Doctors in internal medicine had their antibiotics, and now psychiatrists could have their “anti-disease” pills too.

104

However, even as Snyder and Seeman were reporting their results, Malcolm Bowers was announcing findings that cast a cloud over the dopamine hypothesis. He had measured the level of dopamine metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid of unmedicated schizophrenics and found them to be quite normal. “Our findings,” he wrote, “do not furnish neurochemical evidence for an over-arousal in these patients emanating from a midbrain dopamine system.”17 Others soon reported similar results. In 1975, Robert Post at the NIMH determined that HVA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of twenty unmedicated schizophrenics “were not significantly different from controls.”18 Autopsy studies also revealed that the brain tissue of drug-free schizophrenics did not have abnormal levels of dopamine. In 1982, UCLA’s John Haracz reviewed this body of research and drew the obvious bottom-line conclusion: “These findings do not support the presence of elevated dopamine turnover in the brains of [unmedicated] schizophrenics.”19

105

Having discovered that dopamine levels in never-medicated schizophrenics were normal, researchers turned their attention to a second possibility. Perhaps people with schizophrenia had an overabundance of dopamine receptors. If so, the postsynaptic neurons would be “hypersensitive” to dopamine, and this would cause the dopaminergic pathways to be overstimulated. In 1978, Philip See-man at the University of Toronto announced in Nature that this was indeed the case. At autopsy, the brains of twenty schizophrenics had 70 percent more D2 receptors than normal. At first glance, it seemed that the cause of schizophrenia had been found, but Seeman cautioned that all of the patients had been on neuroleptics prior to their deaths. “Although these results are apparently compatible with the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia in general,” he wrote, the increase in D2 receptors might “have resulted from the long-term administration of neuroleptics.”20

A variety of studies quickly proved that the drugs were indeed the culprit. When rats were fed neuroleptics, their D2 receptors quickly increased in number.21 If rats were given a drug that blocked D1 receptors, that receptor subtype increased in density.22 In each instance, the increase was evidence of the brain trying to compensate for the drug’s blocking of its signals. Then, in 1982, Angus MacKay and his British colleagues reported that when they examined brain tissue from forty-eight deceased schizophrenics, “the increases in [D2] receptors were seen only in patients in whom neuroleptic medication had been maintained until the time of death, indicating that they were entirely iatrogenic [drug-caused].”23 A few years later, German investigators reported the same results from their autopsy studies.24 Finally, investigators in France, Sweden, and Finland used positron emission topography to study D2-receptor densities in living patients who had never been exposed to neuroleptics, and all reported “no significant differences” between the schizophrenics and “normal controls.”25

In a study of eight depressed patients (all of whom had been previously exposed to antidepressants), he announced that their 5-HIAA levels were lower than normal, but not “significantly” so.3 Two years later, investigators at McGill University said that they, too, had failed to find a “statistically significant” difference in the 5-HIAA levels of depressed patients and normal controls, and that they also had failed to find any correlation between 5-HIAA levels and the severity of depressive symptoms.4 In 1974, Bowers was back with a more finely tuned follow-up study: Depressed patients who had not been exposed to antidepressants had perfectly normal 5-HIAA levels.5

It seemed that the theory was about to be declared dead and buried, but then, in 1975, Marie Asberg and her colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm breathed new life into it. Twenty of the sixty-eight depressed patients they had tested suffered from low 5-HIAA levels, and these low-serotonin patients were somewhat more suicidal than the rest, with two of the twenty eventually committing suicide. This was evidence, the Swedish researchers said, that there might be “a biochemical subgroup of depressive disorder characterized by a disturbance of serotonin turnover.”8

Soon prominent psychiatrists in the United States were writing that “nearly 30 percent” of depressed patients had been found to have low serotonin levels. The serotonin theory of depression seemed at least partly vindicated.

100

But today, if we revisit Asberg’s study and examine her data, we can see that her finding of a “biological subgroup” of depressed patients was mostly a story of wishful thinking.

In her study, Asberg reported that 25 percent of her “normal” group had cerebrospinal 5-HIAA levels below fifteen nanograms per milliliter. Fifty percent had fifteen to twenty-five nanograms of 5-HIAA per milliliter, and the remaining 25 percent had levels above twenty-five nanograms. The bell curve for her “normals” showed that 5-HIAA levels were quite variable. But what she failed to note in her discussion was that the bell curve for the sixty-eight depressed patients in her study was almost exactly the same. Twenty-nine percent (twenty of the sixty-eight) had 5-HIAA counts below fifteen nanograms, 47 percent had levels between fifteen and twenty-five nanograms, and 24 percent had levels above twenty-five nanograms. Twenty-nine percent of depressed patients may have had “low” levels of serotonin metabolites in their cerebrospinal fluid (this was her “biological subgroup”), but then so did 25 percent of “normal” people. The median level for normals was twenty nanograms, and, it so turned out, more than half of the depressed patients—thirty-seven of sixty-eight—had levels above that amount.

101

Viewed in this way, her study had not provided any new reason to believe in the serotonin theory of depression. Japanese investigators soon revealed, in an unwitting way, the faulty logic at work. They reported that some antidepressants (used in Japan) blocked serotonin receptors, inhibiting the firing of those pathways, and thus they reasoned that depression might be caused by an “excess of free serotonin in the synaptic cleft.”9 They had applied the same backwards reasoning that had given rise to the low-serotonin theory of depression, and if the Japanese scientists had wanted to, they could have pointed to Asberg’s study for support of their theory, as the Swedes had found that 24 percent of depressed patients had “high” levels of serotonin.

102

In 1984, NIMH investigators studied the low-serotonin theory of depression one more time. They wanted to see whether the “biological subgroup” of depressed patients with “low” levels of serotonin were the best responders to an antidepressant, amitriptyline, that selectively blocked its reuptake. If an antidepressant was an antidote to a chemical imbalance in the brain, then amitriptyline should be most effective in that subgroup. But, lead investigator James Maas wrote, “contrary to expectations, no relationships between cerebrospinal 5-HIAA and response to amitriptyline were found.”10 Moreover, he and the other NIMH researchers discovered—just as Asberg had—that 5-HIAA levels varied widely in depressed patients. Some had high levels of serotonin metabolites in their cerebrospinal fluid, while others had low levels. The NIMH scientists drew the only possible conclusion: “Elevations or decrements in the functioning of serotonergic systems per se are not likely to be associated with depression.”*

103

Even after this report, the serotonin theory of depression did not completely go away. The commercial success of Prozac, a “selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor” brought to market in 1988 by Eli Lilly, fueled a new round of public claims that depression was due to low levels of this neurotransmitter, and once again any number of investigators conducted experiments to see if that were so. But this second round of studies produced the same results as the first. “I spent the first several years of my career doing full-time research on brain serotonin metabolism, but I never saw any convincing evidence that any psychiatric disorder, including depression, results from a deficiency of brain serotonin,” said Stanford psychiatrist David Burns in 2003.11 Numerous others made this same point. “There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that clinical depression is due to any kind of biological deficit state,” wrote Colin Ross, an associate professor of psychiatry at Southwest Medical Center in Dallas, in his 1995 book, Pseudoscience in Biological Psychiatry.12 In 2000, the authors of Essential Psychopharmacology told medical students “there is no clear and convincing evidence that monoamine deficiency accounts for depression; that is, there is no ‘real’ monoamine deficit.”13 Yet, fueled by pharmaceutical advertisements, the belief lived on, and it caused Irish psychiatrist David Healy, who has written a number of books on the history of psychiatry, to quip in 2005 that this theory needed to be put into the medical dustbin, where other such discredited theories can be found. “The serotonin theory of depression,” he wrote, with evident exasperation, “is comparable to the masturbatory theory of insanity.”14

95

The mechanics of its messaging system are fairly well understood. There are, Cha noted, 100 billion neurons in the human brain. The cell body of a “typical” neuron receives input from a vast web of dendrites, and it sends out a signal via a single axon that may project to a distant area of the brain (or down the spinal cord). At its end, an axon branches into numerous terminals, and it is from these terminals that chemical messengers—dopamine, serotonin, etc.—are released into the synaptic cleft, which is a gap about twenty nanometers wide (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). A single neuron has between one thousand and ten thousand synaptic connections, with the adult brain as a whole having perhaps 150 trillion synapses.

96

The axons of neurons that use the same neurotransmitter are regularly bundled together, almost like the strands of a telecommunications cable, and once scientists discovered that dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin fluoresced different colors when exposed to formaldehyde vapors, it became possible to track those neurotransmitter pathways in the brain.

96

The serotonergic pathway is one with ancient evolutionary roots. Serotonergic neurons are found in the nervous systems of all vertebrates and most invertebrates, and in humans their cell bodies are located in the brain stem, in an area known as the raphe nuclei. Some of these neurons send long axons down the spinal cord, a system that is involved in the control of respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal activities. Other serotonergic neurons have axons that ascend into all areas of the brain—the cerebellum, the hypothalamus, the basal ganglia, the temporal lobes, the limbic system, the cerebral cortex, and the frontal lobes. This pathway is involved in memory, learning, sleep, appetite, and the regulation of moods and behaviors. As Efrain Azmitia, a professor of biology at NYU, has noted, “the brain serotonin system is the single largest brain system known and can be characterized as a ‘giant’ neuronal system.”2

97

There are three major dopaminergic pathways in the brain. The cell bodies of all three systems are located atop the brain stem, in either the substantia nigra or the ventral tegmentum. Their axons project to the basal ganglia (nigrostriatal system), the limbic region (mesolimbic system), and the frontal lobes (mesocortical system). The basal ganglia initiates and controls movement. The limbic structures—the olfactory tubercle, the nucleus accumbens, and the amygdala, among others—are located behind the frontal lobes and help regulate our emotions. It is here that we feel the world, a process that is vital to our sense of self and our conceptions of reality. The frontal lobes are the most distinguishing feature of the human brain, and provide us with the godlike capacity to monitor our own selves.

97

All of this physiology—the 100 billion neurons, the 150 trillion synapses, the various neurotransmitter pathways—tell of a brain that is almost infinitely complex. Yet the chemical imbalance theory of mental disorders boiled this complexity down to a simple disease mechanism, one easy to grasp.

Aristotelian logic

97

In depression, the problem was that the serotonergic neurons released too little serotonin into the synaptic gap, and thus the serotonergic pathways in the brain were “underactive.” Antidepressants brought serotonin levels in the synaptic gap up to normal, and that allowed these pathways to transmit messages at a proper pace. Meanwhile, the hallucinations and voices that characterized schizophrenia resulted from overactive dopaminergic pathways. Either the presynaptic neurons pumped out too much dopamine into the synapse or the target neurons had an abnormally high density of dopamine receptors. Antipsychotics put a brake on this system, and this allowed the dopaminergic pathways to function in a more normal manner.

That was the chemical imbalance theory put forth by Schildkraut and Jacques Van Rossum,

98

and the very research that had led Schildkraut to his hypothesis also provided investigators with a method for testing it. The studies of iproniazid and imipramine had shown that neurotransmitters were removed from the synapse in one of two ways. Either the chemical was taken back up into the presynaptic neuron and restored for later use, or it was metabolized by an enzyme and carted off as waste. Serotonin is metabolized into 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA); dopamine is turned into homo vanillic acid (HVA). Researchers could comb the cerebrospinal fluid for these metabolites, and the amounts found would serve as an indirect gauge of the synaptic levels of the neurotransmitters. Since low serotonin was theorized to cause depression, anyone in that emotional state should have lower-than-normal levels of 5-HIAA in his or her cerebrospinal fluid. Similarly, since an overactive dopamine system was theorized to cause schizophrenia, people who heard voices or were paranoid should have abnormally high cerebrospinal levels of HVA.

Psychiatry’s Magic Bullets

78

Such were the drugs that launched the psychopharmacology revolution. In the short span of three years (1954–1957), psychiatry gained new medicines for quieting agitated and manic patients in asylums, for anxiety, and for depression. But none of these drugs had been developed after scientists had identified any disease process or brain abnormality that might have been causing these symptoms. They arrived out of the post–World War II search for magic bullets against infectious diseases, with researchers, during that process, stumbling on compounds that affected the central nervous system in novel ways. The animal tests of chlorpromazine, meprobamate, and chlordiazepoxide revealed that these agents sharply curbed normal physical and emotional responses, but did so without causing a loss of consciousness. That was what was so novel about the major and minor tranquilizers. They curbed brain function in a selective manner. It was unclear how iproniazid worked—it seemed to rev up the brain in some way—but, as the New York Times had noted, its mood-lifting properties were properly seen as a “side effect” of an anti-tuberculosis agent.

Miracle Pills

83

Smith Kline and French, which obtained a license from Rhône-Poulenc to sell chlorpromazine in the United States, secured FDA approval for Thorazine on March 26, 1954. A few days later, the company used its March of Medicine show to launch the product. Although Smith Kline and French had spent only $350,000 developing Thorazine, having administered it to fewer than 150 psychiatric patients prior to submitting its application to the FDA, the company’s president, Francis Boyer, told viewers that this was a product that had gone through the most rigorous testing imaginable. “It was administered to well over five thousand animals and proved active and safe for human administration,” he said. “We then placed the compound in the hands of physicians in our great American medical centers to explore its clinical value and possible limitations. In all, over two thousand doctors in this country and Canada have used it…. The development of a new medicine is difficult and costly, but it is a job our industry is privileged to perform.”21

83

Boyer’s was a story of rigorous science at work, and less than three months later, Time, in an article titled “Wonder Drug of 1954?,” pronounced Thorazine a “star performer.” After a dose of Thorazine, the magazine explained, patients “sit up and talk sense with [the doctor], perhaps for the first time in months.”22 In a follow-up article, Time reported that patients “willingly took [the] pills” and that once they did, they “fed themselves, ate heartily and slept well.” Thorazine, the magazine concluded, was as important “as the germ-killing sulfas discovered in the 1930s.”23

84

This was a magic-bullet reference that was impossible to miss, and other newspapers and magazines echoed that theme. Thanks to chlorpromazine, U.S. News and World Report explained, “patients who were formerly untreatable within a matter of weeks or months become sane, rational human beings.”24 The New York Times, in a series of articles in 1954 and 1955, called Thorazine a “miracle” pill that brought psychiatric patients “peace of mind” and “freedom from confusion.” Thorazine, newspapers and magazines agreed, had ushered in a “new era of psychiatry.”25

With such stories being told about Thorazine, it was little wonder that the public went gaga when Miltown, in the spring of 1955, was introduced into the market. This drug, Time reported, was for “walk-in neurotics rather than locked-in psychotics,” and according to what psychiatrists were telling newspaper and magazine reporters, it had amazing properties.26 Anxiety and worries fled so quickly, Changing Times explained, that it could be considered a “happy pill.” Reader’s Digest likened it to a “Turkish bath in a tablet.” The drug, explained Consumer Reports, “does not deaden or dull the senses, and it is not habit forming. It relaxes the muscles, calms the mind, and gives people a renewed ability to enjoy life.”27

86

There was one slightly hesitant note that appeared in newspaper and magazine articles during the introduction of Thorazine and Miltown. In the 1950s, many of the psychiatrists at top American medical schools were Freudians, who believed that mental disorders were caused by psychological conflicts, and their influence led Smith Kline and French, in its initial promotion of Thorazine, to caution reporters that “there is no thought that chlorpromazine is a cure for mental illness, but it can have great value if it relaxes patients and makes them accessible to treatment.”29 Both Thorazine and Miltown, explained the New York Times, should be considered as “adjuncts to psychotherapy, not the cure.”30

87

Yet, in very short order, even this note of caution went by the wayside. In 1957, the New York Times reported that researchers now believed that iproniazid might be a “potent regulator of unbalanced cerebral metabolism.”32 This suggested that the drug, which had been developed to fight tuberculosis, might be fixing something that was wrong in the brains of depressed patients.

87

psychiatrist Harold Himwich, in a 1958 article in Science, explained that they “may be compared with the advent of insulin, which counteracts symptoms of diabetes.”34 The antidepressants were fixing something wrong in the brain, and when Hoffmann-La Roche brought Librium to market in 1960, it picked up on this curative message. Its new drug was not just another tranquilizer, but rather “the successor to this entire group…. Librium is the biggest step yet toward ‘pure’ anxiety relief as distinct from central sedation or hypnotic action.”35 Merck did the same, marketing its drug Suavitil as “a mood normalizer…. Suavitil offers a new and specific type of neurochemical treatment for the patient who is disabled by anxiety, tension, depression, or obsessive-compulsive manifestations.”36

88

With this pronouncement by the NIMH, the transformation of the psychiatric drugs was basically complete. In the beginning, Thorazine and other neuroleptics had been viewed as agents that made patients quieter and emotionally indifferent. Now they were “antipsychotic” medications. Muscle relaxants that had been developed for use in psychiatry because of their “taming” properties were now “mood normalizers.” The psychic energizers were “antidepressants.” All of these drugs were apparently antidotes to specific disorders, and in that sense, they deserved to be compared to antibiotics. They were disease-fighting agents, rather than mere tonics. All that was missing from this story of magic-bullet medicine was an understanding of the biology of mental disorders, but with the drugs reconceived in this way, once researchers came to understand how the drugs affected the brain, they developed two hypotheses that, at least in theory, filled in this gap.

87

The final step in this image makeover of the psychiatric drugs came in 1963. The NIMH had conducted a six-week trial of Thorazine and other neuroleptics, and after these drugs were shown to be more effective than a placebo in knocking down psychotic symptoms, the researchers concluded that that the drugs should be regarded “as antischizophrenic in the broad sense. In fact, it is questionable whether the term ‘tranquilizer’ should be retained.”37

The Epidemic Spreads to Children

299

The notion that stimulants might be beneficial for such children arose in 1937, when Charles Bradley gave a newly synthesized amphetamine, Benzedrine, to hyperactive children who complained of headaches. Although the drug didn’t cure their head pain, Bradley reported that it “subdued” the children and helped them concentrate better on their schoolwork. The children dubbed Benzedrine the “arithmetic pill.”6

299

soon deemed this new drug useful for quieting “disturbed” children who were thought to be suffering from a “brain damage syndrome.”7

300

There was no great rush by psychiatrists during the 1960s to prescribe Ritalin to fidgety children who went to regular schools. At that time, there was a sense that psychoactive drugs, because of their many risks, should be administered only to hospitalized children, or children in residential facilities. The population of children so hyperactive that they might be diagnosed with “organic brain dysfunction” was small. However, psychiatry’s use of Ritalin slowly began to climb during the 1970s, such that by the end of the decade perhaps 150,000 children in the United States were taking the drug. Then, in 1980, the field published a third edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III), and it identified “attention-deficit disorder” as a disease for the first time. The cardinal symptoms were “hyperactivity,” “inattention,” and “impulsivity,” and given that many children fidget in their seats and have trouble paying attention in school, the diagnosis of ADD began to take off. In 1987, psychiatry further loosened the diagnostic boundaries, renaming it attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in a revised edition of DSM-III. Next, Ciba-Geigy helped fund Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), a “patient-support group” that immediately began promoting public awareness of this “disease.” Finally, in 1991, CHADD successfully lobbied Congress to include ADHD as a disability that would be covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children diagnosed with ADHD were now eligible for special services, which were to be funded with federal money, and schools regularly began identifying children who seemed to have this condition. As the Harvard Review of Psychiatry noted in 2009, even today the diagnosis of ADHD arises primarily from teacher complaints, as “only a minority of children with the disorder exhibit symptoms during a physician’s office visit.”8

301

Suddenly, ADHD children could be found in every classroom. The number of children so diagnosed rose to nearly 1 million in 1990, and more than doubled over the next five years. Today, perhaps 3.5 million American children take a stimulant for ADHD, with the Centers for Disease Control reporting in 2007 that one in every twenty-three American children four to seventeen years old is so medicated. This prescribing practice is mostly a U.S. phenomenon—children here consume three times the quantity of stimulants consumed by the rest of the world’s children combined.

301

Although the public often hears that research has shown that ADHD is a “brain disease,” the truth is that its etiology remains unknown. “Attempts to define a biological basis for ADHD have been consistently unsuccessful,” wrote pediatric neurologist Gerald Golden in 1991. “The neuroanatomy of the brain, as demonstrated by imaging studies, is normal. No neuropathologic substrate has been demonstrated.”9 Seven years later, a panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Health reiterated this same point: “After years of clinical research and experience with ADHD, our knowledge about the cause or causes of ADHD remains largely speculative.”10

301

During the 1990s, CHADD advised the public that children with ADHD suffered from a chemical imbalance, characterized by an underactive dopamine system, but that was simply a drug-marketing claim. Ritalin and other stimulants increase dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft, and thus CHADD was attempting to make it seem that such drugs “normalized” brain chemistry, but, as the American Psychiatric Press’s 1997 Textbook of Neuropsychiatry confessed, “efforts to identify a selective neurochemical imbalance [in ADHD children] have been disappointing.”11

302

So we see in this history that nothing new was discovered that told of a “mental illness” called ADHD. There was a long record of speculation within medicine that extremely hyperactive children suffered from brain dysfunction of some kind, which was certainly a reasonable thought, but the nature of that dysfunction was never discerned, and then, in 1980, psychiatry simply created, with a stroke of its pen in DSM-III, a dramatically expanded definition of “hyperactivity.” The fidgety seven-year-old boy who might have been dubbed a “goof-off” in 1970 was now suffering from a psychiatric disorder.

302

Given that the biology of ADHD remains unknown, it is fair to say that Ritalin and other ADHD drugs “work” by perturbing neurotransmitter systems. Ritalin could best be described as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. At a therapeutic dose, it blocks 70 percent of the “transporters” that remove dopamine from the synaptic cleft and bring it back into the presynaptic neuron. Cocaine acts on the brain in the same way. However, methylphenidate clears much more slowly from the brain than cocaine does, and thus it blocks dopamine reuptake for hours, as opposed to cocaine’s relatively brief disruption of this function.*

303

In response to methylphenidate, the child’s brain goes through a series of compensatory adaptations. Dopamine is now remaining in the synaptic cleft too long, and so the child’s brain dials down its dopamine machinery. The density of dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic neurons declines. At the same time, the amount of dopamine metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid drops, evidence that the presynaptic neurons are releasing less of it.

303

Ritalin also acts on serotonin and norepinephrine neurons, and that causes similar compensatory changes in those two pathways. Receptor densities for serotonin and norepinephrine decline, and the output of those two chemicals by presynaptic neurons is altered as well. The child’s brain is now operating, as Steven Hyman said, in a manner that is “qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from the normal state.”12

303

Ritalin and other ADHD drugs do reliably change a child’s behavior, and in his 1937 report, Charles Bradley set the stage for the efficacy story that eventually emerged: “Fifteen of the thirty children responded to Benzedrine by becoming distinctly subdued in their emotional responses. Clinically in all cases this was an improvement from the social viewpoint.”13 Ritalin, which the FDA approved for use in children in 1961, was found to have a similar subduing effect. In a 1978 double-blind study, Ohio State University psychologist Herbert Rie studied twenty-eight “hyperactive” children for three months, half of whom were prescribed methylphenidate. Here is what he wrote:

Children who were retrospectively confirmed to have been on active drug treatment appeared, at the times of evaluation, distinctly more bland or “flat” emotionally, lacking both the age-typical variety and frequency of emotional expression. They responded less, exhibited little or no initiative or spontaneity, offered little indication of either interest or aversion, showed virtually no curiosity, surprise, or pleasure, and seemed devoid of humor. Jocular comments and humorous situations passed unnoticed. In short, while on active drug treatment, the children were relatively but unmistakably affectless, humorless, and apathetic.14

Numerous investigators reported similar observations. Children on Ritalin show “a marked drug-related increase in solitary play and a corresponding reduction in their initiation of social interactions,” announced Russell Barkley, a psychologist at the Medical College of Wisconsin, in 1978.15 This drug, observed Bowling Green State University psychologist Nancy Fiedler, reduced a child’s “curiosity about the environment.”16 At times, the medicated child “loses his sparkle,” wrote Canadian pediatrician Till Davy in 1989.17 Children treated with a stimulant, concluded a team of UCLA psychologists in 1993, often become “passive, submissive” and “socially withdrawn.”18 Some children on the drug “seem zombie-like,” noted psychologist James Swanson, director of an ADHD center at the University of California, Irvine.19 Stimulants, explained the editors of the Oxford Textbook of Clinical Psychophamacology and Drug Therapy, curb hyperactivity by “reducing the number of behavioral responses.”20

The problem with it being right from a social context is that I never asked to be around these people. I was never a problem until I was forced to interact with these people. I never diagnosed myself

All of these reports told the same story. On Ritalin, a student who previously had been an annoyance in the classroom, fidgeting too much in his or her chair or talking to a nearby classmate while the teacher scribbled on the blackboard, would be stilled. The student wouldn’t move around as much and wouldn’t engage as much socially with his or her peers. If given a task like answering arithmetic problems, the student might focus intently on it. Charles Bradley thought this change in behavior was “an improvement from the social viewpoint,” and it is that perspective that shows up in efficacy trials of Ritalin and other ADHD drugs. Teachers and other observers fill out rating instruments that view a reduction in the child’s movements and engagement with others as positive, and when the results are tabulated, 70 to 90 percent of the children are reported to be “good responders” to ADHD medications. These drugs, NIMH investigators wrote in 1995, are highly effective in “dramatically reducing a range of core ADHD symptoms such as task-irrelevant activity (e.g., finger tapping, fidgetiness, fine motor movement, off-task [behavior] during direct observation) and classroom disturbance.”21 ADHD experts at Massachusetts General Hospital summed up the scientific literature in a similar way: “The extant literature clearly documents that stimulants diminish behaviors prototypical of ADHD, including motoric overactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness.”22

However, none of this tells of drug treatment that benefits the child. Stimulants work for the teacher, but do they help the child? Here, right from the start, researchers ran into a wall. “Above all else,” wrote Esther Sleator, a physician at the University of Illinois who asked fifty-two children what they thought of Ritalin, “we found a pervasive dislike among hyperactive children for taking stimulants.”23 Children on Ritalin, University of Texas psychologist Deborah Jacobvitz reported in 1990, rated themselves as “less happy and [less] pleased with themselves and more dysphoric.” When it came to helping a child make friends and sustain friendships, stimulants produced “few significant positive effects and a high incidence of negative effects,” Jacobvitz said.24 Other researchers detailed how Ritalin harmed a child’s self-esteem, as the children felt they must be “bad” or “dumb” if they had to take such a pill. “The child comes to believe not in the soundness of his own brain and body, not in his own growing ability to learn and to control his behavior, but in ‘my magic pills that make me into a good boy,’” said University of Minnesota psychologist Alan Sroufe.25

All of this told of harm done, of a drug that made a child depressed, lonely, and filled with a sense of inadequacy, and when researchers looked at whether Ritalin at least helped hyperactive children fare well academically, to get good grades and thus succeed as students, they found that it wasn’t so. Being able to focus intently on a math test, it turned out, didn’t translate into long-term academic achievement. This drug, Sroufe explained in 1973, enhances performance on “repetitive, routinized tasks that require sustained attention,” but “reasoning, problem solving and learning do not seem to be [positively] affected.”26 Five years later, Herbert Rie was much more negative. He reported that Ritalin did not produce any benefit on the students’ “vocabulary, reading, spelling, or math,” and hindered their ability to solve problems. “The reactions of the children strongly suggest a reduction in commitment of the sort that would seem critical for learning.”27 That same year, Russell Barkley at the Medical College of Wisconsin reviewed the relevant scientific literature and concluded “the major effect of stimulants appears to be an improvement in classroom manageability rather than academic performance.”28 Next it was James Swanson’s turn to weigh in. The fact that the drugs often left children “isolated, withdrawn and overfocused” could “impair rather than improve learning,” he said.29 Carol Whalen, a psychologist from the University of California at Irvine, noted in 1997 that “especially worrisome has been the suggestion that the unsalutary effects [of Ritalin] occur in the realm of complex, high-order cognitive functions such as flexible problem-solving or divergent thinking.”30 Finally, in 2002, Canadian investigators conducted a meta-analysis of the literature, reviewing fourteen studies involving 1,379 youths that had lasted at least three months, and they determined that there was “little evidence for improved academic performance.”31

There was one other disappointment with Ritalin. When researchers looked at whether stimulants improved a child’s behavior over the long term, they couldn’t find any benefit. When a child stopped taking Ritalin, ADHD behaviors regularly flared up, the “excitability, impulsivity, or talkativeness” worse than ever. “It is often disheartening to observe how rapidly behavior deteriorates when medication is discontinued,” Whalen confessed.32 Nor was there evidence that staying on a stimulant led to a sustained improvement in behavior. “Teachers and parents should not expect long-term improvement in academic achievement or reduced antisocial behavior,” Swanson wrote in 1993.33 The 1994 edition of the APA’s Textbook of Psychiatry admitted to the same bottom-line conclusion: “Stimulants do not produce lasting improvements in aggressivity, conduct disorder, criminality, education achievement, job functioning, marital relationships, or long-term adjustment.”34 Thirty years of research had failed to provide any good-quality evidence that stimulants helped “hyperactive” children thrive, and in the early 1990s, a team of prominent ADHD experts picked to lead a long-term NIMH study, known as the Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD, acknowledged that this was so. “The long-term efficacy of stimulant medication has not been demonstrated for any domain of child functioning,” they wrote.35

The NIMH touted its ADHD study as “the first major clinical trial” the institute had ever conducted of “a childhood mental disorder.” However, it was a rather flawed intellectual exercise right from the start. Although the investigators, led by Peter Jensen, associate director of child and adolescent research at the NIMH, acknowledged during the planning stages that there was no evidence in the scientific literature that stimulants improved long-term outcomes, they did not include a placebo control in the study, reasoning that it would have been “unethical” to withhold “treatment of known efficacy” for an extended period. The study basically compared drug treatment to behavioral therapy, but in that latter group, 20 percent were on a stimulant at the start of the trial, and there never was a time during the fourteen months that all of the children in that group were off such medication.36

309

Despite this obvious design flaw, the NIMH-funded investigators declared victory for the stimulants at the end of fourteen months. “Carefully crafted medication management” had proven to be “superior” to behavioral treatment in terms of reducing core ADHD symptoms. There was also a hint that the medicated children had fared better on reading tests (although not in other academic subjects), and as a result, psychiatry now had a long-term study that documented the continuing benefits of stimulants. “Since ADHD is now regarded by most experts as a chronic disorder, ongoing treatment often seems necessary,” the researchers concluded.37

After that initial fourteen-month period of treatment, the investigators followed up periodically with the students, assessing how they were doing and whether they were taking an ADHD medication.

310

At the end of three years, Jensen and the others discovered that “medication use was a significant marker not of beneficial outcome, but of deterioration. That is, participants using medication in the 24-to-36 month period actually showed increased symptomatology during that interval relative to those not taking medication.”38

In other words, those on medications saw their core ADHD symptoms—the impulsiveness, the inattentiveness, the hyperactivity—worsen, at least in comparison to those not on drugs. In addition, those on meds had higher “delinquency scores” at the end of three years, which meant they were more likely to get into trouble in school and with the police.39 They were also now shorter and weighed less than their off-med counterparts, evidence that the drugs suppressed growth. These results told of a drug therapy causing long-term harm, and when the NIMH-funded investigators reported on six-year outcomes, the findings remained the same. Medication use was “associated with worse hyperactivity-impulsivity and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms” and with greater “overall functional impairment.”40

Ritalin and the other ADHD medications cause a long list of physical, emotional, and psychiatric adverse effects. The physical problems include drowsiness, appetite loss, lethargy, insomnia, headaches, abdominal pain, motor abnormalities, facial and vocal tics, jaw clenching, skin problems, liver disorders, weight loss, growth suppression, hypertension, and sudden cardiac death. The emotional difficulties include depression, apathy, a general dullness, mood swings, crying jags, irritability, anxiety, and a sense of hostility toward the world. The psychiatric problems include obsessive-compulsive symptoms, mania, paranoia, psychotic episodes, and hallucinations. Methylphenidate also reduces blood flow and glucose metabolism in the brain, changes that usually are associated with “neuropathologic states.”42

312

Animal studies of stimulants are also cause for alarm. Repeated exposure to amphetamines, scientists at the Yale School of Medicine reported in 1999, caused monkeys to exhibit “aberrant behaviors” that remained long after the drug exposure had stopped.43 Various rat studies suggested that lengthy exposure to methylphenidate might cause dopaminergic pathways to become permanently desensitized, and since dopamine is the brain’s “reward system,” medicating the child may produce an adult with a “reduced ability to experience pleasure.”44 Scientists at Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas found that “preadolescent” rats exposed to methylphenidate for fifteen days turned into anxious, depressed “adult” rats. The adult rats moved around less, were less responsive to novel environments, and showed a “deficit in sexual behavior.” They concluded that “administration of methylphenidate” while the brain is still developing “results in aberrant behavioral adaptations during adulthood.”45

The FDA did approve Prozac for use in children, as two of the three positive studies reviewed by Laughren had come from trials of this drug. But, as many critics have pointed out, from a scientific perspective, there is no reason to think that Prozac is any better than the other SSRIs. The percentage of children who responded to Prozac in the two positive trials was similar to the drug response rate in the twelve failed trials; Eli Lilly simply had been better at using biased trial designs to make it appear that its drug worked. For example, in one of the two Prozac trials, all of the children were initially put on placebo for one week, and if they got better during that period, they were excluded from the study. This helped knock down the placebo response rate. Next, the children who were randomized onto Prozac were evaluated for a week, and only those “who adapted well” to the drug were then enrolled in the study. This helped increase the drug response rate. “Before the study even started,” explained Jonathan Leo, editor in chief of the journal Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry, “there was a mechanism in place to maximize any difference between the drug and placebo groups—the placebo group was preselected for nonresponders, while the drug group was preselected for

Yet, even with this extremely biased trial design, the Prozac-treated children still fared no better than the placebo group on self-rating scales or ratings by their parents. In addition, the trial failed to show efficacy for fluoxetine on its “primary endpoint,” and thus efficacy arose entirely from a secondary “improvement” scale filled out by the psychiatrists paid by Eli Lilly to run the trial.

In the absence of any efficacy benefit, we are now left with the unhappy task of tallying up the harm done by the prescribing of antidepressants to children and teenagers. We can start with the physical problems. SSRIs may cause insomnia, sexual dysfunction, headaches, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness, tremors, nervousness, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, seizures, and a severe inner agitation known as akathisia, which is associated with an increased risk of violence and suicide. The psychiatric problems they can trigger are even more problematic. Timothy Wilens and Joseph Biederman at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted a chart review of eighty-two children treated with SSRIs, and determined that 22 percent of the children had suffered an adverse psychiatric event. Ten percent had become psychotic, and another 6 percent manic. “One of the most disturbing adverse outcomes is a worsening of emotional, cognitive or behavioral symptoms,” they wrote. “These psychiatric adverse events to medication can be significantly impairing.”55 North Carolina psychiatrist Thomas Gualtieri determined that 28 percent of the 128 children and adolescents he treated with SSRIs developed some type of “behavioral toxicity.”56 Other physicians have told of their SSRI-treated younger patients suffering panic attacks, anxiety, nervousness, and hallucinations.

If the children go off the medication, they can expect to suffer withdrawal symptoms, both physical and mental. Should they remain on the drugs for years, they are at high risk of becoming chronically depressed. They may also develop—as the American Psychiatric Association warns in one of its textbooks—an “apathy syndrome,” which “is characterized by a loss of motivation, increased passivity, and often feelings of lethargy and ‘flatness.’”57 There is also memory loss and cognitive decline to worry about, and, as we saw earlier, animal studies suggest that the drugs may cause serotonergic neurons to become swollen and misshapen.

First there was the ADHD explosion, and then came the news that childhood depression was rampant, and not long after that, in the late 1990s, juvenile bipolar disorder burst into public view. Newspapers and magazines ran features on this phenomenon, and once more psychiatry explained its appearance with a story of scientific discovery. “It has long been thought in the psychiatric community that children could not be given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder until the mid-to-late teens, and that mania in children was extremely rare,” wrote psychiatrist Demitri Papolos, in his bestselling book The Bipolar Child. “But scientists in the research vanguard are beginning to prove that the disorder can begin very early in life and that it is far more common than was previously supposed.”58 Yet the rise in the number of children and adolescents with this diagnosis was so astonishing—a fortyfold increase from 1995 to 2003—that Time, in an article titled “Young and Bipolar,” wondered if something else might be going on.59

But then, slowly but surely, such case reports began to appear. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, psychiatrists began prescribing Ritalin to hyperactive children, and suddenly, in 1976, Washington University’s Warren Weinberg, a pediatric neurologist, was writing in the American Journal of Diseases of Childhood that it was time for the field to realize that children could go manic. “Acceptance of the concept that mania occurs in children is important in order that affected children can be identified, the natural history defined, and appropriate treatment established and offered to these children,” he wrote.65

321

This was the moment in the medical literature that pediatric bipolar disorder was, in essence, “discovered.” In his article, Weinberg reviewed the case histories of five children suffering from this previously unrecognized illness, but he rushed past the fact that at least three of the five children had been treated with a tricyclic or Ritalin prior to becoming manic. Two years later, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital announced that they had identified nine children with manic-depressive illness, and they, too, skipped over the fact that seven of the nine had been previously treated with amphetamines, methylphenidate, or “other medications to affect behavior.”66

Then, in 1982, Michael Strober and Gabrielle Carlson at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute put a new twist into the juvenile bipolar story. Twelve of the sixty adolescents they had treated with antidepressants had turned “bipolar” over the course of three years, which—one might think—suggested that the drugs had caused the mania. Instead, Strober and Carlson reasoned that their study had shown that antidepressants could be used as a diagnostic tool. It wasn’t that antidepressants were causing some children to go manic, but rather the drugs were unmasking bipolar illness, as only children with the disease would suffer this reaction to an anti-depressant. “Our data imply that biologic differences between latent depressive subtypes are already present and detectable during the period of early adolescence, and that pharmacologic challenge can serve as one reliable aid in delimiting specific affective syndromes in juveniles,” they said.67

The “unmasking” of bipolar illness in children soon speeded up. The prescribing of Ritalin and antidepressants took off in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and as this occurred, the bipolar epidemic erupted. The number of hostile, aggressive, and out-of-control children admitted to psychiatric wards soared, and in 1995 Peter Lewinsohn from the Oregon Research Institute concluded that 1 percent of all American adolescents were now bipolar.68 Three years later, Carlson reported that 63 percent of the pediatric patients treated at her university hospital suffered from mania, the very symptom that doctors in the pre-psychopharmacologic era almost never saw in children. “Manic symptoms are the rule, rather than the exception,” she noted.69 Indeed, Lewinsohn’s epidemiological data was now already out of date. The number of children discharged from hospitals with a bipolar diagnosis rose fivefold between 1996 and 2004, such that this “ferocious mental illness” was now said to strike one in every fifty prepubertal children in America. “We don’t have the exact numbers yet,” University of Texas psychiatrist Robert Hirschfeld told Time in 2002, “except we know it’s there, and it’s underdiagnosed.”70

Even before the prescribing of Ritalin took hold, it was well known that amphetamines could stir psychotic and manic episodes. Indeed, amphetamines did this with such regularity that psychiatric researchers pointed to this effect as evidence supporting the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Amphetamines upped dopamine levels in the brain, suggesting that psychosis was caused by too much of this neurotransmitter. In 1974, David Janowsky, a physician at the University of California at San Diego School of Medicine, tested this hypothesis by giving three dopamine-elevating agents—d-amphetamine, l-amphetamine, and methylphenidate—to his schizophrenia patients. While all three drugs made them more psychotic, methylphenidate turned out to be tops in this regard, doubling the severity of their symptoms.71

323

Given this understanding of methylphenidate, psychiatry could expect that giving Ritalin to young children would cause many to suffer a manic or psychotic episode. Although this risk isn’t well quantified, Canadian psychiatrists reported in 1999 that nine of ninety-six ADHD children they treated with stimulants for an average of twenty-one months developed “psychotic symptoms.”72 In 2006, the FDA issued a report on this risk. From 2000 to 2005, the agency had received nearly one thousand reports of stimulant-induced psychosis and mania in children and adolescents, and given that these MedWatch reports are thought to represent only 1 percent of the actual number of adverse events, this suggests that 100,000 youths diagnosed with ADHD suffered psychotic and or manic episodes during that five-year period. The FDA determined that these episodes regularly occurred in “patients with no identifiable risk factors” for psychosis, meaning that they were clearly drug-induced, and that a “substantial portion” of the cases occurred in children ten years or less. “The predominance in young children of hallucinations, both visual and tactile, involving insects, snakes and worms is striking,” the FDA wrote.73

324

Once this drug-induced psychosis occurs, the children are usually diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Moreover, this diagnostic progression, from medicated ADHD to bipolar illness, is well recognized by experts in the field. In a study of 195 bipolar children and adolescents, Demitri Papolos found that 65 percent “had hypomanic, manic and aggressive reactions to stimulant medications.”74 In 2001, Melissa DelBello, at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, reported that twenty-one of thirty-four adolescent patients hospitalized for mania had been on stimulants “prior to the onset of an affective episode.” These drugs, she confessed, may “precipitate depression and/or mania in children who would not have otherwise developed bipolar disorder.”75

324

Yet there is an even bigger problem with stimulants. They cause children to cycle through arousal and dysphoric states on a daily basis. When a child takes the drug, dopamine levels in the synapse increase, and this produces an aroused state. The child may show increased energy, an intensified focus, and hyperalertness. The child may become anxious, irritable, aggressive, hostile, and unable to sleep. More extreme arousal symptoms include obsessive-compulsive and hypomanic behaviors. But when the drug exits the brain, dopamine levels in the synapse sharply drop, and this may lead to such dysphoric symptoms as fatigue, lethargy, apathy, social withdrawal, and depression.

324

Parents regularly talk of this daily “crash.” But—and this is the key—such arousal and dysphoric symptoms are the very symptoms that the National Institute of Mental Health identifies as characteristic of a bipolar child. Symptoms of mania in children, the NIMH says, include increased energy, intensified goal-directed activity, insomnia, irritability, agitation, and destructive out bursts. Symptoms of depression in children include loss of energy, social isolation, a loss of interest in activities (apathy), and a sad mood.

The ADHD to Bipolar Pathway

325

Stimulants used to treat ADHD induce both arousal and dysphoric symptoms. These drug-induced symptoms overlap to a remarkable degree the symptoms said to be characteristic of juvenile bipolar disorder.

325

In short, every child on a stimulant turns a bit bipolar, and the risk that a child diagnosed with ADHD will move on to a bipolar diagnosis after being treated with a stimulant has even been quantified. Joseph Biederman and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital reported in 1996 that 15 of 140 children (11 percent) diagnosed with ADHD developed bipolar symptoms—which were not present at initial diagnosis—within four years.76

325

This gives us our first mathematical equation for solving the juvenile bipolar epidemic: If a society prescribes stimulants to 3.5 million children and adolescents, as is the case in the United States today, it should expect that this practice will create 400,000 bipolar youth. As Time noted, most children with bipolar illness are diagnosed with a different psychiatric disorder first, with “ADHD the likeliest first call.”

325

Now let’s look at the SSRIs.

It is well established that antidepressants can induce manic episodes in adults, and naturally they have this effect on children, too. As early as 1992, when the prescribing of SSRIs to children was just getting started, University of Pittsburgh researchers reported that 23 percent of boys eight to nineteen years old treated with Prozac developed mania or maniclike symptoms, and another 19 percent developed “drug-induced” hostility.77 In Eli Lilly’s first study of Prozac for pediatric depression, 6 percent of the children treated with the drug suffered a manic episode; none in the placebo group did.78 Luvox, meanwhile, was reported to cause a 4 percent rate of mania in children under 18.79 In 2004, Yale University researchers assessed this risk of antidepressant-induced mania in young and old, and they found that it is highest in those under thirteen years of age.80

The incidence rates cited above are from short-term trials; the risk rises when children and teenagers stay on antidepressants for extended periods. In 1995, Harvard psychiatrists determined that 25 percent of children and adolescents diagnosed with depression convert to bipolar illness within two to four years. “Antidepressant treatment may well induce switching into mania, rapid cycling or affective instability in the young, as it almost certainly does in adults,” they explained.81 Washington University’s Barbara Geller extended the follow-up period to ten years, and in her study, nearly half of prepubertal children treated for depression ended up bipolar.82 These findings give us our second mathematical equation for solving the bipolar epidemic: If 2 million children and adolescents are treated with SSRIs for depression, this practice will create 500,000 to 1 million bipolar youth.

We now have numbers that tell of an iatrogenic epidemic: 400,000 bipolar children arriving via the ADHD doorway, and at least another half million through the antidepressant doorway.

327

Here are the results. In a 2003 study of seventy-nine juvenile bipolar patients, University of Louisville psychiatrist Rif El-Mallakh determined that forty-nine (62 percent) had been treated with a stimulant or an antidepressant prior to their becoming manic.83 That same year, Papolos reported that 83 percent of the 195 bipolar children he studied had been diagnosed with some other psychiatric illness first, and that two-thirds had been exposed to an antidepressant.84 Finally, Gianni Faedda found that 84 percent of the children treated for bipolar illness at the Luci Bini Mood Disorders Clinic in New York City between 1998 and 2000 had been previously exposed to psychiatric drugs. “Strikingly, in fewer than 10% [of the cases] was diagnosis of bipolar disorder considered initially,” Faedda wrote.85

As we saw earlier in this book, outcomes for adult bipolar patients have deteriorated dramatically in the past forty years, and the worst outcomes are seen in those with “mixed state” and “rapid cycling” symptoms. That clinical course in adults was virtually never seen prior to the psychopharmacology era, but rather it was one associated with exposure to antidepressants, and, tragically, those are the very symptoms that afflict the overwhelming majority of juvenile bipolar patients. They exhibit symptoms “similar to the clinical picture reported for severely ill, treatment-resistant adults,” explained Barbara Geller in 1997.89

Thus, this is not just a story of children turned bipolar; it’s a story of children afflicted with a particularly severe form of it. Papolos found that 87 percent of his 195 juvenile bipolar patients suffered from “ultra, ultra rapid cycling,” which meant that they were constantly switching between manic and depressed mood states.90 Similarly, Faedda determined that 66 percent of the juvenile bipolar patients treated at the Luci Bini Mood Disorders Clinic were “ultra, ultra rapid-cyclers,” and another 19 percent suffered from rapid cycling only a little bit less extreme. “In contrast to a biphasic, episodic and relatively slow cycling course in some adults with bipolar disorder, pediatric forms usually involve mixed mood states and a sub-chronic, unstable, and unremitting course,” Faedda wrote.91

Outcome studies have found that the long-term prognosis for these children is grim. The NIMH, as part of its STEP-BD study, charted the outcomes of 542 children and adolescent bipolar patients, and it reported that pre-adult onset “was associated with greater rates of comorbid anxiety disorders and substance abuse, more recurrences, shorter periods of euthymia [normal mood], and greater likelihood of suicide attempts and violence.”92 Boris Birmaher, at the University of Pittsburgh, determined that “early onset” bipolar patients are symptomatic about 60 percent of the time, and that, on average, they shift “polarity”—from depression to mania or vice versa—an astonishing sixteen times a year. The prepubertal patients were “two times less likely than those with postpubertal onset bipolar to recover,” he said, and it was “expected that children will be poor responders to treatment when they become adults.”93 DelBello followed a group of adolescents hospitalized for a first bipolar episode and concluded that only 41 percent functionally recovered within a year.94 This impairment, Birmaher determined, then worsens after the first year. “Functional impairment in bipolar appears to increase during adolescence regardless of age of onset.”95

Youth diagnosed with bipolar illness are typically put on drug cocktails that include an atypical antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. This means that they now have multiple neurotransmitter pathways in their brains that are being mucked up, and naturally, this treatment does not lead them back to emotional and physical health. In 2002, DelBello reported that lithium, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers all failed to help bipolar youth fare better at the end of two years. Those who were treated with a neuroleptic, she added, “were significantly less likely to recover than those who did not receive a neuroleptic.”96 Six years later, Hayes, Inc., a Pennsylvania consulting firm that conducts “unbiased” assessments of drugs for health-care providers, concluded that there was no good scientific evidence that the mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics prescribed for pediatric bipolar were either safe or effective. “Our findings indicate that at this time, anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics cannot be recommended for children diagnosed with bipolar disorders,” said Elisabeth Houtsmuller, senior analyst for Hayes.97 These reports attest to a lack of drug efficacy, but as Houtsmuller noted, the side effects from these “pharmacological treatments” are “alarming.” In particular, atypical antipsychotics may cause metabolic dysfunction, hormonal abnormalities, diabetes, obesity, emotional blunting, and tardive dyskinesia.* Eventually, the drugs will induce cognitive decline, and the child who stays on the cocktails into adulthood can expect to die early as well.

There are no good studies yet on the percentage of “early onset” bipolar patients who, when they reach adulthood, end up on the SSI and SSDI disability rolls. However, the astonishing jump in the number of “severely mentally ill” children receiving SSI speaks volumes about the havoc that is being wreaked. There were 16,200 psychiatrically disabled youth under eighteen years old on the SSI rolls in 1987, and they comprised less than 6 percent of the total number of disabled children. Twenty years later, there were 561,569 disabled mentally ill children on the SSI rolls, and they comprised 50 percent of the total.

334

This epidemic is even hitting preschool children. The prescribing of psychotropic drugs to two-year-olds and three-year-olds began to become more commonplace about a decade ago, and sure enough, the number of severely mentally ill children under six years of age receiving SSI has tripled since then, rising from 22,453 in 2000 to 65,928 in 2007.98

335

Moreover, the SSI numbers only begin to hint at the scope of the harm being done. Everywhere there is evidence of a worsening of the mental health of children and teenagers. From 1995 to 1999, psychiatric-related emergency room visits by children increased 59 percent.99 The deteriorating mental health of the nation’s children, declared U.S. surgeon general David Satcher in 2001, constituted “a health crisis.”100 Next, colleges were suddenly wondering why so many of their students were suffering manic episodes or behaving in disturbed ways; a 2007 survey discovered that one in six college students had deliberately “cut or burned self” in the prior year.101 All of this led the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate what was going on, and it reported in 2008 that one in every fifteen young adults, eighteen to twenty-six years old, is now “seriously mentally ill.” There are 680,000 in that age group with bipolar disorder and another 800,000 ill with major depression, and, the GAO noted, this was in fact an undercount of the problem, as it didn’t include young adults who were homeless, incarcerated, or institutionalized. All of these youth are “functionally impaired” to some degree, the GAO said.102

428

when we view the psychopharmacology “revolution” through this prism, as a business enterprise first and a medical enterprise second, we can easily see why psychiatry and the pharmaceutical companies tell the stories they do, and why the studies detailing poor long-term outcomes have been kept from the public. That information would derail a business enterprise that brings profits to so many.

428

As we saw earlier, during the late 1970s psychiatry was worried about its survival. The public viewed its therapies as “low in efficacy,” and sales of psychiatric drugs were in decline. Then, in what might be called a “rebranding” effort, psychiatry published DSM-III and began telling the public that mental disorders were “real” diseases, just like diabetes and cancer, and that their drugs were chemical antidotes to those diseases, just like “insulin for diabetes.” That story, while it may have been false in kind, created a powerful conceptual framework for selling psychiatric medications of all types. Everyone could understand the chemical-imbalance metaphor, and once the public came to understand that notion, it became relatively simple for pharmaceutical companies and their storytelling allies to build markets for psychiatric drugs of various types. They ran “educational” campaigns to make the public more “aware” of the various disorders the drugs were approved to treat, and, at the same time, they expanded the diagnostic boundaries of mental disorders.

429

After Prozac was introduced, NIMH’s DART campaign informed the public that depression regularly went “undiagnosed and untreated.” Upjohn partnered with the APA to tell the public that “panic disorder” was a common affliction. In 1990, the NIMH launched its “Decade of the Brain,” telling the public that 20 percent of Americans suffered from mental disorders (and thus might be in need of psychiatric medications). Soon psychiatric groups and others were promoting “screening programs,” which from a business perspective are best described as customer-recruitment efforts. NAMI, for its part, understood that its “educational” efforts served a commercial end, writing in a 2000 document filed with the government that “providers, health plans, and pharmaceutical companies want to grow their markets and to increase their share of the market…. NAMI will cooperate with these entities to grow the market by making persons aware of the issues involving severe brain disorders.”2

527

2. NAMI IRS 990 Form, 2000.

429

The APA is in charge of defining diagnostic categories in our society, and DSM-IV, an 886-page tome published in 1994, listed 297 disorders, 32 more than DSM-III. New and expanded diagnoses invite more people into the psychiatric drugstore, and one of the best examples of this type of market-building occurred in 1998, when GlaxoSmithKline got the FDA to approve Paxil for “social anxiety disorder.” In the past, this might have been perceived as a character trait (shyness), but GlaxoSmithKline hired a PR firm, Cohn & Wolfe, to promote awareness of this newly recognized “disease,” and soon newspapers and television shows were telling of how SAD afflicted 13 percent of the American population, making it “the third most common psychiatric disorder in the United States, after depression and alcoholism.” Those afflicted with this illness, the public learned, were in some ways biologically “allergic to people.”3

430

Diagnostic changes lay behind the bipolar boom, too. In DSM-III (1980), bipolar illness was identified for the first time (the old manic-depressive cohort was splintered into different groups), and then psychiatry steadily loosened the diagnostic boundaries for this illness, such that today the field talks about bipolar I, bipolar II, and a “bipolarity intermediate between bipolar disorder and normality.” This once rare disease is now said to afflict 1 to 2 percent of the adult population, and if the “intermediate” bipolar folk are counted, 6 percent. As this diagnostic expansion happened, pharmaceutical companies and their allies mounted their usual “educational” campaigns. Abbott Laboratories and NAMI teamed up to promote a “Bipolar Awareness Day;” in 2002, Eli Lilly joined with the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance to launch a new online destination, bipolarawareness.com. Today many websites offer visitors a quick question-and-answer test to see if they have this illness.

431

Naturally, pharmaceutical companies want to sell their drugs to people of all ages, and they built the pediatric market for psychotropics step by step. First, in the 1980s, the prescribing of stimulants to “hyperactive” children took off. Next, in the early 1990s, psychiatrists began regularly prescribing SSRIs to teenagers. But that meant prepubertal children weren’t being prescribed these new wonder drugs, and in 1997, the Wall Street Journal reported that the manufacturers of SSRIs were “taking aim at a controversial new market: children.” The drug firms were “preparing their medications in easy-to-swallow forms that will be more palatable to even the youngest tykes,” the newspaper said, with Eli Lilly formulating a “minty liquid” Prozac for the tots to down.4 The New York Times, in its coverage of this initiative, explained quite clearly what was driving it: “The adult market for [SSRIs] has become saturated…. The companies are looking for expanded markets.”5 Psychiatry quickly provided a medical cover for this marketing effort, with the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry announcing that 5 percent of all children in the United States were clinically depressed. “Many of these young patients now are inadequately treated, experts say, often leading to long-term emotional and behavioral problems, drug abuse, or even suicide,” the Wall Street Journal reported.6

432

The creation of the “juvenile bipolar” market was a bit more complicated. Prior to the 1990s, psychiatry thought that bipolar illness simply didn’t occur in prepubertal children, or was extremely rare. But children and teenagers prescribed stimulants and antidepressants often suffered manic episodes, and thus pediatricians and psychiatrists began to see more youth with “bipolar” symptoms. At the same time, once Janssen and Eli Lilly brought their atypical antipsychotics to market, they were looking for a way to sell those drugs to children, and during the mid-1990s, Joseph Biederman at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston provided the diagnostic framework that made that possible. In 2009, while being deposed in a legal case, he explained his handiwork.

All psychiatric diagnoses, he said, “are subjective in children and in adults.” As such, he and his colleagues decided that children who in the past had been seen as having pronounced behavioral problems should instead be diagnosed with juvenile bipolar illness. “The conditions that we see in front of us are reconceptualized,” Biederman testified. “These children have been called in the past conduct disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder. It’s not that these children did not exist, they were just under different names.”7 Biederman and his colleagues decided that “severe irritability” or “affective storms” would be the telltale signs of juvenile bipolar disorder, and with this new diagnostic criteria in hand, they announced in 1996 that many children diagnosed with ADHD were in fact “bipolar” or else “comorbid” for both illnesses.8 The illness was a “much more common condition than was previously thought,” often appearing when children were only four or five years old, Biederman said.* 9 Soon parents in the United States were reading newspaper articles about this newly recognized illness and buying The Bipolar Child, a book published by Random House in 2000. Child psychiatrists, meanwhile, began treating it with atypical antipsychotics.

433

That was the marketing machinery that lured more and more Americans into the psychiatric drugstore. As new drugs were brought to market, disease “awareness” campaigns were conducted and diagnostic categories were expanded. Now, once a business gets a customer into its store, it wants to keep that customer and get that customer to buy multiple products, and that’s when the psychiatric “drug trap” kicks in.

433

The “broken brain” story helps with customer retention, of course, for if a person suffers a “chemical imbalance,” then it makes sense that he or she will have to take the medication to correct it indefinitely, like “insulin for diabetes.” But more important, the drugs create chemical imbalances in the brain, and this helps turn a first-time customer into a long-term user, and often into a buyer of multiple drugs. The patient’s brain adapts to the first drug, and that makes it difficult to go off the medication. The store’s exit door is hard to squeeze through, so to speak. At the same time, since psychiatric drugs perturb normal function, they regularly cause physical and psychiatric problems, and this greases the path to polypharmacy. The hyperactive child is put on a stimulant that rouses him during the day; at night he needs a sleeping pill to go to sleep. An atypical causes people to feel depressed and lethargic; psychiatrists may prescribe an antidepressant to treat that problem. Conversely, an antidepressant may stir a bout of mania; in that case an atypical antipsychotic may be prescribed to tamp down the mania. The first drug triggers a need for a second, and so on.

Eli Lilly even capitalized on this fact when it brought Zyprexa to market. As it well knew, Prozac and other SSRIs could trigger manic episodes, and so it instructed its sales representatives to tell psychiatrists that Zyprexa “is a great mood stabilizer, especially for patients whose symptoms were aggravated by an SSRI.”10 In essence, Eli Lilly was telling doctors to prescribe its second drug to fix the psychiatric problems caused by its first one. We can also see this cascading effect operating at a societal level. The SSRIs came to market and suddenly bipolar patients were cropping up everywhere, and then this new group of patients provided a market for the atypicals.*

434

All of this has produced a growth industry of impressive dimensions. In 1985, outpatient sales of antidepressants and antipsychotics in the United States amounted to $503 million.11 Twenty-three years later, U.S. sales of antidepressants and anti psychotics reached $24.2 billion, nearly a fiftyfold increase. Anti psychotics—a class of drugs previously seen as extremely problematic in kind, useful only in severely ill patients—were the top revenue-producing class of drugs in 2008, ahead even of the cholesterol-lowering agents.12 Total sales of all psychotropic drugs in 2008 topped $40 billion. Today—and this shows how crowded the drugstore has become—one in every eight Americans takes a psychiatric drug on a regular basis.13

According to a 2009 report by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, spending on mental health services is now rising at a faster rate than for any other medical category.29 In 2008, the United States spent about $170 billion on mental health services, which is twice the amount it spent in 2001, and this spending is projected to increase to $280 billion in 2015. The public, primarily through its Medicaid and Medicare programs, picks up close to 60 percent of the nation’s spending on mental health services.30

The Story That Was … and Wasn’t Told

Silencing Dissent

526

77. Interview with Peter Breggin, October 10, 2008.

413

it grossly exaggerated the merits of the second-generation psycho tropics. In order to keep that tale of scientific progress afloat (and to protect its own belief in that tale), it has needed to squelch talk about the harm that the drugs can cause.

414

Psychiatry’s policing of its own ranks began in earnest in the late 1970s, when Loren Mosher was ousted from the NIMH for having run his Soteria experiment. The next prominent psychiatrist to end up on psychiatry’s hit list was Peter Breggin. Although he is known today for his “antipsychiatry” writings, he, too, had once been on the fast track at the NIMH. After finishing his residency at a Harvard Medical School hospital, Breggin went to the NIMH in 1966 to work on developing community mental health centers. “I was still the young hotshot guy,” he recalled, in an interview. “I thought I would be the youngest professor of psychiatry in the history of Harvard Medical School. That was the trajectory I was on.”77

414

However, he saw that the future belonged to biological psychiatry, as opposed to the social psychiatry that interested him, and he left the NIMH to go into private practice. Soon he began writing about the hazards of electroshock and psychiatric drugs, which, he argued, “worked” by disabling the brain. After a number of heated battles with the APA’s leaders, Breggin appeared in 1987 on Oprah Winfrey’s television show, where he spoke about tardive dyskinesia and how that dysfunction was evidence that neuroleptics damaged the brain. His comments so infuriated the APA that it sent a transcript of the show to NAMI, which in turn filed a complaint with the Maryland State Commission on Medical Discipline, asking that it take away Breggin’s medical license on the grounds that his statements had caused schizophrenia patients to stop taking their medications (and thus caused harm). Although the commission decided not to take any action, it did conduct an inquiry (rather than summarily dismissing NAMI’s complaint), and the message to everyone in the field was, once again, quite clear.

415

“I think the interesting thing is that Loren [Mosher] and I took on scientifically the two sides of the issue,” Breggin said. “Loren took on the issue that there is a better treatment than drugs for schizophrenia. I took on the treatments—the drugs, electroshock, and psychosurgery. And what this showed is that it didn’t matter which end you wanted to take, they were willing to destroy your career. That is the lesson.”

415

The career setback that Irish psychiatrist David Healy experienced was, in some ways, reminiscent of Mosher’s fall from grace. During the 1990s, he earned a reputation as one of the field’s leading historians, his writings focusing on the psychopharmacology era. He had served as secretary of the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and in early 2000, he accepted an offer from the University of Toronto’s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health to head up its mood and anxiety program. Up until that moment, he was very much part of the psychiatric establishment, just as Mosher had been.

415

However, for several years he had been interested in the question of whether SSRIs could stir suicide, and he had recently completed a “healthy volunteers” study. Two of the twenty volunteers had become suicidal after they were exposed to an SSRI, which clearly showed that the drug could cause such thoughts. Not long after he accepted the Toronto job, he presented his results at a meeting of the British Association for Psychopharmacology. There, one of the most prominent figures in American psychiatry warned him to knock it off. “He told me that my career would be destroyed if I kept on showing results like the ones I’d just shown, that I had no right to bring out hazards of the pills like these,” Healy said.78

526

78. Healy interview on CBS News and Current Affairs, June 12, 2001.

416

In November of 2000, only a few months before he was scheduled to start his new job at the University of Toronto, Healy gave a talk on the history of psychopharmacology at a colloquium organized by the school. In his presentation, Healy spoke about problems that had arisen with neuroleptics since their introduction in the 1950s, briefly reviewed the data showing that Prozac and other SSRIs elevated the risk of suicide, and then observed in passing that outcomes for affective disorders are worse today than they were a century ago. This, he observed, shouldn’t be happening if “our drugs really worked.”79

416

Although the audience subsequently rated his talk as the colloquium’s best for content, by the time Healy arrived back in Wales, the University of Toronto had rescinded the job offer. “While you are held in high regard as a scholar of the history of modern psychiatry, we do not feel your approach is compatible with the goals for development of the academic and clinical resources that we have,” wrote the Centre’s head psychiatrist, David Goldbloom, in an e-mail.80 Once more, others in the field could draw only one lesson. “The message is that it is a bad idea to speak out, and that the idea that treatments might not work or might not be best managed by being entrusted to doctors is beyond the pale,” Healy said in an interview.81

417

Numerous others can attest to the fact that it is a “bad idea” to speak out. Nadine Lambert, a psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley, conducted a long-term study of children treated with Ritalin and found that, as young adults, they had elevated rates of cocaine abuse and cigarette smoking. After she reported her results at a 1998 NIH conference, the National Institute on Drug Abuse stopped funding her work.

417

In 2000, when Joseph Glenmullen, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, authored Prozac Backlash, which detailed the many problems associated with the use of SSRIs, Eli Lilly mounted a campaign to discredit him. A public-relations firm gathered critical comments from several prominent psychiatrists, who derided Glenmullen as a “nobody” in the field, and then it mailed these “reviews” to various newspapers. “It’s a dishonest book, it’s manipulative, it’s mischievous,” said Harvard Medical School psychiatrist Jerrold Rosenbaum, even though he was a colleague of Glenmullen’s. The press release naturally did not mention that Rosenbaum was an Eli Lilly consultant.82

526

82. Memo from Larry Carpman to Steve Kurkjian, April 11, 2000.

417

Next up on the chopping block: Gretchen LeFever, a psychologist at East Virginia Medical School. After she published research showing that an overly high number of children in Virginia schools were being diagnosed with ADHD, an anonymous “whistle-blower” charged her with scientific misconduct. Her federal research funds were cut off and her computers were seized, and while she was subsequently cleared of any misconduct, her career had still been derailed.

Said Healy: “The thought-control aspect of things in psychiatry today is like old-style Eastern European social control.”

418

The third aspect to the storytelling process that has led to our societal delusion about the merits of psychiatric drugs is easy to document. Imagine what our beliefs would be today if, over the past twenty years, we had opened our newspapers and read about the following findings, which represent but a sampling of the outcome studies we reviewed earlier in the book:

418

1990: In a large, national depression study, the eighteen-month stay-well rate was highest for those treated with psychotherapy (30 percent) and lowest for those treated with an antidepressant (19 percent). (NIMH)

1992: Schizophrenia outcomes are much better in poor countries like India and Nigeria, where only 16 percent of patients are regularly maintained on antipsychotics, than in the United States and other rich countries, where continual drug usage is the standard of care. (World Health Organization)

1995: In a six-year study of 547 depressed patients, those who were treated for the disorder were nearly seven times more likely to become incapacitated than those who weren’t, and three times more likely to suffer a “cessation” of their “principal social role.” (NIMH)

1998: Antipsychotic drugs cause morphological changes in the brain that are associated with a worsening of schizophrenia symptoms. (University of Pennsylvania)

1998: In a World Health Organization study of the merits of screening for depression, those diagnosed and treated with psychiatric medications fared worse—in terms of their depressive symptoms and their general health—over a one-year period than those who weren’t exposed to the drugs. (WHO)

1999: When long-term benzodiazepine users withdraw from the drugs, they become “more alert, more relaxed, and less anxious.” (University of Pennsylvania)

2000: Epidemiological studies show that long-term outcomes for bipolar patients today are dramatically worse than they were in the pre-drug era, with this deterioration in modern outcomes likely due to the harmful effects of antidepressants and antipsychotics. (Eli Lilly; Harvard Medical School)

2001: In a study of 1,281 Canadians who went on short-term disability for depression, 19 percent of those who took an antidepressant ended up on long-term disability, versus 9 percent of those who didn’t take the medication. (Canadian investigators)

2001: In the pre-drug era, bipolar patients did not suffer cognitive decline over the long term, but today they end up almost as cognitively impaired as schizophrenia patients. (Sheppard Pratt Health System in Baltimore)

2004: Long-term benzodiazepine users suffer cognitive deficits “moderate to large” in magnitude. (Australian scientists)

2005: Angel dust, amphetamines, and other drugs that induce psychosis all increase D2 HIGH receptors in the brain; antipsychotics cause this same change in the brain. (University of Toronto)

2005: In a five-year study of 9,508 depressed patients, those who took an antidepressant were, on average, symptomatic nineteen weeks a year, versus eleven weeks for those who didn’t take any medication. (University of Calgary)

2007: In a fifteen-year study, 40 percent of schizophrenia patients off antipsychotics recovered, versus 5 percent of the medicated patients. (University of Illinois)

2007: Long-term users of benzodiazepines end up “markedly ill to extremely ill” and regularly suffer from symptoms of depression and anxiety. (French scientists)

2007: In a large study of children diagnosed with ADHD, by the end of the third year “medication use was a significant marker not of beneficial outcome, but of deterioration.” The medicated children were also more likely to engage in delinquent behavior; they ended up slightly shorter, too. (NIMH)

2008: In a national study of bipolar patients, the major predictor of a poor outcome was exposure to an antidepressant. Those who took an antidepressant were nearly four times as likely to become rapid cyclers, which is associated with poor long-term outcome. (NIMH)

420

A check of newspaper archives reveals that the psychiatric establishment has thoroughly succeeded in keeping this information from the public. I searched for accounts of these studies in the New York Times archives and in the LexisNexis database, which covers most U.S. newspapers, and I couldn’t find a single instance where the results were accurately reported.*

424

* There were newspaper reviews of my book Mad in America that mentioned the WHO study of better schizophrenia outcomes in poor countries where patients were not regularly maintained on the drugs, and since then, this information has become somewhat known. In addition, I mentioned Martin Harrow’s fifteen-year schizophrenia study in a talk I gave at Holy Cross College in February 2009, and that led to a February 8, 2009, article in the Worcester Telegram and Gazette (Mass.) that discussed Harrow’s work. That was the first time that news of his study had appeared in any American newspaper.

420

Newspapers, of course, would have been happy to publish these study results. However, medical news is typically generated in this way: The scientific journals, the NIH, medical schools, and pharmaceutical companies issue press releases touting certain findings as important, and reporters then sift through the releases to identify the ones they deem worthy of writing about. If no press releases are issued, or there is no other effort by the medical community to publicize the findings, then no stories appear.

420

We can even document this blackout process at work in the NIMH’s handling of Martin Harrow’s outcomes study. In 2007, the year he published his results in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, the NIMH issued eighty-nine press releases, many on inconsequential matters. But it did not issue one on Harrow’s findings, even though his was arguably the best study of the long-term outcomes of schizophrenia patients that had ever been done in the United States.83 It’s fair to say that if the results had been the reverse, the NIMH would have sounded the press-release gong and newspapers across the country would have touted the findings.

526

421

Although reports about most of the studies listed above simply never appeared in newspapers, there were a couple of instances when psychiatrists were forced to say something to reporters about one of the studies, and each time they spun the results. For example, when the NIMH announced the three-year results from its MTA study of ADHD treatments, it did not inform the public that stimulant usage during the third year was a “marker of deterioration.” Instead, it put out a press release with this headline: IMPROVEMENT FOLLOWING ADHD TREATMENT SUSTAINED FOR MOST CHILDREN. That headline told of drugs that had been beneficial, and while the text of the release did state that “continuing medication was no longer associated with better outcomes by the third year,” it also included a canned quote from lead author Peter Jensen stating that there was still plenty of reason to keep children on Ritalin. “Our results suggest that medication can make a long-term difference for some children if it’s continued with optimal intensity, and not started or added too late in a child’s clinical course.”84

526

84. NIMH press release, July 20, 2007.

421

If we want to get another look at this spinning process, we can turn to a 1998 New York Times article that briefly told of the WHO study on schizophrenia outcomes in rich and poor countries. After interviewing psychiatrists about the study, the Times reporter wrote that “schizophrenics generally responded better to treatment in less developed countries than in more technologically developed countries.”85 Responded better to treatment—readers could only assume that schizophrenia patients in India and Nigeria responded better to antipsychotics than patients in the United States and other rich countries did. They had no way to know that “treatment” for 84 percent of the schizophrenia patients in the poor countries consisted of being off the drugs.

526

85. J. Sharkey, “Delusions; paranoia is universal,” New York Times, August 2, 1998.

422

In July 2009, I also searched the NIMH and NAMI websites for some mention of the studies listed above, and I found zilch. For instance, the NIMH website did not discuss the remarkable decline in bipolar outcomes in modern times, even though Carlos Zarate, who coauthored the 2000 article that documented this decline, was head of the NIMH’s mood and anxiety disorders research unit in 2009.

422

Similarly, NAMI’s website didn’t provide any information about Harrow’s study, even though it provides reason for parents of schizophrenic children to be optimistic. Forty percent of those off medications recovered over the long term! But that finding directly contradicted the message that NAMI has promoted to the public for decades, and NAMI’s website is sticking to that message. Antipsychotics, it informs the public, “correct an imbalance in the chemicals that enable brain cells to communicate with each other.”86

526

86. Search of NAMI website on July 7, 2009.

423

Finally, the entire outcomes history documented in this book is missing from the 2008 edition of the APA’s Textbook of Psychiatry, which means that medical students training to be psychiatrists are kept in the dark about this history.87 The book does not discuss “supersensitivity psychosis.” It does not mention that antidepressants may be depressogenic agents over the long term. It does not report that bipolar outcomes are much worse today than they were forty years ago. There is no discussion of rising disability rates. There is no talk about the cognitive impairment that is seen in longtime users of psychotropic drugs.

526

87. R. Hales, The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Psychiatry (Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing, 2008).

423

The textbook authors are clearly familiar with many of the sixteen studies listed above, but, if they do mention them, they don’t discuss the relevant facts about medication usage. The long-running study by Harrow, the textbook states, reveals that there are some schizophrenia patients who “are able to function without the benefit of continuous antipsychotic treatment.” The authors of that sentence didn’t mention the stunning difference in recovery rates for the unmedicated and medicated groups; instead they crafted a sentence that told of the benefit of continuous antipsychotic treatment.

423

In a similar vein, while the textbook briefly discusses the WHO study on the better outcomes of schizophrenia patients in poor countries like India and Nigeria, it does not mention that patients in those countries weren’t regularly maintained on antipsychotics. In a section on benzodiazepines, the authors acknowledge that there are concerns about their addictive properties, but then state that long-term outcomes for those who stay on benzodiazepines are generally good, as most patients “maintain their therapeutic gains.”

385

Today, the fraudulent nature of the story told by Eli Lilly and psychiatry about Prozac when it came to market is fairly well known, having been documented by Peter Breggin, David Healy, and Joseph Glenmullen, among others. Breggin and Healy wrote their accounts after gaining access to Eli Lilly files while serving as expert witnesses in civil lawsuits, which allowed them to see data and internal memorandums that belied what the public had been told about the drug.

385

At the risk of going over familiar ground, we need to revisit that story briefly, for it will help us see, with considerable clarity, how our societal delusions about the merits of the “second-generation” psychiatric drugs were formed. Eli Lilly’s marketing of Prozac proved to be a model that other companies followed as they brought their drugs to market, and it involved telling a false story in the scientific literature, hyping that story even more to the media, and hiding risks that could lead to disability and death for those who used the drugs.

386

Drug development begins in the laboratory, with investigation into a drug’s “mechanism of action,” and as we learned earlier, Eli Lilly scientists determind in the mid-1970s that fluoxetine caused serotonin to “pile up” in the synapse, which in turn triggered a series of physiological changes in the brain. Next, in animal studies, the drug was found to cause stereotyped activity in rats (repetitious sniffing, licking, etc.) and aggressive behavior in cats and dogs.3

386

In 1977, Eli conducted its first small trial in humans, but “none of the eight patients who completed the four-week treatment showed distinct drug-induced improvement,” Eli Lilly’s Ray Fuller told his colleagues in 1978. The drug also had caused “a fairly large number of reports of adverse reactions.” One patient had gone psychotic on the drug, and others had suffered from “akathisia and restlessness,” Fuller said.4

523

386

The trials of fluoxetine had barely begun and it was clear that Eli Lilly had a big problem. Fluoxetine didn’t appear to lift depression and it caused a side effect—akathisia—known to increase the risk of suicide and violence. After more reports of this kind came in, Eli Lilly amended its trial protocols. “In future studies, the use of benzodiazepines to control the agitation will be permitted,” Fuller wrote on July 23, 1979.5 The benzodiazepines would help suppress reports of akathisia, and likely boost efficacy results, as several trials of benzodiazepines for depression had shown them to be as effective as a tricyclic.

523

5. “Fluoxetine project team meeting,” July 23, 1979, accessed at healyprozac.com.

386

Of course, as Eli Lilly’s Dorothy Dobbs later confessed in court, the use of benzodiazepines was “scientifically bad,” as it would “confound the results” and “interfere with the analysis of both safety and efficacy,” but it enabled the company to continue development of fluoxetine.6

523

6. J. Cornwell, The Power to Harm (New York: Viking, 1996), 147–48.

387

Still, even with addition of the benzodiazepines, fluoxetine failed to perform well. During the early 1980s, the company conducted a phase III trial of the drug in Germany, and in 1985, the German licensing authority, Bundesgesundheitsamt (BGA), concluded that this drug was “totally unsuitable for the treatment of depression.”7 According to the patients’ “self ratings” (as opposed to the doctors’ ratings), the drug produced “little response or no improvement in the clinical picture of the patients,” the BGA noted.8 At the same time, it had caused psychosis and hallucinations, and increased some patients’ anxiety, agitation, and insomnia, “which as adverse effects exceed those which are considered acceptable by medical standards,” the BGA wrote.9 Most problematic of all, this drug treatment could prove fatal. “Sixteen suicide attempts were made, two of these with success,” the BGA said.10 A German Eli Lilly employee privately calculated that the incidence rate of suicidal acts for the fluoxetine patients was “5.6 times higher than under the other active medication, imipramine.”11

387

With Germany having rejected its application, Eli Lilly naturally worried that it would be unable to gain FDA approval for fluoxetine.* It needed to hide the suicide data, and in a 1994 civil lawsuit, Nancy Lord, an expert in clinical trial design, explained how the company did it. First, Eli Lilly instructed investigators to record various drug-related adverse events as “symptoms of depression.” As such, in the trial results submitted to the FDA, the problems were attributed to the disease rather than to fluoxetine. Second, when Eli Lilly scientists tabulated the data from case report forms, they changed individual reports of “suicidal ideation” to “depression.” Third, Lilly employees went through the German data “and pulled out [suicide] cases that they didn’t think were suicide.”12

523

12. Cornwell, The Power to Harm, 198.

388

All of these shenanigans, Lord told a court in 1994, made the entire testing process scientifically “worthless.” Yet even with these statistical manipulations, Eli Lilly still struggled to present a convincing case for fluoxetine in its application to the FDA. It had conducted placebo-controlled trials at eight sites, and in four of them, the fluoxetine patients had fared no better than the placebo group, and in the others, fluoxetine was only slightly better than a placebo.13 Meanwhile, when Peter Breggin reviewed Lilly’s documents, he discovered that imipramine had proven to be more effective than fluoxetine in six of seven trials.14 The FDA, in its March 28, 1985, review of one large trial, made the same observation: “Imipramine was clearly more effective than placebo, whereas fluoxetine was less consistently better than placebo.”15

388

At best, fluoxetine’s efficacy was of a very marginal sort, and FDA reviewer Richard Kapit also worried about its safety. At least thirty-nine patients treated with fluoxetine had gone psychotic in the short trials, and slightly more than 1 percent had become manic or hypomanic. Other side effects included insomnia, nervousness, confusion, dizziness, memory dysfunction, tremors, and impaired motor coordination. Fluoxetine, Kapit concluded, “may negatively affect patients with depression.”16 The FDA also understood that Eli Lilly had tried to hide many of these problems, the company having engaged in “large-scale underreporting” of the harm that fluoxetine could cause, according to reviewer David Graham.17

389

While the trials may have been scientifically worthless, they nevertheless proved to be an accurate forecast of what happened after Prozac was brought to market. There were numerous anecdotal accounts of Prozac-treated patients committing horrendous crimes or killing themselves, and so many adverse-events reports flowed into the FDA’s MedWatch program that Prozac quickly became America’s most complained about drug.

389

By the summer of 1997, the FDA had received thirty-nine thousand such reports about Prozac, far outstripping the number received by any other drug for that nine-year period (1988–1997). The MedWatch filings told of hundreds of suicides, and of a long list of vexing side effects, which included psychotic depression, mania, abnormal thinking, hallucinations, hostility, confusion, amnesia, convulsions, tremors, and sexual dysfunction.18 The FDA estimates that only 1 percent of all adverse events are reported to MedWatch, which suggests that roughly 4 million Americans during that nine-year period had a bad or even fatal reaction to Prozac.19

389

Obviously, the record chalked up by fluoxetine in the clinical trials was not one that would support a successful launch in the marketplace. The public was not likely to embrace a medication that German’s licensing authority, in its initial review, had deemed “totally unsuitable” as a treatment for depression. If Prozac was going to be successful, the psychiatrists that Eli Lilly had paid to run the trials needed to tell a very different story in the medical journals and to the public.

390

The first account of a U.S. trial of fluoxetine appeared in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in 1984. This novel agent, wrote James Bremner, from Northwest Psychopharmacology Research in Washington, “provides effective antidepressant activity with fewer and less troublesome side effects than imipramine…. None of the adverse events reported by fluoxetine patients were considered to be drug related.” Fluoxetine, he added, “proved more effective than the tricyclic antidepressant.”20 Next, John Feigner, from the University of California at San Diego, reported that fluoxetine was at least equal in efficacy to imipramine (and probably superior to the tri-cyclic) and that “no serious side effects were observed” in his twenty-two fluoxetine patients during a five-week study.21

390

A theme had been sounded—a very safe and improved antidepressant had been developed—and Eli Lilly’s investigators stuck to it in the years that followed. “Fluoxetine was better tolerated than imipramine,” California psychiatrist Jay Cohn reported in 1985.22 “This drug,” said Eli Lilly’s Joachim Wernicke, in another article in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, “has very few serious side effects.”23 Finally, in the 1985 report on its large phase III trial, Eli Lilly announced that “fluoxetine produced greater improvement than placebo on all major efficacy parameters.”24

391

While these reports did tell of a new drug that was superior to the old class of antidepressants, this still was not a narrative of a “breakthrough” medication. There was no sense of why this drug worked better, but as FDA approval for fluoxetine neared, a new “fact” began to appear in the scientific reports. In a 1987 article in the British Journal of Psychiatry, Sidney Levine wrote that “studies have shown that [serotonin] deficiency plays an important role in the psychobiology of depressive illness.”25 While this was not what had actually been found—Levine had apparently missed the 1984 NIMH report that “elevations or decrements in the functioning of serotonergic systems per se are not likely to be associated with depression”—this article set the stage for fluoxetine to be touted as a drug that fixed a chemical imbalance.

Two years later, University of Louisville psychiatrists surveyed the fluoxetine literature in order to provide “prescribing guidelines for the newest antidepressant,” and they wrote that “depressed patients have lower than normal concentrations of [serotonin metabolites] in their cerebrospinal fluid.” A delusional belief was now spreading through the medical literature, and perhaps not surprisingly, the Kentucky psychiatrists concluded that fluoxetine, which theoretically raised serotonin levels, was “an ideal drug for the treatment of depression.”26

This trail of reports in medical journals provided Eli Lilly with the sound bites it needed to advertise its drug to doctors. The company flooded medical journals with ads that featured good-looking people who radiated happiness, the ads touting Prozac as equal in efficacy to imipramine, and better tolerated. Science had proven that psychiatry had a new and much improved pill for depression, which appeared to correct a chemical imbalance in the brain.

392

The story that had been told in psychiatric journals was certain to resonate with the public. However, at this point, the market for antidepressants was still moderate in size. When Prozac was approved, Wall Street analysts predicted that it could generate $135 to $400 million in annual sales for Eli Lilly. But the drug companies, the APA, and the leaders of the NIMH were keen on expanding the market for antidepressants, and the NIMH’s DART “public awareness” campaign turned out to be the perfect vehicle for doing so.

392

After the NIMH announced its plans for DART in 1986, it had studied the public’s beliefs about depression. A survey revealed that only 12 percent of American adults would take a pill to treat it. Seventy-eight percent said they “would live with it until it passed,” confident they could handle it on their own. This was an attitude consistent with what the NIMH had preached only fifteen years earlier, when Dean Schuyler, head of the depressive section, had told the public that most depressive episodes “will run their course and terminate with virtually complete recovery without specific intervention.” There was epidemiological wisdom in the public’s belief that depression would pass, but the NIMH—once Shervert Frazier and other biological psychiatrists took the helm—was intent on delivering a different message.

392

The purpose of DART, the NIMH explained in 1988, was “to change public attitudes so that there is greater acceptance of depression as a disorder rather than a weakness.” The public needed to understand that it regularly went “underdiagnosed and under-treated,” and that it could “be a fatal disease” if left untreated. There were 31.4 million Americans who suffered from at least a mild form of depression, the NIMH said, and it was important that they get diagnosed. The public needed to be made aware that anti-depressants produced recovery rates of “70% to 80% in comparison with 20% to 40% for placebo.” The NIMH vowed to continue DART indefinitely in order to “inform” the public of these “facts.”27

393

The NIMH officially launched DART in May 1988, five months after Prozac landed on pharmacy shelves. The NIMH enlisted “labor, religious, educational groups” and businesses to help it spread its message, and of course pharmaceutical companies and NAMI had been on board from the start. The NIMH ran advertisements in the media, and Eli Lilly helped pay for the printing and distribution of 8 million DART brochures titled “Depression: What You Need to Know.” This pamphlet informed readers, among other things, of the particular merits of “serotonergic” drugs for the disease. “By making these materials on depressive illness available, accessible in physicians’ offices all over the country, important information is effectively reaching the public in settings which encourage questions, discussion, treatment, or referral,” said NIMH director Lewis Judd.28

The remaking of the American mind was under way. This selling of depression, which was being done under the guise of a “public education” campaign, turned into one of the most effective marketing efforts ever devised. Newspapers picked up on this story, sales of Prozac began to soar, and then, on December 18, 1989, the green-and-white pill officially gained celebrity status when New York magazine put it on its cover. BYE, BYE BLUES, the headline screamed. A NEW WONDER DRUG FOR DEPRESSION. In the article, one “anonymous” user of Prozac said that on a scale of 1 to 100, he now felt “over 100.” Thanks to this new miracle pill, the magazine concluded, psychiatrists felt that their “profession has been buoyed.”29

Other such glowing stories quickly followed. On March 26, 1990, Newsweek’s cover featured the green-and-white capsule floating Nirvana-like over a beautiful landscape. PROZAC: A BREAKTHROUGH DRUG FOR DEPRESSION the magazine announced. Physicians were now writing 650,000 prescriptions for the pill each month, and “nearly everyone has something nice to say about the new treatment,” Newsweek said. Patients were loudly exclaiming, “I never felt better!”30

Three days later, Natalie Angier of the New York Times, who arguably was the nation’s most popular science writer, explained that antidepressants “work by restoring the balance of neurotransmitter activity in the brain, correcting an abnormal excess or inhibition of the electrochemical signals that control mood, thoughts, appetite, pain and other sensations.” This new drug, Dr. Francis Mondimore told Angier, “is not like alcohol or Valium. It’s like antibiotics.”31

Television shows weighed in with a similar message, and on 60 Minutes, Lesley Stahl told the inspiring story of a woman, Maria Romero, who, after a decade of horrible depression, had been reborn on Prozac. “Somebody, something left my body and another person came in,” Romero said. Stahl happily explained the biological cure that was at work: “Most doctors believe that chronic depression like Romero’s is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. To correct it, the doctor prescribed Prozac.”32

Fairly early on, there was a moment when this wonder-drug story threatened to fall apart. The problem, of course, was that fluoxetine did in fact stir suicidal and violent thoughts in some people, and during the summer of 1990, the issue of Prozac’s safety burst into the news. And it was then, at that critical moment, that Scientology proved so useful to Eli Lilly and the psychiatric establishment.

395

By 1990, so many people had suffered bad reactions to fluoxetine that a national Prozac Survivors Support Group had formed. Many harmed by the drug had taken their complaints to lawyers, and two lawsuits in particular grabbed the public’s attention. First, on July 18, newspapers reported that a Long Island woman, Rhoda Hala, was suing Eli Lilly because, after going on Prozac, she had slashed her wrists and “other parts of her body hundreds of times.”33 Two weeks later, newspapers reported on a lawsuit related to a mass murder committed by a crazed Kentucky man. Five weeks after starting the drug, Joseph Wesbecker walked into a Louisville printing plant where he had worked and opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing eight and wounding twelve.

395

The Citizens Commission on Human Rights quickly issued a press release urging Congress to ban this “killer drug,” and that’s when Eli Lilly pounced. These lawsuits, Eli Lilly loudly announced, “are being drummed up by the Scientology group, which has a history of criticizing the use of psychiatric drugs.”34

396

This was the start of Eli Lilly’s campaign to save its blockbuster drug. “Lilly can go down the tubes if we lose Prozac,” wrote chief medical officer Leigh Thompson, in a harried 1990 memo.35 The company quickly honed a four-point message for the media: This was an issue being raised by Scientologists; extensive clinical trials had shown that Prozac was a safe drug; the suicidal and homicidal events were “in the disease, not the drug;” and “people who could be helped are being scared away from treatment, and that’s the real public menace.”36

396

The company ran media-training sessions for the academic psychiatrists it hired as consultants, getting them to practice their delivery of this message. “Frankly, I was unimpressed with the performance of our outside professionals,” company vice-president Mitch Daniels complained to Thompson after one such practice session in April 1991. The company would “mandate” that the academic psychiatrists perform better “in their future training sessions,” he said.37

524

37. Ibid.

397

An article that appeared in the Wall Street Journal on April 19, 1991, showed that Eli Lilly’s training sessions had paid off. “Scientology,” the paper informed its readers, was a “quasi-religious/business/paramilitary organization” that was “waging war on psychiatry.” The group had attacked Prozac’s safety even though “doctors unaffiliated with Lilly” had found, during the clinical trials, that there was “a lower tendency toward suicidal thinking with Prozac than with other antidepressants, or with the starch capsules given to a control group.” It was, Leigh Thompson said, a “demoralizing revelation to watch twenty years of solid research by doctors and scientists shouted down in twenty-second sound bites by Scientologists and lawyers.”

397

Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reported, Eli Lilly, in response to concerns about Prozac’s safety, had asked “suicide experts” to re-scrutinize the trial data, but they had “concluded that nothing in the clinical trials linked suicidal thinking—common in depression patients—to Prozac.” It was the disease, not the drug, and that was the tragedy, explained Jerrold Rosenbaum, a Harvard psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital. “The public’s fear of Prozac as a result of this campaign has itself become a potentially serious public-health problem as people stay away from treatment.”38

524

397

Rosenbaum, naturally, was one of Eli Lilly’s “outside professionals.” As the Boston Globe later reported, he “sat on a marketing advisory panel for Lilly before Prozac was launched,” his relationship to Eli Lilly a “cozy” one.39 But the Wall Street Journal presented him as an independent expert, one of the nation’s top depression doctors, and so readers could only draw one conclusion: This was an issue conjured up by noxious Scientologists, rather than a legitimate concern. Other newspapers and magazines framed the issue in that way, with Time, in May of that year, publishing a scathing cover story on Scientology, calling it a “criminal organization” that attracted “psychopaths.”40

On September 20, 1991, the FDA did convene a hearing on whether Prozac elevated the risk of suicide, but the advisory panel, which was dominated by physicians with ties to pharmaceutical companies, showed little interest in seriously investigating this question. Although more than two dozen citizens testified on the harm that the drug could cause, the panel made sure that the scientific discussion was limited to presentations that supported Eli Lilly’s position that fluoxetine was perfectly safe. As the Wall Street Journal reported, the scientific data presented at the hearing proved that “fluoxetine doesn’t lead to increased suicide or suicidal thinking, and, in fact, show that the drug helps alleviate these conditions.” The entire controversy, one Lilly supporter told the Journal, was a “complete fiction” that had been “organized and funded by an anti-psychiatric group.”41

524

41. T. Burton, “Panel finds no credible evidence to tie Prozac to suicides and violent behavior,” Wall Street Journal, September 23, 1991.

399

At that moment, Eli Lilly and all of psychiatry had achieved a public relations victory of lasting importance. The wonder-drug aura around Prozac had been restored, and the public and the media had been conditioned to associate criticism of psychiatric drugs with Scientology. The debate over the merits of these drugs now seemed to feature the nation’s top scientists and doctors on one side and religious kooks on the other, and if that were so, the public could be certain where the truth lay.

399

Other SSRIs came to market, sales of Prozac hit the $1 billion mark in 1992, and then, in 1993, Brown University psychiatrist Peter Kramer, in his book Listening to Prozac, pushed the wonder-drug story up a notch. Prozac, he wrote, was making some patients “better than well.” An era of “cosmetic psychopharmacology” was dawning, Kramer suggested, with psychiatry likely to have pills in the near future that could give normal people whatever personality they wanted.

399

His book spent twenty-one weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and soon Newsweek was warning readers that it was time for society to start grappling with the ethical questions raised by psychiatry’s new powers. “The same scientific insights into the brain that led to the development of Prozac are raising the prospect of nothing less than made-to-order, off-the-shelf personalities,” Newsweek explained in 1994. Will those who refuse to “give their brain a makeover,” the magazine asked, be left behind?

As the Prozac story unfolded in the media, surely the ghost of John Brinkley was smiling somewhere. He had transfixed listeners to his radio show with tales of the wonders of transplanted goat gonads, and now here was a storytelling process that had transformed a drug “totally unsuited” for treating depression into a miracle compound, with psychiatrists publicly wringing their hands over their new godlike powers to shape the human mind. Should they worry about making people “better than well”? Would our society lose something precious if everybody were happy all the time?

400

The widespread medicating of the American mind was now under way, and—as a very quick review will reveal—it was this same storytelling process that supported the launch of Xanax as a drug for panic disorder and the atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia. Once those “second-generation” drugs became blockbusters, the drug companies and academic psychiatrists began touting psychiatric drugs of all kinds for use in children, this storytelling sweeping millions of American youth into the “mental illness” bin.

400

Xanax (alprazolam) was approved by the FDA as an anti-anxiety agent in 1981, and then Upjohn set out to get it approved for panic disorder, which had been newly identified as a discrete condition for the first time in DSM-III (1980). As a first step, it hired former NIMH director Gerald Klerman to co-chair its “steering committee” for the testing process, and it paid Daniel Freedman, editor of the Archives of General Psychiatry, to be an assistant to its “division of medical affairs.”43 This was just part of the company’s efforts to co-opt academic psychiatry: “The most senior psychiatrists in the world were flooded with offers of consultancies” from Upjohn, said Isaac Marks, an expert in anxiety disorders at the Institute of Psychiatry in London.44

Klerman and Upjohn designed Upjohn’s Cross National Collaborative Panic Study in a manner that could be expected to produce a poor placebo response. Patients who had been on benzodiazepines were allowed into the study, which meant that many in the placebo group would in fact be going through the horrors of benzodiazepine withdrawal, and thus could be expected to be extremely anxious during the first weeks of the trial. Nearly one-fourth of the placebo patients had traces of benzodiazepines in their blood when the treatment period began.45

401

Benzodiazepines are known to work quickly, and that proved true in this study. At the end of four weeks, 82 percent of the alprazolam patients were “moderately improved” or “better,” versus 43 percent of the placebo group. However, during the next four weeks, the placebo patients continued to improve, while the alprazolam patients did not, and by the end of the eighth week, there “was no significant difference between the groups” on most of the rating scales, at least among the patients who remained in the study. The alprazolam group also experienced a variety of troubling side effects: sedation, fatigue, slurred speech, amnesia, and poor coordination. One of every twenty-six alprazolam patients suffered a “serious” reaction to the drug, such as mania or aggressive behavior.46

525

46. R. Noyes, “Alprazolam in panic disorder and agoraphobia,” Archives of General Psychiatry 45 (1988): 423–28.

402

At the end of eight weeks, the patients were tapered from their medication for four weeks and then followed while medication-free for another two weeks. The results were predictable. Thirty-nine percent of those withdrawn from alprazolam “deteriorated significantly,” their panic and anxiety skyrocketing to such an extent they had to start taking the medication again. Thirty-five percent of the alprazolam patients suffered “rebound” panic and anxiety symptoms more severe than when the study began, and an equal percentage suffered a host of debilitating new symptoms, including confusion, heightened sensory perceptions, depression, a feeling that insects were crawling over them, muscle cramps, blurred vision, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and weight loss.47

402

In sum, at the end of fourteen weeks, the drug-exposed patients were worse off than the placebo group: They were more phobic, more anxious, more panic stricken, and doing worse on a “global scale” that assessed overall well-being. Forty-four percent had been unable to get off the drug, on their way to a lifetime of addiction. In every way, the results painted a powerful portrait of the benzo trap: This was a drug that worked for a short time, then its efficacy over a placebo petered out, and yet when patients tried to go off the drug, they became quite sick and many couldn’t kick the habit. The first few weeks of relief came at a very high long-term cost, with those stuck on the drug—as previous benzodiazepine studies had shown—likely to end up physically, emotionally, and cognitively impaired.

402

The Xanax Study

403

In Upjohn’s study of Xanax, patients were treated with the drug or placebo for eight weeks. Then this treatment was slowly withdrawn (weeks 9 through 12), and during the last two weeks patients didn’t receive any treatment. The Xanax patients fared better during the first four weeks, which is the result that the Upjohn investigators focused on in their journal articles. However, once the Xanax patients began withdrawing from the the drug, they suffered many more panic attacks than the placebo patients, and at the end of the study were much more symptomatic.

The Upjohn investigators published three articles in the Archives of General Psychiatry in May 1988, and anyone who carefully reviewed the data could see the harm caused by alprazolam. But in order for Xanax to be successfully marketed, Upjohn needed its investigators to draw a different sort of conclusion, and so they did, particularly in the abstracts of the three articles.

404

First, they focused their attention on the four-week results (rather than the eight-week outcomes at the end of the treatment period), announcing that “alprazolam was found to be effective and well-tolerated.”48 Next, they noted that 84 percent of the alprazolam patients had finished the eight-week study, which was evidence that “patient acceptance of alprazolam was high.” Although their alprazolam patients regularly exhibited such problems as “slurred speech, amnesia” and other signs of “impaired mentation,” they still concluded that the drug had “few side effects and is well tolerated.”49 Finally, while they acknowledged that some alprazolam patients fared poorly when the drug was withdrawn, they reasoned that it had been used for too short a period and the withdrawal done too abruptly. “We recommend that patients with panic disorder be treated for a longer period, at least six months,” they said.50

In London, Isaac Marks and several of his colleagues at the Institute of Psychiatry subsequently pointed out how transparently ridiculous this all was. In a letter to the Archives of General Psychiatry, they observed that since the alprazolam patients “were in a worse state than patients receiving placebo” at the end of the study, the finding by the Upjohn investigators that the drug was effective and well tolerated could only be seen as “biased and arguable.”51 The entire affair, Marks subsequently wrote, “is a classic demonstration of the hazards of research funded by industry.”52

405

Yet the fact that the alprazolam patients came to such a bad end, with many on a path to a lifelong addiction, did not deter Upjohn, Klerman, the APA, and the NIMH from touting Xanax’s benefits to the American public. The same marketing machinery that had made Prozac a bestseller was rolled out again. Upjohn sponsored a symposium at the APA’s 1988 meeting where the “expert panel” highlighted the four-week results. Robert Pasnau, who had been head of the APA in 1987, sent a glossy booklet on the Consequences of Anxiety to APA members, an “educational” effort paid for by Upjohn. Both Shervert Frazier and Gerald Klerman penned a “Dear Doctor” letter that Upjohn included in the promotional literature it sent to doctors about Xanax as a treatment for panic disorder. Upjohn also gave $1.5 million to the APA so that it could mount a DART-like campaign to “educate” psychiatrists, health-care workers, and the public about panic disorder, which was said to be “under-recognized and undertreated.”53 Finally, the NIMH chipped in too, identifying panic disorder as a priority concern and sponsoring a conference in 1991 on it, with its panel of experts designating “high potency benzodiazepines”—this would be Xanax—as one of the two “treatments of choice.”54

The FDA approved Xanax as a treatment for panic disorder in November 1990, and many newspapers and magazines ran the usual features. IN A PANIC? HELP IS ON THE WAY, a St. Louis Post-Dispatch headline announced. Treatment, the paper said, helped 70 to 90 percent of those with the debilitating condition, which afflicted “4 million adults in this country.”55 The Associated Press explained that “a biochemical malfunctioning in the brain is believed to be one of the causes of panic attacks. Xanax can block the attacks by interacting with several different systems in the brain.”56 In the Chicago Sun-Times, Dr. John Zajecka at Rush Medical College in Chicago announced that “Xanax is the fastest acting and least toxic” of medications for the disorder.57 Once again, a very effective, safe drug had arrived on the market, and in 1992, Xanax became the fifth most frequently prescribed medication in the United States.58

Even as Xanax was on the way to market as a treatment for panic disorder, Janssen was conducting tests of risperidone, a new drug for schizophrenia. By this time, the methods that pharmaceutical firms were employing to create new “blockbuster” psychotropics were becoming quite well practiced, with nearly everyone employing the Prozac model of drug development, and so Janssen, like Eli Lilly and Upjohn, designed trials that were biased in favor of its drug. In particular, Janssen compared multiple doses of risperidone to a high dose of haloperidol (Haldol), as it could then be relatively certain that one of the risperidone doses would have a good safety profile in comparison to the old “standard” neuroleptic. As FDA reviewers noted, these studies were “incapable” of providing any meaningful comparison of the two drugs.59 In the FDA’s letter of approval to Janssen, Robert Temple, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation, made this clear:

We would consider any advertisement or promotion labeling for RISPERDAL false, misleading, or lacking fair balance under section 502 (a) and 502 (n) of the ACT if there is presentation of data that conveys the impression that risperidone is superior to haloperidol or any other marketed antipsychotic drug product with regard to safety or effectiveness.60

525

59. FDA reviews of risperidone data included the following written commentaries: reviews by Andrew Mosholder, May 11, 1993, and November 7, 1993; David Hoberman, April 20, 1993; and Thomas Laughren, December 20, 1993.

60. Approval letter from Robert Temple to Janssen Research Foundation, December 29, 1993.

407

However, while the FDA could prohibit Janssen from placing advertisements touting its drug as superior to haloperidol, it did not have authority over what the academic psychiatrists hired by Janssen could say. This was the commercial beauty of the “partnership” that had emerged between psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry during the 1980s—the academic doctors could make claims, both in their medical journals and to the public, that the FDA considered false in kind.

407

In this case, they published more than twenty articles in psychiatric journals touting risperidone as equal or superior to haloperidol in reducing positive symptoms of schizophrenia (psychosis) and superior to haloperidol in improving negative symptoms (lack of emotion). The academic doctors reported that risperidone reduced hospital stays, improved the patient’s ability to function socially, and reduced hostility. “Risperidone has important advantages compared with haloperidol,” they wrote in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. “When administered in an effective dose range, risperidone produced greater improvements on all five dimensions of schizophrenia.”61

408

Once again, this was a scientific story of a new and improved treatment, and in their interviews with the media, Janssen’s investigators told of a wonder drug. This new agent, the Washington Post reported, “represents a glimmer of hope for a disease that until recently had been considered hopeless.” Risperidone, it explained, did not “cause sedation, blurred vision, impaired memory or muscle stiffness, side effects commonly associated with an earlier generation of antipsychotic drugs.”62 The New York Times, quoting Richard Meibach, Janssen’s clinical research director, reported that “no major side effects” had appeared in the two-thousand-plus patients treated with risperidone in the clinical trials.* The drug was thought to “relieve schizophrenia symptoms by blocking excessive flows of serotonin or dopamine, or both,” the paper said.63

408

The atypical revolution was on. Risperdal apparently restored sanity by balancing multiple neurotransmitters in the brain, and it seemed to cause no side effects of any note. In 1996, Eli Lilly brought Zyprexa (olanzapine) to market, and the public story of the wonders of atypicals got ramped up another notch.

409

As had become customary, Eli Lilly employed trials that were “biased by design” against haloperidol, the FDA concluded. As a result, its large phase III trial, which wasn’t placebo controlled, provided “little useful efficacy data.” As for olanzapine’s safety profile, twenty patients treated with the drug during the trials died, 22 percent suffered a “serious” adverse event (higher than in the haloperidol patients), and two-thirds failed to complete the studies. Olanzapine, the data suggested, made patients sleepy and fat, and caused such problems as Parkinsonian symptoms, akathisia, dystonia, hypotension, constipation, tachycardia, diabetes, seizures, leaking breasts, impotence, liver abnormalities, and white blood cell disorders. Furthermore, warned the FDA’s Paul Leber, since olanzapine blocked receptors for many types of neurotransmitters, “no one should be surprised if, upon marketing, events of all kinds and severity not previously identified are reported in association with olanzapine’s use.”64

526

64. FDA reviews of olanzapine data included the following written commentaries: reviews by Thomas Laughren on September 27, 1996; by Paul Andreason on July 29 and September 26, 1996; and by Paul Leber on August 18 and August 30, 1996.

410

That was the story told by the trial data. The story that Eli Lilly wanted to appear in the medical journals and newspapers was that Zyprexa was better than Janssen’s Risperdal, and so that’s the story that its hired guns told. Psychiatrists from academic medical schools announced that olanzapine worked in a more “comprehensive” manner than either risperidone or haloperidol. It was a well-tolerated agent that led to global improvement—it reduced positive symptoms, caused fewer motor side effects than other antipsychotics, and improved negative symptoms and cognitive function.65 This second atypical was better than the first, and the Wall Street Journal ran with that angle. Zyprexa, it announced, “has substantial advantages” over other current therapies. “The real world,” explained John Zajecka, from Rush Medical College, “is finding that Zyprexa has fewer extrapyramidal side effects than Risperdal.”66 Zyprexa is “a potential breakthrough of tremendous magnitude,” Stanford University psychiatrist Alan Schatzberg told the New York Times

The only question now seemed to be whether Zyprexa was truly better than Risperdal, and after AstraZeneca brought a third atypical to market, Seroquel, the media settled on the notion that collectively the new atypicals were a dramatic improvement over the older drugs. They were, Parade told its readers, “far safer and more effective in treating negative symptoms, such as difficulty in reasoning and speaking in an organized way.”68 The newer drugs, the Chicago Tribune announced, “are safer and more effective than older ones. They help people go to work.”69 Wrote the Los Angeles Times, “It used to be that schizophrenics were given no hope of improving. But now, thanks to new drugs and commitment, they’re moving back into society like never before.”70 NAMI chimed in, too, publishing a book titled Breakthroughs in Antipsychotic Medications, which helpfully explained that these new drugs “do a better job of balancing all of the brain chemicals, including dopamine and serotonin.”71 On and on it went, and finally NAMI’s executive director, Laurie Flynn, told the press that the promised land had at last been reached: “These new drugs truly are a breakthrough. They mean we should finally be able to keep people out of the hospital, and it means that the long-term disability of schizophrenia can come to an end.”72

That was the sequence of storytelling that led to the explosive rise in the use of psychiatric drugs in the United States. First, American psychiatrists touted Prozac as a wonder drug, next they hailed Xanax as a safe and effective therapy for panic disorder, and finally they informed the public that atypical antipsychotics were “breakthrough” medications for schizophrenia. In this way, they rejuvenated the market for psychiatric medications, even though the clinical studies of the new drugs had not told of any therapeutic advance.

At least in scientific circles, the “wonder drug” glow around the second-generation psychotropics has long since disappeared. As we learned earlier, the SSRIs were reported in 2008 to provide a meaningful clinical benefit only to severely depressed patients. Xanax is now understood to be much more addictive than Valium, with various investigators determining that two-thirds of people who take it for any length of time have trouble getting off it.73 As for the top-selling atypicals, the hyping of these drugs is now viewed as one of the more embarrassing episodes in psychiatry’s history, as one government-funded study after another failed to find that they were any better than the first-generation antipsychotics.

In 2005, the NIMH’s “CATIE Trial” determined that there were “no significant differences” between the atypicals and their predecessors, and even more troubling, in this study neither the new drugs nor the old ones could really be said to work. Seventy-four percent of the 1,432 patients were unable to stay on the medications, mostly because of their “inefficacy or intolerable side effects.”74 A study by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs came to a similar conclusion about the relative merits of atypicals and the older drugs, and then, in 2007, British psychiatrists reported that schizophrenia patients, if anything, had a better “quality of life” on the old drugs than on the new ones.75

All of this led two prominent psychiatrists to write in the Lancet that the story of the atypicals as breakthrough medications could now be “regarded as invention only,” a tale concocted “by the drug industry for marketing purposes and only now being exposed.” Yet, they wondered, “how is it that for nearly two decades we have, as some have put it, ‘been beguiled’ into thinking they were superior?”76

History, as readers of this book can attest, reveals the answer to that question. The seed for the atypicals story was planted in the early 1980s, when the APA embraced “biological psychiatry” as a story that could be successfully marketed to the public. This was also a story that the field, as a whole, desperately wanted to believe in, and soon Nancy Andreasen and others were telling of a revolution that was under way, with mental illnesses finally giving up their biological secrets, even though nobody could precisely explain what those secrets were. That story gained steam, prepping the public to believe that therapeutic advances were on the way, and as pharmaceutical companies brought new medications to market, they hired the top psychiatrists in the country to tell of how these new wondrous drugs “balanced” brain chemistry. And it was that co-opting of academic medicine that gave the story its credibility. This was a story told by Harvard Medical School psychiatrist Jerrold Rosenbaum, by former NIMH director Gerald Klerman, and by Stanford University psychiatrist Alan Schatzberg.

Of course we, as a society, believed it.
