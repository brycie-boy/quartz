## ADHD  # 

- I think that the lack of motivation has less to do with a chemical imbalance, and more to do with the fact that [[Neurons reduce receptor quantity when overstimulated]] and [[There must be a balanced amount of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway to prevent lethargy or irritablility]]. Over active stress response and poor inhibition leads to excessive indulgence which drives down dopamine receptors over time

Attention deficit hyper activity disorder (ADHD) is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors, or be overly active. ADHD symptoms arise from [[Executive functions|executive dysfunction]]. The brain structure primarily implicated in ADHD [[orbitofrontal cortex]]. ADHD patients also show reduced volume in the [[cerebellum]], which can cause disjointed attention.

The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be categorized into 2¬†types of¬†behavioral problems:

-   inattentiveness (difficulty concentrating and focusing)

The main signs of inattentiveness include:
