## Self-reliance  # 

Self-reliance refers to an attitude of mind in which one places complete trust in their own intuitions and relies on themselves as the basis for truth and morality rather than [[Appeal to authority|appealing to authority]] or [[Appeal to majority|the majority]]. It is the opposite of [[conformity]]: [[to be self-reliant and innovative requires not conforming to social norms]]. I assume such an attitude would involve the [[right hemisphere]], since [[The right hemisphere attends to the personal, while the left focuses on the abstract and impersonal]].
