## Hostile weakness  # 

Hostile Weakness (The Paranoid) is one of [[the four quadrants]]. This type was known in the medieval psychology of ‚Äúhumours‚Äù as Choleric. These types were identified with the Bull archetype (truculent suspicion, paranoia) and [[the earth element]] standing for sluggish pseudo ‚Äústupidity.‚Äù (This is the traditional stance of defeated races dealing with their conquerors.) In [[Transactional Psychology]], this type is catagorized by the life script: "I'm not ok, you're not ok." These types, along with [[hostile strength]], arrive in therapy, if at all, only because their associates or families, or more commonly, a law court, has ordered them to try to re[[imprint]] their compulsive hostilities. According to the [[Leary Interpersonal Grid]], this type distrusts everybody, rebels against everything, speaks constantly in sarcasms, complains chronically and is generally bitter, resentful and (to some extent) paranoid. The sullen Bull. This type is associated with the evangalist [[Luke]] in Catholic art, and the astrological sign [[Taurus]].
