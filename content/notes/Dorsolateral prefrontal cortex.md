## Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex # 

![[Pasted image 20230619183433.png|200]]

Our sense of justice is underwritten in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. With inactivation of this area, we act more selfishly. This is probably related to the right [[frontal lobe]]'s capacity to see the other's point of view ([[The right hemisphere is responsible for the ability to put ourselves in anothers shoes]]), and for empathy in general ([[The right hemisphere is responsible for our capacity for emotional understanding]]). The right frontal lobe's capacity to inhibit our natural impulse to selfishness means that it is also the area on which we most rely for self-control and the power to resist temptation.
