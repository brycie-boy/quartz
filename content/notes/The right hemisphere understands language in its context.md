## The right hemisphere understands language in its context # 

The fact that [[the right hemisphere sees things in their context]] is particularly important when it comes to what the two hemispheres contribute to language. The [[right hemisphere]] takes whatever is said within its entire context. It is specialized in pragmatics, the art of contextual understanding of meaning, and in using metaphor. It is the [[right hemisphere]] which processes the non-literal aspects of language. This is why the [[left hemisphere]] is not good at understanding the higher level meaning of utterances such as ‘it's a bit hot in here today’ (while the [[right hemisphere]] understands ‘please open a window’, the [[left hemisphere]] assumes this is just helpful supply of meteorological data). It is also why the [[right hemisphere]] underpins the appreciation of humor, since humor depends vitally on being able to understand the context of what is said and done, and how context changes it. Subjects with [[right hemisphere]] damage, like subjects with [[schizophrenia]], who in many respects resemble them, cannot understand implied meaning, and tend to take conversational remarks literally.
