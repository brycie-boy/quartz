## Holy Writ fallacy #⏳

In the 19th century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] thought he had an infallible method of arriving at certitude — a combination of [[Pure Reason]] and Holy Writ, a writing or utterance that has unquestionable authority. This is still believed in some backward countries, but is not generally accepted in civilized nations because [[Pure Reason]] itself has been proven fallible (see [[Pure Reason fallacy]]) and because there are many varieties of Holy Writ around — and there is no known empirical test to determine which Holy Writ is the "real" Holy Writ.
