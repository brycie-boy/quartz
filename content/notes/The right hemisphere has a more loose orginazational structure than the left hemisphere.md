## The right hemisphere has a more loose orginazational structure than the left hemisphere   # 

In general the [[left hemisphere]] is more closely interconnected within itself, and within regions of itself, than the [[right hemisphere]]. This is all part of its close focus style, but it is also a reflection at the neural level of the essentially self-referring nature of the world of the [[left hemisphere]]: [[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]]. By contrast, the [[right hemisphere]] has a greater degree of [[myelin]]ation, facilitating swift transfer of information between the [[cortex]] and centres below the [[cortex]] and greater connectivity in general. Functionally its superior integration is evidenced by EEG measures and by the more diffuse but overlapping somatosensory projections (carrying information on touch, pain and body position) and auditory inputs on the right side of the [[brain]].
