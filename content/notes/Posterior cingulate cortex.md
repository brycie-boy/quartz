## Posterior cingulate cortex  # 

The posterior cingulate cortex is the central node of the [[default mode network]] and is correlated with self-reference, thinking about others, remembering the past, planning for the future, [[identity view]], or when [[clinging]] to or trying to control one‚Äôs experience. Where as [[non-forcing]], [[mindfulness]], and [[flow]] showed reduced activity. The mode of subjective experience that lined up with posterior cingulate cortex activity is not the perception of an object, but how we relate to it. It‚Äôs one thing to have [[craving]]s, but quite another to get caught up in your [[craving]]s. In a sense, if we try to control the outcome of a situation, we have to work hard at doing something to get the results we want. When the posterior cingulate cortex goes awry is at the root of several forms of mental suffering, including [[addiction]], [[depression]] , obsession, and [[ruminative response style]]s.
