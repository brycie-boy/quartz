## Psychedelics let in extra sensory signals by inhibiting the brains ordinary sensory inhibition process  # 

Because of how [[decreased default mode network activity may loosen the inhibitory mechanims in the brain]] and [[psychedelics have been shown to reduce activity in the default mode network]], then It seems plausable to assume that the mechanism of [[psychedelic]]s inhibit the processes in which [[Our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important]], thus activating areas of the [[brain]] that are that are [[habit]]ually deactivated. The subject is then percieving maybe 20 to 100 sensory signals per minute instead of the usual 10. This is enough to produce histarical laughter, profound awe, or accute anxiety.
