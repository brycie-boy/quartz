## ADHD and addiction can be traced to similar causes  # 

The link between [[ADHD]] and a predisposition to [[addiction]] is obvious and, in fact, inevitable. The connection has little to do with [[gene]]tics. [[ADHD]] is no more inherited genetically than [[addiction]] is, despite the widespread assumption among ADHD experts that it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe most heritable of all mental disorders.‚Äù Like [[addition]], scientific findings since then have only confirmed that pre- and postnatal stresses are the most important determinants of [[ADHD]] (see [[Childhood development plays a strong role in the development of mental illness and addiction]]). According to a 2004 study by B. R. Van den Bergh and A. Marcoen, for example, percent of [[ADHD]] symptoms in eight- and nine-year-old children can be directly linked to maternal anxiety during pregnancy. Abused children are far more likely than others to be diagnosed with [[ADHD]], and the same [[brain]] structures affected by childhood trauma are most consistently abnormal in scans of children with [[ADHD]]. [[The quality of the realtionships with childhood caregivers determines the capacity for a healthy stress-response]].
