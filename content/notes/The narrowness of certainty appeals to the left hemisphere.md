## The narrowness of certainty appeals to the left hemisphere # 

[[The right hemisphere can understand unclear and fleeting images, while the left requires clarity and stillness]]. Also, [[the right hemisphere has broad, global attention, while the left has narrow attention]], and certainty is also related to narrowness, as though the more certain we become of something the less we see. To put this in the context of the neurophysiology of vision: the [[fovea]] of the human [[eye]], a tiny region in the [[retina]] at the center of gaze, is the most pronounced of that of all primates. Here resolution is about 100 times that at the periphery. But it is only about 1° across. The part of the visual field that is actually brought into resolution is no more than about 3° across. This is where the narrow focused beam of [[left hemisphere]] attention is concentrated: what is clearly seen.
