## A shortage of serotonin in the brain has not yet been found in depression patients  # 

In a study of eight [[depression|depressed]] patients (all of whom had been previously exposed to [[antidepressant]]s), Dr. [[Malcom Bowers]] and his team had announced that their [[5-HIAA]] levels were lower than normal, but not ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù so. Two years later, investigators at McGill University said that they, too, had failed to find a ‚Äústatistically significant‚Äù difference in the [[5-HIAA]] levels of depressed patients and normal controls, and that they also had failed to find any correlation between [[5-HIAA]] levels and the severity of depressive symptoms. In 1974, Bowers was back with a more finely tuned follow-up study: [[depression|Depressed]] patients who had not been exposed to antidepressants had perfectly normal [[5-HIAA]] levels.
