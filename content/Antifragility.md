## Antifragility # 

Antifragility is a term attributed to [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] which refers to things that require [[stressor]]s and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. It contrasts with fragility: things that break easily and cannot heal themselves. However, It is also to be distinguished from "resilience" which only implies that something can withstand repeated [[stressor]]s, but does not benefit from them. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously.
