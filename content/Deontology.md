## Deontology

Deontology is an ethical theory which states that the [morality](morality.md) of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules and principles, rather than based on the consequences of the action (contra [Consequentialism](Consequentialism.md)). In deontological ethics, a *moral obligation* may arise from an external or internal source, such as a set of rules inherent to the universe, or a set of cultural values (which may be in conflict with personal desires).
