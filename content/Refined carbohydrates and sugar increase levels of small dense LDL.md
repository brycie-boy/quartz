## Refined carbohydrates and sugar increase levels of small dense LDL  # 

If you have a high [[LDL-C]] level, your provider is likely to tell you to eat a low-fat diet. Similar to statins, while your [[LDL]] will go down, it’s only affecting the large buoyant [[LDL]] and not the small dense [[LDL]], which is the actual problem. In fact, small dense [[LDL]] rises because they are responsive to dietary refined [[carbohydrate]] (i.e., fiberless food) and especially sugar consumption, which is what is substituted in lieu of the dietary fat.

One of the most compelling arguments against [[LDL-C]] as the primary target of [[heart disease]] prevention or treatment is the Lyon Diet Heart Study. The adoption of a [[Mediterranean diet]] for secondary prevention (after you’ve already had a [[heart attack]]) reduced the risk for recurrence. It’s clear that eating a diet devoid of [[processed food]] delivered far more impressive results when compared with [[statin]]s—without the side effects and at a much lower cost. And this diet is decidedly not low-fat.
