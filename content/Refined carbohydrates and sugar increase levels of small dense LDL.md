## Refined carbohydrates and sugar increase levels of small dense LDL

If you have a high [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) level, your provider is likely to tell you to eat a low-fat diet. Similar to statins, while your [LDL]() will go down, it’s only affecting the large buoyant [LDL]() and not the small dense [LDL](), which is the actual problem. In fact, small dense [LDL]() rises because they are responsive to dietary refined [carbohydrate](Carbohydrate.md) (i.e., fiberless food) and especially sugar consumption, which is what is substituted in lieu of the dietary fat.

One of the most compelling arguments against [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) as the primary target of [heart disease]() prevention or treatment is the Lyon Diet Heart Study. The adoption of a [Mediterranean diet]() for secondary prevention (after you’ve already had a [heart attack]()) reduced the risk for recurrence. It’s clear that eating a diet devoid of [processed food]() delivered far more impressive results when compared with [statin]()s—without the side effects and at a much lower cost. And this diet is decidedly not low-fat.
