## The brains of abused children show reductions of the size of several brain structures

The [brain](Brain.md)s of mistreated children have been shown to be smaller than normal by 7 or 8 percent, with below-average volumes in multiple [brain](Brain.md) areas, including the [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md); the [corpus callosum](Corpus%20callosum.md), and several structures of the [Limbic system](Limbic%20system.md), whose dysfunctions greatly increase vulnerability to [addiction](Addiction.md). In a study of [depressed](Depression.md) women who had been abused in childhood, the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md) was found to be 15 percent smaller than normal. The key factor was abuse, not [depression](Depression.md), since the same [brain](Brain.md) area was unaffected in [depressed](Depression.md) women who had not been abused.
