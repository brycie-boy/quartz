## Craving  #üß†

In Buddhism, craving is a compelling sense of need for something which is expressed through [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md). It involves desire for more pleasant objects, a desire for less painful objects, as well as a dull attachment to neutral objects. Craving is felt in the body as muscle tension and a tightness in the gut, or solar plexus area. Neurologically, craving occurs when the [dopamine](Dopamine.md) from the [ventral tegmental area](Ventral%20tegmental%20area.md) reaches the [nucleus accumbens](Nucleus%20accumbens.md). 

Craving comes in three types: craving for [pleasure](Pleasure.md), craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. The cause and condition for the manifestation of craving is [feeling](Feeling.md). Craving appears in [the four nobel truths](The%20four%20nobel%20truths.md) as the cause of dissatisfaction.
