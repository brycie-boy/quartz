## Craving  #üß† 

In Buddhism, craving is a compelling sense of need for something which is expressed through [[the three unwholesome roots]]. It involves desire for more pleasant objects, a desire for less painful objects, as well as a dull attachment to neutral objects. Craving is felt in the body as muscle tension and a tightness in the gut, or solar plexus area. Neurologically, craving occurs when [[dopamine]] bunds to the [[nucleus accumbens]] [[neuron]]s. 

Craving comes in three types: craving for [[pleasure]], craving for existence, and craving for non-existence. The cause and condition for the manifestation of craving is [[feeling]]. Craving appears in [[the four nobel truths]] as the cause of dissatisfaction.
