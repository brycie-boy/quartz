## Income inequality does not predict poor health as much in more egalitarian countries

[Income inequality is a strong predictor of poor health because it is about being made to feel poor](Income%20inequality%20is%20a%20strong%20predictor%20of%20poor%20health%20because%20it%20is%20about%20being%20made%20to%20feel%20poor.md), but the relationship between income inequality and poor health doesn‚Äôt seem to be universal. Note how flat the curve is for Canada‚Äîmoreover, you don‚Äôt find it when considering adults throughout Western Europe, particularly in countries with well-established social welfare systems like Denmark. In other words, you probably can‚Äôt pick up this effect when comparing individual parishes in Copenhagen because the overall pattern is so egalitarian in a place like that. But it‚Äôs a reasonably robust relationship in the United Kingdom, while the flagship for the health/income inequality relationship is the United States, where the top 1 percent of the SES ladder controls nearly 40 percent of the wealth, and it‚Äôs a huge effect (and persists even after controlling for race).
