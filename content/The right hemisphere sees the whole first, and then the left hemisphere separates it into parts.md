## The right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts #🧠 

[[The global attention of the right hemisphere precedes the narrow attention of the left hemisphere]], and predicatively the [[right hemisphere]] sees the whole, before whatever it is gets broken up into parts by the [[left hemisphere]] in our attempt to ‘know’ it. Its holistic processing of visual form is not based on the summation of parts. On the other hand, the [[left hemisphere]] sees part-objects. The best-known example of this process of [[right hemisphere]] Gestalt perception is the way in which the Dalmatian dog, sniffing the ground in the shade of a tree, suddenly emerges from this mass of dots and splashes:

The process is not a gradual putting together of bits of information, but an ‘aha!’ phenomenon—it comes all at once. The [[right hemisphere]], with its greater integrative power, is constantly searching for patterns in things. In fact its understanding is based on complex pattern recognition. This is why the [[right hemisphere]] is so often connected with “intuition,” which is a way of thinking between and around data-points on the perceptual screen—sensing what total field the points must be part of.
