## Dendrite  #🧠

Dendrites are branched extensions of a [neuron](Neuron.md) that propagate the electrochemical stimulation received from other [neuron](Neuron.md)s to the  [soma]() of the [neuron](Neuron.md) from which the dendrites project. Electrical stimulation is transmitted onto dendrites by upstream [neuron](Neuron.md)s (usually from [axon](Axon.md)s) via [synapse](Synapse.md)s which are located at various points throughout the dendritic tree.
