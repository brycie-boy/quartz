## The impact that a hierarchical rank can have on someone can change depending on their goals

[Hierarchically subordinate animals tend to be over-stressed due to uncontrollable and unpredictable mistreatment from superiors](Hierarchically%20subordinate%20animals%20tend%20to%20be%20over-stressed%20due%20to%20uncontrollable%20and%20unpredictable%20mistreatment%20from%20superiors.md), but humans can put all sorts of spin inside their heads about ranks. Consider a marathon being observed by a Martian scientist studying physiology and rank in humans. The obvious thing to do is keep track of the order in which people finish the race. Runner 1 dominates 5, who clearly dominates 5,000. But what if runner 5,000 is a couch potato who took up running just a few months ago, who half expected to keel over from a coronary by mile 13 and instead finished‚Äîsure, hours after the crowds wandered off‚Äîbut finished, exhausted and glowing. And what if runner 5 had spent the previous week reading in the sports section that someone of their world-class quality should certainly finish in the top three, maybe even blow away the field. No Martian on earth could predict correctly who is going to feel exultantly dominant afterward.

People are as likely to race against themselves, their own previous best time, as against some external yardstick. This can be seen in the corporate world as well. An artificial example: the kid in the mailroom is doing a fabulous job and is rewarded, implausibly, with a $50,000 a year salary. A senior vice president screws up big-time and is punished, even more implausibly, with a $50,001 a year salary. By the perspective of that Martian, or even by a hierarchically minded wildebeest, it‚Äôs obvious that the vice president is in better shape to acquire the nuts and berries needed for survival. But you can guess who is going to be going to work contentedly and who is going to be making angry phone calls to a headhunter from the cell phone in the BMW. Humans can play [rationalizing](Rationalization.md) games with rank based on their knowledge of what determined their placement. Consider the following fascinating example: guys who win at some sort of competitive interaction typically show at least a small rise in their circulating [testosterone]() levels‚Äîunless they consider the win to have come from sheer luck.
