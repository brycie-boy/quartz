## Without stressors, our bodies and minds will deteriorate # 

The harm in the [[Untruth of Fragility]] is that human beings are [[Antifragility|antifragile]], that is, we need physical and mental challenges and [[stressor]]s or we will deteriorate. For example, [[muscle]]s and [[joint]]s need [[stressor]]s to develop properly. Too much rest causes [[muscle]]s to atrophy, [[joint]]s to lose range of motion, [[heart]] and [[lung]] function to decline, and [[blood clot]]s to form. Without the challenges imposed by [[gravity]], astronauts develop [[muscle]] weakness and [[joint]] degeneration.
