## The right hemisphere is responsible for our sense of time as continuous and unified

[The right hemisphere sees things in their context](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20things%20in%20their%20context.md), and time is the context that gives meaning to everything in this world, and conversely everything that has meaning for us in this world, everything that has a place in our lives, exists in time. This is not true of abstractions and re-presentations of entities, but all that is is subject to time. The sense of time passing is associated with sustained attention ([The right hemisphere handles alertness, vigilance, sustained attention, and divided attention](The%20right%20hemisphere%20handles%20alertness,%20vigilance,%20sustained%20attention,%20and%20divided%20attention.md)), and even if for that reason alone, it is only to be expected that this arises in the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), subserved by the right [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md) and [inferior parietal lobe](). The ability to compare duration in time is clearly better performed by the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), and relies on the right [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex](Dorsolateral%20prefrontal%20cortex.md). In fact virtually all aspects of the appreciation of time, in the sense of something lived through, with a past, present and future, are dependent on the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), principally the right [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md) and [parietal cortex](). The sense of past or future is severely impaired in [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) damage. By contrast, [the left hemisphere perceives time as a sequential series of fragmented individual moments](The%20left%20hemisphere%20perceives%20time%20as%20a%20sequential%20series%20of%20fragmented%20individual%20moments.md).
