## The right hemisphere is responsible for our sense of time as continuous and unified # 

[[The right hemisphere sees things in their context]], and time is the context that gives meaning to everything in this world, and conversely everything that has meaning for us in this world, everything that has a place in our lives, exists in time. This is not true of abstractions and re-presentations of entities, but all that is is subject to time. The sense of time passing is associated with sustained attention ([[The right hemisphere handles alertness, vigilance, sustained attention, and divided attention]]), and even if for that reason alone, it is only to be expected that this arises in the [[right hemisphere]], subserved by the right [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[inferior parietal lobe]]. The ability to compare duration in time is clearly better performed by the [[right hemisphere]], and relies on the right [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]]. In fact virtually all aspects of the appreciation of time, in the sense of something lived through, with a past, present and future, are dependent on the [[right hemisphere]], principally the right [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[parietal cortex]]. The sense of past or future is severely impaired in [[right hemisphere]] damage. By contrast, [[the left hemisphere perceives time as a sequential series of fragmented individual moments]].
