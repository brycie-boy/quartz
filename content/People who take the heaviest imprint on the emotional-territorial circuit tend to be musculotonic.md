Those who, in extreme cases, take the heaviest [[imprint]] on the [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] tend to be musculotonic. That is, they hold most of their attention and energy, in the muscular attack-defense systems and grow up medium weight—heavy enough to be hard to knock down, light enough to be quick and sinewy. Often, they become body-builders, weight-lifters etc. and have an extraordinary absorption in demonstrating their strength.
