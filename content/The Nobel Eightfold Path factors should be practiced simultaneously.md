## The Nobel Eightfold Path factors should be practiced simultaneously  #‚è≥ 

Contrary to common assumtion, [[The Nobel Eightfold Path]] is not a series of steps to be followed in sequence. They're more appropriately described as components rather than steps. Optimally, each factor should be present simultaneously, each making its own distinctive contribution. Like eight interwoven strands of a cable that give the cable maximum strength. However, until that stage is reached, it is inevitable that the factors exhibit some degree of sequence in there development.
