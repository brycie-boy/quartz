## The high rate of sterilization in Nazi Germany encouraged the U.S. and other countries to pick up the pace

[The U.S. was boadly supportive of the eugenics legislation passed in Germany in 1933](The%20U.S.%20was%20boadly%20supportive%20of%20the%20eugenics%20legislation%20passed%20in%20Germany%20in%201933.md). Over the next six years, Germany sterilized 375,000 of its citizens. The pace of eugenic sterilization during this period picked up in the United States as well, and the Scandinavian countries also sterilized a number of their “defectives.” A eugenic treatment born in the United States had spread into a half dozen European countries. However, Germany was employing it with a fervor missing in the United States, which led some American [eugenicists](Eugenics.md) to fret that [Hitler]() was now “beating us at our own game.” While America was “pussy-footing around” with the procedure, complained [Leon Whitney](), field secretary for the American [Eugenics](Eugenics.md) Society, Germany was making “herself a stronger nation.”
