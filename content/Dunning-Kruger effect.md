## Dunning-Kruger effect

The Dunning–Kruger effect is a kind of bias whereby people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a certain type of task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge. Some researchers also include in their definition the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills. One explanation for this phenomena is that [poor performers are less able to distiguish between good and bad performances](Poor%20performers%20are%20less%20able%20to%20distiguish%20between%20good%20and%20bad%20performances.md).
