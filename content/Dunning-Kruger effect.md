## Dunning-Kruger effect  # 

The Dunning–Kruger effect is a kind of bias whereby people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a certain type of task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge. Some researchers also include in their definition the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills. One explanation for this phenomena is that [[poor performers are less able to distiguish between good and bad performances]].
