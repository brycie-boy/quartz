## Synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened through life experiences and frequency of use

One way neurological circuits change is by the strengthening or weakening of [synapse](Synapse.md)s, the connections between [neuron](Neuron.md)s. Different experiences cause synaptic strengths to vary within and across many neural systems, experience shapes the design of circuits. As a result, the design of [brain](Brain.md) circuits continues to change. The circuits are not only receptive to the results of first experience, but are pliable and modifiable by continued experience. 

For example, the right posterior [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md), the area of the [brain](Brain.md) which stores complex three-dimensional maps in space, is larger in London cabbies, taxi drivers with extensive navigational experience. Another vivid demonstration of the principle comes from the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) of songbirds, which expands during the mating season, and then shrinks again once the mating season is over. 

The strength of [synapse](Synapse.md)s is influenced by many factors, including the frequency of their use or disuse, or the composition of body chemistry from one situation to the next. Circuits are also weakened or enhanced by other circuits that may interfere with their functions or assist them.
