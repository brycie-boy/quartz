## Depressive realism

[Depressive](Depression.md) realism is the hypothesis developed by [Lauren Allow]() and [Lyn Yvonne Adramson]() that [depressed](Depression.md) individuals in some cases make more realistic inferences than non-[depressed](Depression.md) individuals. Although [depressed](Depression.md) individuals are thought to always have a negative [cognitive distortion](Cognitive%20distortion.md), [depressive](Depression.md) realism argues not only that this negativity may reflect a more accurate appraisal of the world but also that non-[depressed](Depression.md) individuals' appraisals are positively biased. 

The fact that [the right frontal lobe has a depressive stance, where as the left shows undue cheerfulness](The%20right%20frontal%20lobe%20has%20a%20depressive%20stance,%20where%20as%20the%20left%20shows%20undue%20cheerfulness.md) is supportive of this idea. Especially considering that [the right hemisphere deals with real things that have meaning to us in the lived world](The%20right%20hemisphere%20deals%20with%20real%20things%20that%20have%20meaning%20to%20us%20in%20the%20lived%20world.md), while [The left hemisphere deals with non-realistic and artificial images](The%20left%20hemisphere%20deals%20with%20non-realistic%20and%20artificial%20images.md). Also, [the right hemisphere is more realistic but also more pessimistic and favors depression](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20more%20realistic%20but%20also%20more%20pessimistic%20and%20favors%20depression.md). Perhaps [depressive](Depression.md) realism is [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) [depression](Depression.md), since [the right hemisphere brings anxious, disturbed depression while the left brings indifferent or apathetic depression](The%20right%20hemisphere%20brings%20anxious,%20disturbed%20depression%20while%20the%20left%20brings%20indifferent%20or%20apathetic%20depression.md).
