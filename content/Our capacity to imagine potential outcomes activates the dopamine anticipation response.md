## Our capacity to imagine potential outcomes activates the dopamine anticipation response

[Mental simulations evolved to allow us to anticipate potential outcomes and make the best approach](Mental%20simulations%20evolved%20to%20allow%20us%20to%20anticipate%20potential%20outcomes%20and%20make%20the%20best%20approach.md). But in some instances these same types of simulations get hijacked by the process in which [a dopamine release occurs when we explore and evaluate the potential value of novel objects and situations](A%20dopamine%20release%20occurs%20when%20we%20explore%20and%20evaluate%20the%20potential%20value%20of%20novel%20objects%20and%20situations.md), leading us to spend time ‚Äúelsewhere‚Äù when we should be doing something else. This process is what we ordinarily call daydreaming. Daydreaming is a great example of our attention being diverted from the task at hand. 

Those with an impared [orbitofrontal cortex](Orbitofrontal%20cortex.md) may have less control over these [dopamine](Dopamine.md) driven daydreams due to imparements in abilities such as the evaluation the emotional significance of stimuili, which strongly influencs what we focus on, as well as capacity to balance short-term objectives against longer-term consequences in the process of decision making.
