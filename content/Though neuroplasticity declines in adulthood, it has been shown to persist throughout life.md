## Though neuroplasticity declines in adulthood, it has been shown to persist throughout life

Early in life, [neuroplasticity](), the responsiveness of the human [brain](Brain.md) to changing conditions, is so great that infants who suffer damage to one side of their [brain](Brain.md) about the time of birth, even if they lose an entire hemisphere, may compensate for the deficit. The other half develops so that these children grow up to have nearly symmetrical facial movements and only a mild or moderate limp. With age, [neuroplasticity]() declines, but it is never completely lost. Neurological adaptability even in adulthood may be seen in the recovery many people make from a stroke. In a cerebrovascular accident, or stroke, [brain](Brain.md) tissue is destroyed, usually because of bleeding. Although [neurons, once matured, lose the capacity to divide again](Neurons,%20once%20matured,%20lose%20the%20capacity%20to%20divide%20again.md), often the patient will, in weeks or months, be able to use again a limb that was paralyzed by the stroke. New circuits have taken over, new connections have been made. “Under normal conditions ‘growth’ may be a characteristic of the brain throughout life,” writes the physician and neuroscientist Francine Benes.
