## Low-temperature search

In machine learning and AI, a low-temperature search involves reaching for the most probable or nearest-to-hand answer, like the one that worked for a similar problem in the past, and requires less energy (contra [high-temperature search](High-temperature%20search.md)). Low-temperature searches succeed more often than not.
