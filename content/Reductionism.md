## Reductionism

Reductionism is an attempt to explanation of entire systems in terms of their individual, constituent parts. Reductionism is said to imply that a system is nothing but the sum of its parts. I believe it to be the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)s way of understanding the world, because [the right hemisphere sees the whole before the left hemisphere separates it into parts](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20the%20whole%20before%20the%20left%20hemisphere%20separates%20it%20into%20parts.md).
