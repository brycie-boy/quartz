## Reductionism # 

Reductionism is any of several related philosophical ideas regarding the associations of phenomena which can be described in terms of other simpler or more fundamental phenomena. It is also described as an intellectual and philosophical position that interprets a complex system as the sum of its parts. I believe it to be the [[left hemisphere]]s way of understanding the world, because [[The right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts]].
