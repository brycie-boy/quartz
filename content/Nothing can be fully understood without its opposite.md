## Nothing can be fully understood without its opposite

Most people position themselves on one side of a divide and argue passionately that their perspective is the correct or most valid one. [Left hemispheric](Left%20hemisphere.md) single-focused studies like these are a hallmark of Western thought. They are predicated on the belief that, in order to understand something, you need to focus on it, isolate it from external factors, and then take it apart to see what it is made of. However, everything interacts as part of a larger system, as [Lao Tzu]() points out: 

 > 
 > When beauty is abstracted, then ugliness has been implied; when good is abstracted, then evil has been implied ... alive and dead are abstracted from nature. Difficult and easy abstracted from progress. Long and short abstracted from contrast. High and low abstracted from depth. Song and speech abstracted from melody. After and before abstracted from sequence.

Everything is defined by their context, as the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) would see: [the right hemisphere sees things in their context](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20things%20in%20their%20context.md). Whereas the [the left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20understand%20things%20as%20logical,%20abstract,%20and%20stripped%20of%20context.md). A military historian may study war for their entire life, but he will never truly understand its horror unless he also understands peace. The value of good health is only really apparent to those who have been seriously ill. If you are blind to the greater context when you try to understand something, then you can never truly appreciate why things behave as they do. This is not to be taken as a neutral position, but rather, that both sides of the picture are necessary. 

As [William Blake]() once stated: "Without Contraries is no progression." The conflict between these divides, he believed, is the fuel that moves the universe. Any view of the world must include them, because a universe without these dynamics simply couldn‚Äôt exist. To try to solve problems by favoring one side and dismissing the other is to fail to understand how the world works.
