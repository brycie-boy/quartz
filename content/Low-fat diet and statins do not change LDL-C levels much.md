## Low-fat diet and statins do not change LDL-C levels much

Let’s say you go see your provider, who tells you that you have high [LDL-C](LDL-C.md). Nine times out of ten you’re going to walk out of that office with a prescription for a [statin](), which inhibits [cholesterol](Cholesterol.md) synthesis. The current mindset among clinicians is to downshift everyone’s [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) through low-fat diet and drugs. Because that’s what they’re trained to do. But really how beneficial are [statin]()s, and for what? Despite governmental recommendations to eat low-fat and despite a high prescription rate of [statin]()s, at a population level [LDL-C](LDL-C.md) levels haven’t changed appreciably.
