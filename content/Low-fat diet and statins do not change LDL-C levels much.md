## Low-fat diet and statins do not change LDL-C levels much  # 

Let’s say you go see your provider, who tells you that you have high [[LDL-C]]. Nine times out of ten you’re going to walk out of that office with a prescription for a [[statin]], which inhibits [[cholesterol]] synthesis. The current mindset among clinicians is to downshift everyone’s [[LDL-C]] through low-fat diet and drugs. Because that’s what they’re trained to do. But really how beneficial are [[statin]]s, and for what? Despite governmental recommendations to eat low-fat and despite a high prescription rate of [[statin]]s, at a population level [[LDL-C]] levels haven’t changed appreciably.
