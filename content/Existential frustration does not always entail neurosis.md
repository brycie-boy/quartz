## Existential frustration does not always entail neurosis

Not every conflict is necessarily [neurotic](); some amount of conflict is normal and healthy. In a similar sense suffering is not always a pathological phenomenon; rather than being a symptom of [neurosis](), suffering may well be a human achievement, especially if the suffering grows out of [existential frustration](Existential%20frustration.md). [Frankl]() would strictly deny that one‚Äôs search for a meaning to their existence, or even their doubt of it, in every case is derived from, or results in, any disease. [Existential frustration](Existential%20frustration.md) is in itself neither [pathological]() nor pathogenic. A persons concern, even their despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. It may well be that interpreting the first in terms of the latter motivates a doctor to bury their patient‚Äôs existential despair under a heap of tranquilizing drugs. It is their task, rather, to pilot the patient through their existential crises of growth and development.

[Logotherapy]() deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the conflicting claims of [id](), [ego](Ego.md) and [superego](), or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and environment.
