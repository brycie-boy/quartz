## Ketones can help prevent  neurodegenerative disease

The health benefits of metabolizing [ketone](Ketone.md)s in place of [glucose]() also plays a huge role in [brain](Brain.md) disease prevention and management, especially since research has found that the [brain](Brain.md) loses its ability to metabolize [glucose]() as we age. Chronically fueling the [brain](Brain.md) with [glucose]() is one way to accelerate this. Like all [cell]()s in our body, the [cell]()s of the brain can develop [insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md), causing the [brain](Brain.md) to struggle to access fuel, thus forcing an energy crisis.

A starving [brain](Brain.md) is also not a healthy [brain](Brain.md). In fact, research has shown that [insulin resistance](Insulin%20resistance.md) is a common driver of [neurodegenerative disease]()s. [Alzheimer‚Äôs]() has recently been described as Type III [diabetes](Diabetes.md) because it is becoming evident that as we age, our [brain](Brain.md)‚Äôs ability to metabolize [glucose]() decreases. This can result in a slew of deficiencies that impair cognitive health. This and other indicators suggest that maybe our [brain](Brain.md) should not be only metabolizing [glucose]() for fuel, especially for extended periods of time.

Research in neurodegenerative individuals has even demonstrated that keto can improve aspects of [brain](Brain.md) function such as memory. This is because the [insulin resistant](Insulin%20resistance.md) brain can still metabolize [ketone](Ketone.md)s despite its inability to effectively utilize [glucose]().
