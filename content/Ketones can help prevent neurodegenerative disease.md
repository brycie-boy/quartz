## Ketones can help prevent  neurodegenerative disease  # 

The health benefits of metabolizing [[ketone]]s in place of [[glucose]] also plays a huge role in [[brain]] disease prevention and management, especially since research has found that the [[brain]] loses its ability to metabolize [[glucose]] as we age. Chronically fueling the [[brain]] with [[glucose]] is one way to accelerate this. Like all [[cell]]s in our body, the [[cell]]s of the brain can develop [[insulin resistance]], causing the [[brain]] to struggle to access fuel, thus forcing an energy crisis.

A starving [[brain]] is also not a healthy [[brain]]. In fact, research has shown that [[insulin resistance]] is a common driver of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s. [[Alzheimer‚Äôs]] has recently been described as Type III [[diabetes]] because it is becoming evident that as we age, our [[brain]]‚Äôs ability to metabolize [[glucose]] decreases. This can result in a slew of deficiencies that impair cognitive health. This and other indicators suggest that maybe our [[brain]] should not be only metabolizing [[glucose]] for fuel, especially for extended periods of time.

Research in neurodegenerative individuals has even demonstrated that keto can improve aspects of [[brain]] function such as memory. This is because the [[Insulin resistance|insulin resistant]] brain can still metabolize [[ketone]]s despite its inability to effectively utilize [[glucose]].
