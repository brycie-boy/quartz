## Intersectionality # 

Intersectionality an analytical framework developed by [[Kimberl√© Williams Crenshaw]] which examines how power relations are intertwined and mutually constructing. Race, class, gender, sexuality, dis/ability, ethnicity, nation, religion, and age are examples of categories of analysis, terms that reference important social divisions. But they are also categories that gain meaning from power relations of racism, sexism, heterosexism, and class exploitation.

In a 1989 essay, Crenshaw noted that a black woman‚Äôs experience in America is not captured by the summation of the black experience and the female experience. She made her point vividly by analyzing a legal case in which black women were victims of discrimination at General Motors even when the company could show that it hired plenty of black people (in factory jobs dominated by men) and plenty of women (in clerical jobs dominated by white people). So even though General Motors was found not to have discriminated against black people or women, it ended up hiring hardly any black women. Crenshaw‚Äôs important insight was that you can‚Äôt just look at a few big ‚Äúmain effects‚Äù of discrimination; you have to look at interactions, or ‚Äúintersections.‚Äù
