## The right hemisphere is responsible for the understanding of emotion in language

When it comes to the understanding (and expression) of emotion in language, again, despite [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) preponderance for language, the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is superior. Emotional language may be possible even when speech is lost through a [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) stroke. It is the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) that understands the emotional or the humorous aspect of a narrative. Memory for emotional language is in the right [hemisphere](). Ultimately there is clear evidence that when it comes to recognising emotion, whatever it may be, whether it is expressed in language or through facial expression, it is the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) on which we principally rely.
