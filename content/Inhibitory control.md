## Inhibitory control # 

Inhibitory control is an [[Executive functions|executive function]] that permits an individual to inhibit their immediate impulses and natural, [[habit]]ual, or dominant behavioral responses to stimuli in order to select a more appropriate behavior that is consistent with completing their goals. Current developmental taxonomies distinguish between [[response Inhibition]] and [[attentional Inhibition]]. The [[prefrontal cortex]], [[caudate nucleus]], and [[subthalamic nucleus]] are known to regulate inhibitory control cognition.
