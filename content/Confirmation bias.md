## Confirmation bias #🧠 

Confirmation bias is the tendency of the [[Idolatry|idolator]] to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports their prior views. It is the Prover proving what the Thinker thinks ([[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves]]). People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes.
