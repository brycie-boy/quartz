## Confirmation bias #🧠

Confirmation bias is the tendency of the [idolator](Idolatry.md) to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports their prior views. It is the Prover proving what the Thinker thinks ([What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves](What%20the%20Thinker%20thinks,%20the%20Prover%20proves.md)). People display this bias when they select information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes.
