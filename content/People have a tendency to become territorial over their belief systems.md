## People have a tendency to become territorial over their belief systems  #üß†

Human beings seem to be very unique primates, but primates nontheless. Specifically through the usual primate program of territory and property. Due to humans unique capacity to learn semantic systems, it becomes possible for them to "own" their favorite symbolic territories just as they would physical territory. Human beings battle not only over physical territory but also of these mental territories. 

If a donkey kicks a donkey, thats a matter between two donkeys, but if a Spaniard kicks the king of France, then all citizens who follow their countries local [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md) engage in the territorial frenzy known as "war." This will be preceeded by a great deal of signals such as "national honor," "an unforgivable outrage," "our duty to our nation," "cowardly appeasers who would crawl on their bellies," etc. etc. These "noises" are as "real" and meaningful to those in that [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md), as the "noises" of Beethoven's Ninth are "real" to those in the classical music [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md).
