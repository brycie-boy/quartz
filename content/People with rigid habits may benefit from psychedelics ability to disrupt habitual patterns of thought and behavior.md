## People with rigid habits may benefit from psychedelics ability to disrupt habitual patterns of thought and behavior

Perhaps psychological ‚Äúdisorders‚Äù characterized by exessive [low-entropy state](Low-entropy%20state.md)s are not the result of a lack of order in the [brain](Brain.md) but rather stem from an excess of order. When the grooves of self-reflective thinking deepen and harden, the [ego](Ego.md) becomes overbearing. This is perhaps most clearly evident in [depression](Depression.md), when the [ego](Ego.md) turns on itself and uncontrollable introspection gradually shades out reality. Research indicates that this debilitating state of mind (sometimes called heavy self-consciousness or depressive realism) may be the result of a hyperactive [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), which can trap us in destructive [ruminative response style](Ruminative%20response%20style.md)s that eventually close us off from the world outside. People suffering from a wide range of disorders characterized by excessively rigid patterns of thought‚Äîincluding [addiction](Addiction.md), obsessions, and eating disorders as well as [depression](Depression.md)‚Äîstand to benefit from the ability of [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s to disrupt stereotyped patterns of thought and behavior by disintegrating the patterns of neural activity upon which they rest.

So it may be that some [brain](Brain.md)s could stand to have a little more entropy, not less. This is where [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s come in. By quieting the [default mode network](Default%20mode%20network.md), these compounds can loosen the [ego](Ego.md)‚Äôs grip on the machinery of the mind, lubricating cognition where before it had been rusted stuck. [Psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s alter [consciousness](Consciousness.md) by disorganizing [brain](Brain.md) activity. They increase the amount of entropy in the [brain](Brain.md), with the result that the system reverts to a less constrained mode of cognition; a [high-entropy state](High-entropy%20state.md). It‚Äôs not just that one system drops away, but that an older system reemerges. That older system is primary [consciousness](Consciousness.md), a mode of thinking in which the [ego](Ego.md) temporarily loses its dominion and the [unconscious](), now unregulated, is brought into an observable space. This is the heuristic value of [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s to the study of the mind, though their may be therapeutic value as well.
