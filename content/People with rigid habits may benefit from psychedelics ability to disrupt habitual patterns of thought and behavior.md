## People with rigid habits may benefit from psychedelics ability to disrupt habitual patterns of thought and behavior # 

Perhaps psychological ‚Äúdisorders‚Äù characterized by excessive rigidity are not the result of a lack of order in the [[brain]] but rather stem from an excess of order. When the grooves of self-reflective thinking deepen and harden, the [[ego]] becomes overbearing. This is perhaps most clearly evident in [[depression]], when the [[ego]] turns on itself and uncontrollable introspection gradually shades out reality. Research indicates that this debilitating state of mind may be the result of a hyperactive [[default mode network]], which can trap us in destructive [[ruminative response style]]s that eventually close us off from the world outside. People suffering from a wide range of disorders characterized by excessively rigid patterns of thought‚Äîincluding [[addiction]], obsessions, and eating disorders as well as [[depression]]‚Äîstand to benefit from the ability of [[psychedelic]]s to disrupt stereotyped patterns of thought and behavior by disintegrating the patterns of neural activity upon which they rest.

So it may be that some [[brain]]s could stand to have a little more entropy, not less. This is where [[psychedelic]]s come in. By quieting the [[default mode network]], these compounds can loosen the [[ego]]‚Äôs grip on the machinery of the mind, lubricating cognition where before it had been rusted stuck. [[Psychedelic]]s alter [[consciousness]] by disorganizing [[brain]] activity. They increase the amount of entropy in the [[brain]], with the result that the system reverts to a less constrained mode of cognition. The [[ego]] temporarily loses its dominion and the [[unconscious]], now unregulated, is brought into an observable space. This is the heuristic value of [[psychedelic]]s to the study of the mind, though their may be therapeutic value as well.
