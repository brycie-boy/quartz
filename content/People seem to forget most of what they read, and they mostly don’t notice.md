## People seem to forget most of what they read, and they mostly don’t notice

It seems that most people can remember only a few high-level details of a book weeks later—if that. A typical reader might spend hours finishing some serious non-fiction—then maybe it comes up at a dinner party, and they find you can remember like three sentences. Basically no detailed recall. Barely the gist! What’s more: people seem surprised when this happens. They seem to consistently overestimate how much they’re absorbing from a book. Perhaps this is because of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](Dunning-Kruger%20effect.md).
