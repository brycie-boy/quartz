## Holy Writ fallacy #‚è≥

In the 19th century, [Thomas Aquinas]() thought he had an infallible method of arriving at certitude ‚Äî a combination of [Pure Reason](Pure%20Reason.md) and Holy Writ, a writing or utterance that has unquestionable authority. This is still believed in some backward countries, but is not generally accepted in civilized nations because [Pure Reason](Pure%20Reason.md) itself has been proven fallible (see [Pure Reason fallacy]()) and because there are many varieties of Holy Writ around ‚Äî and there is no known empirical test to determine which Holy Writ is the "real" Holy Writ.
