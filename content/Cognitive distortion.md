## Cognitive distortion

In [cognitive behavioral therapy](Cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy.md), a cognitive distortion is an exaggerated or irrational thought pattern involved in the onset or perpetuation of psycho-pathological states, such as [depression](Depression.md) and [anxiety](). Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality "inaccurately." According to¬†[Aaron Beck]()'s cognitive model, a negative outlook on reality is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns reinforce negative emotions and thoughts. Some refute this to always be the case (see [depressive realism](Depressive%20realism.md)).
