## Existential vacuum

The existential vacuum is what [Viktor Frankl]() called the feeling of the total and ultimate meaninglessness of ones life of which so many people complain today. They lack the awareness of a meaning worth living for. They are haunted by the experience of their inner emptiness, a void within themselves. Frankl gives the ‚ÄúSunday neurosis" as an example. This is that kind of [depression](Depression.md) which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest. Frankl claims that such widespread phenomena as [depression](Depression.md), aggression and [addiction](Addiction.md) are not understandable unless we recognize the existential vacuum underlying them. This is also true of the crises of pensioners and aging people. This is also true of the crises of pensioners and aging people.
