## Aerobic exercises requiring coordination are better for learning

In order to improve learning, it‚Äôs important to mix in some form of activity in your aerobic routine that demands coordination. Greenough worked on an experiment several years ago in which running rats were compared to others that were taught complex motor skills, such as walking across balance beams, unstable objects, and elastic rope ladders. After two weeks of training, the acrobatic rats had a 35 percent increase of [BDNF](BDNF.md) in the [cerebellum](Cerebellum.md), whereas the running rats had none in that area.
