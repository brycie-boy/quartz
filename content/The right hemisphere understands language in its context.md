## The right hemisphere understands language in its context

The fact that [the right hemisphere sees things in their context](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20things%20in%20their%20context.md) is particularly important when it comes to what the two hemispheres contribute to language. The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) takes whatever is said within its entire context. It is specialized in pragmatics, the art of contextual understanding of meaning, and in using metaphor. It is the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) which processes the non-literal aspects of language. This is why the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is not good at understanding the higher level meaning of utterances such as ‘it's a bit hot in here today’ (while the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) understands ‘please open a window’, the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) assumes this is just helpful supply of meteorological data). It is also why the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) underpins the appreciation of humor, since humor depends vitally on being able to understand the context of what is said and done, and how context changes it. Subjects with [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) damage, like subjects with [schizophrenia](), who in many respects resemble them, cannot understand implied meaning, and tend to take conversational remarks literally.
