## Classical conditioning

Classical conditioning is a behavioral procedure in which a biologically potent physiological stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a neutral stimulus (e.g. the sound of a bell). As the association solidifies, is the ringing bell still “just” a marker symbolizing impending pleasure, or does it become pleasurable itself? Elegant work related to the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md) shows that in a substantial subset of rats, the arbitrary signal itself becomes rewarding. 

Classical conditioning is distinct from [operant conditioning](Operant%20conditioning.md) through which the strength of a *voluntary* behavior is modified, , either by reinforcement or by punishment, however, classical conditioning can affect operant conditioning; that classically conditioned stimuli can reinforce operant responses.
