## Jump out of the system

Jumping out of the system refers to an inherent property of intelligence in which it can jump out of the task which it is performing, and survey what it has done; it is always looking for and often finding patterns. This is something a conventional machine is incapable of: [Humans differ from machines in that they are able to make observations about their own behavior](Humans%20differ%20from%20machines%20in%20that%20they%20are%20able%20to%20make%20observations%20about%20their%20own%20behavior.md).

For example, a human being who is reading a book may grow sleepy. Instead of continuing to read until the book is finished he is just as likely to put the book aside and turn off the light. He has stepped "out of the system" and yet it seems the most natural thing in the world to us.

Or, suppose person A is watching television when person B comes in the room, and shows evident displeasure with the situation Person A may think he understands the problem, and try to remedy it by exiting the present system (that television program), and flipping the channel knob, looking for a better show. Person B may have a more radio concept of what it is to  "exit the system"—namely to turn the television off.

Of course, there are cases where only a rare individual will have the vision to perceive a system which governs many peoples lives, a system which has never before even been recognized as a system; then such people often devote their lives to convincing other people that the system really is there and that it ought to be exited from!
