## Capitalism  # 

Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the [[means of production]] and their operation for profit. Central characteristics of capitalism include [[capital]] accumulation, [[competition (economics)|competitive market]]s, price system, [[private property]], property rights recognition, voluntary exchange, and wage labor. In a market economy decision-making and investments are determined by owners of wealth, property, or ability to maneuver [[capital]] or production ability in [[capital]] and financial markets—whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.
