## Psychopathy  # 

Psychopathy is a [[personality disorder]] characterized by: 

- _Arrogant and deceitful interpersonal style_: impression management or superficial charm, inflated and grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological lying/deceit, and manipulation for personal gain.
- _Deficient affective experience_: lack of remorse or guilt, shallow affect (coldness and unemotionality), callousness and lack of empathy, and failure to accept responsibility for own actions.
- _Impulsive and irresponsible lifestyle_: impulsivity, sensation-seeking and risk-taking, irresponsible and unreliable behavior, financially parasitic lifestyle and lack of realistic, long-term goals.

Neurologically, it has been linked primarily impairments in the right [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] and right [[orbitofrontal cortex]], as well as reduced connections between the [[amygdala]] and the right [[orbitofrontal cortex]]. Note that [[the strength of the connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex determines a person‚Äôs level of emotional reactivity]].
