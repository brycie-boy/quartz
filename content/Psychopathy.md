## Psychopathy

Psychopathy is a [personality disorder]() characterized by: 

* boldness
* superficial charm
* inclination to manipulate
* lack of empathy and remorse
* self-absorption
* impulsivity

Neurologically, it has been linked primarily impairments in the [ventromedial prefrontal cortex](Ventromedial%20prefrontal%20cortex.md) and [orbitofrontal cortex](Orbitofrontal%20cortex.md), as well as reduced connections between the [amygdala](Amygdala.md) and the right [orbitofrontal cortex](Orbitofrontal%20cortex.md). Note that [the strength of the connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex determines a person‚Äôs level of emotional reactivity](The%20strength%20of%20the%20connections%20between%20the%20amygdala%20and%20the%20prefrontal%20cortex%20determines%20a%20person%E2%80%99s%20level%20of%20emotional%20reactivity.md).
