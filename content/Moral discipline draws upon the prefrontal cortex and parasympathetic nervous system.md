## Moral discipline draws upon the prefrontal cortex and parasympathetic nervous system

Moral Discipline in [The Nobel Eightfold Path](The%20Nobel%20Eightfold%20Path.md) involves regulating your actions, words, and thoughts to create benefits rather than harms for yourself and others. In your [brain](Brain.md), this draws on top-down direction from the [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md). Moral Discipline also relies on bottom-up calming from the [parasympathetic nervous system](Parasympathetic%20nervous%20system.md) and positive emotions from the [Limbic system](Limbic%20system.md). Moral Discipline relies heavily on regulation, both to excite positive inclinations and to inhibit negative ones.
