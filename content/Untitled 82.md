(I'm responding so late cuz https://discord.com/channels/572330844056715284/572337747130580993/1225250247798820975) I did reference Anatomy of an Epidemic. Here's some relevant notes of mine. Plz educate me if i'm wrong on anything here. I don't wanna mislead. I decided not to write this out into messages cuz it would be too long and clog up chat. Also where's your sources for https://discord.com/channels/572330844056715284/572337747130580993/1224963122343710761?

I'm still gathering data on how mindfulness improves executive function. I've only read and annotated my sources so far. I have yet to write notes on those annotations. These are those sources if you want to read them:

- [Pubmed - Neural mechanisms of attentional control in mindfulness meditation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3563089/)
- [Pubmed - ADHD and attentional control: Impaired segregation of task positive and task negative brain networks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130439/) 
    - The task negative network is also called the Default Mode Network and [real-time FMRI of meditators showed decreased default mode network activity when concentrated](https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/Real-time-FMRI-of-meditators-showed-decreased-default-mode-network-activity-when-concentrated)
- [Research Gate - Enhanced Response Inhibition During Intensive Meditation Training Predicts Improvements in Self-Reported Adaptive Socioemotional Functioning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51058702_Enhanced_Response_Inhibition_During_Intensive_Meditation_Training_Predicts_Improvements_in_Self-Reported_Adaptive_Socioemotional_Functioning)
- [Meditation, mindfulness and cognitive flexibility](https://web.colby.edu/cogblog/files/2014/05/Moore-Malinowski-2009-.pdf)
- [Pubmed - Mindfulness training improves working memory capacity and GRE performance while reducing mind wandering](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23538911/)
- I can't find which one talks about cognitive inhibition but it's a [literature note](https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/Nebula) so i'll find it eventually

- "next time ping mods when someone makes some headass medical claim please and thankx. glad mindfulness and to do lists and pulling urself up by ur bootstraps(which is *actually* ableist rhetoric btw)worked for u bryc33b01! you probably shouldnt have been on stimulants because you dont have adhd!!!"
    - Do you mean ping mods to ban me? Instead of banning me, why not just correct me? Shouldn't be so hard if i'm so obviously wrong. I also have a literal diagnosis of ADHD. And i resonate with that diagnosis. I'm speaking from personal experience. For example when i first tried implementing a reading routine i could hardly do it. Now its way easier than it used to be. Also before you accuse me of using an ablist rhetoric, no where in my message did i say to "pull yourself by your own bootstraps." I'm not sure what you mean by that anyways
- "Neural circuitry *is* neural chemistry, my guy. All "circuitry" in the human body  (neurons specifically) works that way. 

   ADHD (and "overcoming it") isnt nearly as simple as you're putting it. Like, at *all*. Executive dysfunction is only one facet--not to mention emotional dysregulation, reduced region volume, etc, etc."
    - I'm referring to synaptic strength and density. I should've said structural. And that's increased through use is it not? i should of said "structural." Executive functions are also just one example. Also what do you mean by "regional volume?" Idk much about regional volume all i know is you have reduced volume in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. It would be nice to find more neural correlates to ADHD that i can add to my notes. Even if chemical imbalance was involved, couldn't such practices improve those structural impairments and help alleviate the symptoms which they contribute to?
- "Sun tzu, please for the love of GOD do not take medical advice from strangers in the offtopic general chat. And dont let them scare you regarding your prescribed medication use either."
    - Yeah definitely talk to your doctor about it i'm just a guy. It's not intended to be medical advice. Nor was i trying to scare anyone into suddenly stopping their treatment. I'm only trying to encourage skepticism and prompt further research. Nobody should decide to quit until they're especially certain about whether they should. You'd be pretty stupid to do otherwise. 
    - I never said to just take my word for it blindly. I don't think people should have that attitude toward anybody, including their doctors. If they happen to be skeptical of something they should entertain that skepticism. That's how society progresses. Either way the data does the talking and not the doctors qualifications
- Yeah here it is https://discord.com/channels/249840691973324802/300476980501938178/1183901358261285016 but that's not what i'm saying at all
- "I think you're mixing up the chemical imbalance theory and the disease model of mental health (the latter of which is, in fact, dogshit)"
     - can you elaborate plz?
- "Who's going to tell him ADHD meds are actually neuroprotective when used properly?"
    - I guess you? I wasn't aware of that notion. Plz link the study
- Also idk why you guys had to be so antagonistic about it as if I didn't have good intentions
- Idk why leftists are so supportive of a doctrine that justifies and perpetuates capitalism and oppression. Some mental illnesses seem to me to be a pretty appropriate emotional responses to the kind of environment we live in. ADHD is _somewhat_ different tho. Gabor Mate links it to emotional neglect during infancy and childhood(see Hungry Ghosts and Scattered Minds). But environment is still playing a role here. And it's easy to do this in a day in age where both parents have to work and are coming home stressed. Genetic determinism strips all environmental context
