Yeah i can. Don't take my word for it. Look into it for yourself. Plz educate me if i'm wrong i don't want to mislead. Here's some notes of mine. I decided not to write this out into messages in here cuz it would be too long and clog up chat:

- [Psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on subjective judgement rather than empirical tests]()
    - Ever wonder why they don't test you for a mental disorder?
- [The claim that ADHD is caused by low dopamine levels is a drug-marketing claim with little evidence]()
- [An overabundance of dopamine in schizophrenics has yet to be found]()
- [A shortage of serotonin in the brain has not yet been found in depression patients]()
- [The brain adapts to psychotropic drugs by increasing or decreasing neurotransmitter production and receptor density]()
- [Amphetamines are known to induce psychotic and manic episodes]()
- [There are many reports of children experiencing psychosis during stimulant treatment for ADHD]()
- [Stimulant treatment causes patients to cycle through arousal and dysphoric states on a daily basis]()
- [The symptoms of stimulant treatment for ADHD closely resemble those of bipolar disorder]()
- [Long-term administration of antidepressants in children show risk for the development of bipolar disorder]()
- [A majority of bipolar cases were shown to be preceded by stimulant or antidepressant]()
- I'm still gathering data on how mindfulness improves executive function. I've only read and annotated my sources so far. I have yet to write notes on those annotations. These are those sources if you want to read them:
    - [Pubmed - Neural mechanisms of attentional control in mindfulness meditation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3563089/)
    - [Pubmed - ADHD and attentional control: Impaired segregation of task positive and task negative brain networks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130439/) 
        - The task negative network is also called the Defualt Mode Network and [real-time FMRI of meditators showed decreased default mode network activity when concentrated]()
    - [Research Gate - Enhanced Response Inhibition During Intensive Meditation Training Predicts Improvements in Self-Reported Adaptive Socioemotional Functioning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51058702_Enhanced_Response_Inhibition_During_Intensive_Meditation_Training_Predicts_Improvements_in_Self-Reported_Adaptive_Socioemotional_Functioning)
    - [Meditation, mindfulness and cognitive flexibility](https://web.colby.edu/cogblog/files/2014/05/Moore-Malinowski-2009-.pdf)
    - [Pubmed - Mindfulness training improves working memory capacity and GRE performance while reducing mind wandering](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23538911/)
    - I can't find which one talks about cognitive inhibition but it's a [literature note] so i'll find it eventually 
- "next time ping mods when someone makes some headass medical claim please and thankx. glad mindfulness and to do lists and pulling urself up by ur bootstraps(which is *actually* ableist rhetoric btw)worked for u bryc33b01! you probably shouldnt have been on stimulants because you dont have adhd!!!"
    - Do you mean ping mods to ban me? Plz don't ban me for that and just correct me. I have a literal diagnosis of ADHD that i resonate with so that's kinda invalidating. It sucks to deal with. Im speaking from personal experience. For example when i first tried implementing a reading routine i could hardly do it. Now its way easier than it used to be
    - Also before you accuse me of using an ablist rhetoric, no where in my message did i say to "pull yourself by your own bootstraps." Idrk what you mean by that anyways
- "Neural circuitry *is* neural chemistry, my guy. All "circuitry" in the human body  (neurons specifically) works that way. 

   ADHD (and "overcoming it") isnt nearly as simple as you're putting it. Like, at *all*. Executive dysfunction is only one facet--not to mention emotional dysregulation, reduced region volume, etc, etc."
    - You know what i mean by "neural circuitry" based on what i said afterwords. I'm referring to synaptic strength and density. And that's increased through use is it not? Maybe i should of said structural" or something. Also executive functions are just one example. Also what do you mean by "regional volume?" Idk much about regional volume all i know is you have reduced volume in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. It would be nice to find more neural correlates to ADHD that i can add to my notes
- "Sun tzu, please for the love of GOD do not take medical advice from strangers in the offtopic general chat. And dont let them scare you regarding your prescribed medication use either."
    - Yeah definitely talk to your doctor about it i'm just a guy. It's not medical advice. Nor was i trying to scare anyone into stopping their treatment. I'm only prompting further research. I never said to just take my word for it. I don't think people should do that for anybody, including their doctors. If they happen to be skeptical of something they should entertain that skepticism. Either way the data does the talking and not the doctors qualifications
    - Tbh you could apply these practices to your life _while_ taking mads and quit them when ever _you_ want to
- Yeah here it is https://discord.com/channels/249840691973324802/300476980501938178/1183901358261285016 but that's not what i'm saying at all
- "I think you're mixing up the chemical imbalance theory and the disease model of mental health (the latter of which is, in fact, dogshit)"
     - can you elaborate?
- "Who's going to tell him ADHD meds are actually neuroprotective when used properly?"
    - Plz link the study that shows meth can have neuroprotective effects. If that's the case then i'm hopping on that shit
- Also idk why you guys had to be so antagonistic about it as if I didn't have good intentions
- Idk why leftists are so supportive of a doctrine that justifies and perpetuates capitalism and oppression
