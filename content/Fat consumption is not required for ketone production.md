## Fat consumption is not required for ketone production

Contrary to common belief, the consumption of [fat]() is not required for [ketone](Ketone.md) production. This is because there is a difference between the fat that we eat and the fat in our body. [Ketone](Ketone.md)s are made with stored [fat]() (with the exception of [MCT]()s). The [fat]() that we eat gets absorbed in our digestive tract and packaged into little carriers known as [chylomicron]()s. [Chylomicron]()s travel through our bloodstream and are roped in by [muscle]() and [adipose tissue]() where they can then dump off the [fatty acid]()s they are carrying into [cell]()s to be used for energy or stored for later use. 

However, [chylomicron]()s only go to the [liver]() to be disposed of after they have dumped their [fatty acid]()s, meaning they are not able to deliver significant amounts of dietary [fat]() to the [liver]() for [ketone](Ketone.md) production. That means that the [fat]() we eat will preferentially be used for energy by our [tissue]()s and not for [ketone](Ketone.md) production. Thus eating more fat will not get your [ketone](Ketone.md)s higher or that it is necessary to be in a state of ketosis.
