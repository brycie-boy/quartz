[A stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life](A%20stressful%20childhood%20can%20result%20in%20an%20overactive%20stress%20response%20in%20later%20life.md). If this initial [Imprint](Imprint.md) of the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) is negative‚Äîif the universe in general and other humans in particular are [imprint](Imprint.md)ed as dangerous, hostile and frightening, [the Prover](What%20the%20Thinker%20thinks,%20the%20Prover%20proves.md) will go on throughout life adjusting all perceptions to fit this map. This is what is known as ‚ÄúInjustice Collector‚Äù syndrome. The female members of this [imprint](Imprint.md) group become Radical Feminists; the male members are less organized and can be found in fringe groups of the far Left and far Right.
