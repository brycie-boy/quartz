## A negative imprint of the limbic system leads one to see everything as dangerous, hostile and frightening # 

[[A stressful childhood can result in an overactive stress response in later life]]. The universe in general and other humans in particular are also [[imprint]]ed as dangerous, hostile and frightening, and [[What the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves|the Prover]] will go on throughout life adjusting all perceptions to fit this map. This is what is known as “Injustice Collector” syndrome. The female members of this [[imprint]] group become Radical Feminists; the male members are less organized and can be found in fringe groups of the far Left and far Right.
