## Samsara #⏳

In Buddhism, Samsara is the continuous cycle of repeated [rebirth](Rebirth.md), mundane existence, and death without a disernable beginning or end. It is described as a pointless wandering from one life to the next with no paticular direction. This  wandering is perpetauted by [the taints](The%20taints.md).
