## Being self-reliant means living in the present and not relying on previous authority's

People today are timid and apologetic. They do not dare say "*I* think" or "*I* am" but instead quotes someone else. Rather than timidly looking to the past, people would be better off looking to nature to understand how to conduct themsleves. A blade of grass, the rose bud, the leaf bud, and the root are all complete without reference to others of its kind, and they live always is the present. But [people generally live ruminating the past or anticipating the future rather than enjoying the present moment](People%20generally%20live%20ruminating%20the%20past%20or%20anticipating%20the%20future%20rather%20than%20enjoying%20the%20present%20moment.md). The individual will never achieve happiness unless they also live only in the present and reject the notion of time. This approach should be completely obvious, but conventional morality leads people to instead turn to some authority outside of themselves.
