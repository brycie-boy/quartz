## Intelligent mode

In intelligent mode, we are observant of our behavior and are able to [jump out of the system](Jump%20out%20of%20the%20system.md). We can perform [high-temperature search](High-temperature%20search.md)es; we are allowed to do whatever our intelligence suggests, and can modify the rules of the system to see what that gives. I believe Intelligent mode is characteristic of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) since [the right hemisphere allows for flexibility in thought and behavior](The%20right%20hemisphere%20allows%20for%20flexibility%20in%20thought%20and%20behavior.md), and [the right hemisphere is able to access and hold larger quantities of information](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20able%20to%20access%20and%20hold%20larger%20quantities%20of%20information.md).
