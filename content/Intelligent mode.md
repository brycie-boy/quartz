## Intelligent mode #🧠 

[[We generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs]]. In intelligent mode, however, we _are_ conscious of our behavior and are able to [[jump out of the system]]. We are allowed to do whatever our intelligence suggests, and can modify the rules of the system to see what that gives.

- [[The right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior]]
- [[Those with impairments in the right frontolimbic regions have trouble with stopping whatever they're currently doing]]
- [[The right hemisphere sees the whole first, and then the left hemisphere separates it into parts]]
