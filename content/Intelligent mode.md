## Intelligent mode #🧠

[We generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs](We%20generally%20struggle%20to%20examine%20and%20criticize%20our%20own%20neural%20programs.md). In intelligent mode, however, we *are* conscious of our behavior and are able to [jump out of the system](Jump%20out%20of%20the%20system.md). We are allowed to do whatever our intelligence suggests, and can modify the rules of the system to see what that gives.
