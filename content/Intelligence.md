## Intelligence

Intelligence has been deifined in many ways: the capacity for abstaction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.

Characteristics of intelligence include the ability: to respond to situations flexibly; to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances; to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages; to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation; to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them; to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them; to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways; to come up with ideas which are novel.
