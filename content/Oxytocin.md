## Oxytocin # 

Oxytocin is a [[peptide hormone]] and [[neuropeptide]] normally produced by the [[Hypothalamus]] and released by the [[pituitary gland]]. In humans it plays roles in behavior that include social bonding, reproduction, childbirth, and period after childbirth. Not only does it induce labor but also affects a mother‚Äôs moods and promotes her physical and emotional nurturing of infants. In mammals of both sexes oxytocin also contributes to orgasmic pleasure and, more generally, may be considered one of the ‚Äúlove hormones.‚Äù Just like [[opioid peptide]]s, oxytocin can reduce separation anxiety when infused into distressed young animals. It is critical to our experience of loving attachments and even to maintaining committed relationships.

The [[brain]]‚Äôs fault lines dividing [[In-group and out-group]] are shown by oxytocin. The [[hormone]] prompts trust, generosity, and cooperation toward [[In-group and out-group|in-groups]] but crappier behavior toward [[In-group and out-group|out-groups]]‚Äîmore preemptive aggression in economic play, more advocacy of sacrificing Them (but not Us) for the greater good. oxytocin exaggerates [[In-group and out-group|Us/Them-ing]]. This is hugely interesting. If you like broccoli but spurn cauliflower, no [[hormone]] amplifies both preferences. Ditto for liking chess and disdaining backgammon. Oxytocin‚Äôs opposing effects on [[In-group and out-group|Us and Them]] demonstrate the salience of such dichotomizing.
