## Chronic cortisol exposer reduces cortisol receptors in the amygdala and weakens the prefronal cortex #üß†

The more [cortisol](Cortisol.md) the [amygdala](Amygdala.md) is exposed to, the fewer [cortisol](Cortisol.md) [receptor](Receptor.md)s in the [amygdala](Amygdala.md) and the more likelihood that your [amygdala](Amygdala.md) will do the talking from here on. Also, [the frontal cortex is equally vulnerable to shrinkage from cortisol as the hippocampus](The%20frontal%20cortex%20is%20equally%20vulnerable%20to%20shrinkage%20from%20cortisol%20as%20the%20hippocampus.md). Chronic stress day by day weakens your [prefrontal cortex](Prefrontal%20cortex.md) to the point where the [amygdala](Amygdala.md) becomes the new head of the [brain](Brain.md) and then you just react to the slightest provocation without any thought of the consequences.
