Post in r/science:

In Paul Stamets book Mycelium Running, he states that the "architecture of mycelium resembles patterns predicted in string theory, and astrophysicists theorize that the most energy-conserving forms in the universe will be organized as threads of matterenergy. The arrangement of these strings resembles the architecture of mycelium." Im interested in the idea that web like structures conserve energy and i want to find more on this. He did not include a citation for this claim unfortunately
