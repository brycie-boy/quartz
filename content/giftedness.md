## giftedness  # 

- **Intellectual giftedness** is an [intellectual ability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence "Intelligence") significantly higher than average.
- Generally, gifted or advanced students learn more quickly, deeply, and broadly than their peers. They may talk early, learn to read early, and progress at the same level as normal children who are significantly older. Gifted students also tend to demonstrate high reasoning ability, [creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity "Creativity"), [curiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity "Curiosity"), a large [vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary "Vocabulary"), and an excellent [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory"). They can often master concepts with few repetitions. They may also be [perfectionistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology) "Perfectionism (psychology)"), and frequently question authority. Some have trouble relating to or communicating with their peers because of disparities in vocabulary size (especially in the early years), personality, interests, and [motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation "Motivation"). As children, they may prefer the company of older children or adults.
