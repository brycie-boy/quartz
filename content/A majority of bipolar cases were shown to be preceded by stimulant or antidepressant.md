## A majority of bipolar cases were shown to be preceded by stimulant or antidepressant # 

[[Stimulant treatment causes patients to cycle through arousal and dysphoric states on a daily basis]], and [[the symptoms of stimulant treatment for ADHD closely resemble those of bipolar disorder]]. Also, [[long-term administration of antidepressants in children show risk for the development of bipolar disorder]]. 

In a 2003 study of seventy-nine juvenile [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] patients, University of Louisville psychiatrist [[Rif El-Mallakh]] determined that forty-nine (62 percent) had been treated with a [[stimulant]] or an [[antidepressant]] prior to becoming [[mania|manic]].  That same year, [[Papolos]] reported that 83 percent of the 195 [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] children he studied had been diagnosed with some other psychiatric illness first, and that two-thirds had been exposed to an [[antidepressant]]. Finally, [[Gianni Faedda]] found that 84 percent of the children treated for [[bipolar disorder]] at the Luci Bini Mood Disorders Clinic in New York City between 1998 and 2000 had been previously exposed to psychiatric drugs. ‚ÄúStrikingly, in fewer than 10% [of the cases] was diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]] considered initially,‚Äù Faedda wrote.
