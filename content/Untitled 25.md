- Who is the master who makes the grass green?
- Perhaps grass is not objectively green, but is only so due to the realtionship between grass, light, and the human nervous system
- much of what you see “out there” is actually manufactured “in here” by your [[brain]]
- There is always time, however small, between [[sense impression]] and the perception in our [[brain]]s. In that time, the [[brain]] imposes form, color, meaning, and a great deal else
- Our minds will organize all of our perceptions to fit our expectations and desires
- our emic realities are programmed by our expectations
- You set up the expectation, and then we notice the 23s more than ordinary numbers
- there seems to no escape from an at least a partial [[model agnosticism]] and a recognition that all ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferitial
- You have achieved Discordian enlightenment when you realize that, while the goddess Eris and the Law of Fives are not literally true, neither is anything else.

Awesome book. Its a biography of blake and an analysis of his thought using neuroscience, quantum physics, and even leary's eight circuits. I give it the cyb3r stamp of approval
