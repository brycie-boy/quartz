## We ordinarily perceive reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments

Ordinarily, we represent the world to ourselves through the refractory prism of [subjective bias](Subjective%20bias.md)es and [confirmation bias](Confirmation%20bias.md) which are shaped by [craving](Craving.md) and [clinging](Clinging.md) (which they in turn reinforce). [Our brains unconsciously focus on only a select few of the sensory signals it receives that it considers important](Our%20brains%20unconsciously%20focus%20on%20only%20a%20select%20few%20of%20the%20sensory%20signals%20it%20receives%20that%20it%20considers%20important.md), and we tend to see only the things that we want to see; and we tune out the things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, and throw into question the comforting assumptions about ourselves and our [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md). We spend much of our lives mindlessly and reflexively reacting to our [subjective bias](Subjective%20bias.md)es, loosing sight of the changes in our selves and our environment. To undo this process requires a commitment to truth that is initially unsettling but in the end proves liberating and exhilarating.
