## We ordinarily perceive reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments # 

Ordinarily, we represent the world to ourselves through a refractory prism of [[subjective bias]]es shaped by [[craving]] and [[clinging]] (which they in turn reinforce). We tend to see only the things that we want to see; and we tune out the things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, and throw into question the comforting assumptions about ourselves and our [[reality tunnel]]. We spend much of our lives mindlessly and reflexively reacting to our [[subjective bias]]es, loosing sight of the changes in our selves and our environment.
