## Every conspiracy regards itself as an affinity group

Every conspiracy regards itself as an affinity group—men and women who share the same goals and work together well. When you and I do it, it is just an affinity group. When that gang over there does it, it is a damnable conspiracy. True conspiracy does exist when a group conceals evidence, spreads deliberate misinformation and coerces or terrorizes witnesses. Any affinity group approaches such behavior to the extent that memebers reinforce each other's paricipation in the group [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md), especially concerning such crucial matters such as what is important enough to notice and discuss against what is trivial and better ignored. How coercive do we have to be to intimidate witnesses? Most people, as [the SNAFU principle](The%20SNAFU%20principle.md) expains, are easlily led to report what an authority figure wants to hear.
