## We generally struggle with the idea that two contradictory positions can be true

Rationally, we struggle with the notion that two contrary positions can both be true. Traditional logic tells us that this is an either/or situation. The idea that the earth is flat, for example, and the idea that the earth is round, are contradictory statements that can‚Äôt both be true. It must be one or the other, and we are usually pretty sure we know which.
