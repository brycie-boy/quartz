## We feel more positively towards people who share minimal traits with us # 

The power of minimal, arbitrary groupings to elicit [[In-group and out-group|Us/Them-ing]] is like ‚Äúgreen-beard effects." These hover between prosociality due to kin selection and due to reciprocal altruism‚Äîthey require an arbitrary, conspicuous, [[gene]]tically based trait (e.g., a green beard) that indicates a tendency to act altruistically toward other green-bearders‚Äîunder those conditions, green-bearders flourish. Us/Them-ing based on minimal shared traits is like psychological rather than [[gene]]tic green-beard effects. We feel positive associations with people who share the most meaningless traits with us.

As a great example, in one study subjects conversed with a researcher who, unbeknownst to them, did or didn‚Äôt mimic their movements (for example, leg crossing). Not only is mimicry pleasing, activating [[dopamine]] release, but it also made subjects more likely to help the researcher, picking up their dropped pen. An unconscious [[In-group and out-group|Us-ness]] born from someone slouching in a chair like you do. Thus an invisible strategy becomes yoked to an arbitrary green-beard marker.
