## Ordinary waking consciousness is more firm than other conscious states because of a continual process of reality testing

If [the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input](The%20brain's%20perceptual%20systems%20actively%20and%20pre-consciously%20interpret%20and%20edit%20their%20input.md), how is normal waking [consciousness](Consciousness.md) any different from other, seemingly less faithful productions of our imagination‚Äîsuch as dreams or psychotic delusions or [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md) trips? In fact, all these states of [consciousness](Consciousness.md) are ‚Äúimagined‚Äù: they‚Äôre mental constructs that weave together some news of the world with priors of various kinds. But in the case of normal waking [consciousness](Consciousness.md), the handshake between the data of our senses and our preconceptions is especially firm. That‚Äôs because [the left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md), which subjects us to a continual process of reality testing, as when you reach out to confirm the existence of the object in your visual field or, upon waking from a nightmare, consult your memory to see if you really did show up to teach a class without any clothes on. Unlike these other states of consciousness, ordinary waking [consciousness](Consciousness.md) has been optimized by natural selection to best facilitate our everyday survival.

Indeed, that feeling of transparency we associate with ordinary [consciousness](Consciousness.md) may owe more to familiarity and [habit](Habit.md) than it does to verisimilitude. [Because perception is not absolute, our models of reality are all somewhat conjectural and inferential](Because%20perception%20is%20not%20absolute,%20our%20models%20of%20reality%20are%20all%20somewhat%20conjectural%20and%20inferential.md). If it were possible to temporarily experience another person‚Äôs mental state, it would probably feel more like a [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md) state than a ‚Äònormal‚Äô state, because of its massive disparity with whatever mental state is [habit](Habit.md)ual with you. Another trippy thought experiment is to try to imagine the world as it appears to a creature with an entirely different sensory apparatus and way of life. You quickly realize there is no single reality out there waiting to be faithfully and comprehensively transcribed.
