## Govenrment secrecy has manifested itself because of a complex legal framework for classification that is increasingly being ignored  # 

Another way govenrment secrecy has manifested itself is that it is being exerted to an extreme degree. The US has a complex legal framework for classification that is increasingly being ignored. The executive branch abuses its state secrets privilage  to keep information out of public view. The executive branch keeps secrets from Congress. The NSA keeps secrets from those who oversee its operations‚Äîincluding Congress. Certain members of Congress keep secrets from the rest of Congress. Secret courts keep their own secrets. And even the Supreme Court is increasingly keeping its own documents secret. In Washington, knowledge is currency, and the intellegence community is hoarding it.
