## Mendelian inheritance

[Gregor Mendel](), an Austrian monk, had shown through experiments with 30,000 pea plants that inherited physical characteristics were regularly controlled by a pair of elements (or [gene]()s), with both the “male” and “female” parent (or part of the plant) contributing a [gene](). In plants, such physical characteristics might include size, color, and texture. In many instances, one [gene]() type was dominant over the other. A “tall” [gene]() for the height of a plant might be dominant over a “short” [gene](), and thus a combination of tall-and-short [gene]()s for height would produce a tall plant, although that plant could now pass on a short [gene]() to its offspring. If another tall plant did the same, a short plant would result.
