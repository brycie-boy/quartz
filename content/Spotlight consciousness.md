## Spotlight consciousness

Spotlight [consciousness](Consciousness.md) is a [low-entropy state](Low-entropy%20state.md) that gives people the ability to narrowly focus attention on a goal. It is the domain of the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), as [the right hemisphere has broad, global attention, while the left has narrow attention](The%20right%20hemisphere%20has%20broad,%20global%20attention,%20while%20the%20left%20has%20narrow%20attention.md). The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) directs the spotlight of its attention where it will and then relies on [predictive coding](Predictive%20coding.md) to interpret what it perceives. This is the default conscious state of adults, as children experience more of [lantern consciousness](Lantern%20consciousness.md).
