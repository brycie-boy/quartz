## Sublation # 

- imagination: [[The imagination can be considered godlike because it is a place where something new can come from nothing]]
- In Hegelian philosophy, sublation refers to **the situation where a thesis and antithesis interact, where a term or concept is both preserved and changed through its dialectical interplay with another term or concept**
- Nothing is completely original. It is always inspired. But something creative always involves at least some novel quality. Thus it preserves what came before but also brings something new
