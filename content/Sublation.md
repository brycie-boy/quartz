## Sublation

* imagination: [The imagination can be considered godlike because it is a place where something new can come from nothing](The%20imagination%20can%20be%20considered%20godlike%20because%20it%20is%20a%20place%20where%20something%20new%20can%20come%20from%20nothing.md)
* In Hegelian philosophy, sublation refers to **the situation where a thesis and antithesis interact, where a term or concept is both preserved and changed through its dialectical interplay with another term or concept**
* Nothing is completely original. It is always inspired. But something creative always involves at least some novel quality. Thus it preserves what came before but also brings something new
