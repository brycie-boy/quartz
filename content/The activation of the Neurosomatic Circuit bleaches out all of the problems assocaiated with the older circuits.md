## The activation of the Neurosomatic Circuit bleaches out all of the problems assocaiated with the older circuits  # 

In general, [[Socio-Sexual Circuit]] problems take the form of guilt; “I cannot do what I am supposed to do.” [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|Semantic Circuit]] problems take the form of perplexity; “I cannot understand how I got into this mess, or how to get out of it, or what is expected of me,” etc. [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]]problems take the form of bullying or cowardice: “I will force them, or I will surrender and let them force me.” [[Limbic system]] problems take the form of body symptoms: “I feel rotten all over” gradually centering in, under enough stress, on one acute disabling symptom. This last is [[Eric Berne]]’s “Wooden Leg” game, which asks to be relieved of social participation or interaction on the grounds of being physically hors de combat. 

[[Neurosomatic Circuit]] consciousness bleaches out all these problems at once. The disappearance of [[Limbic system]] "physical” illnesses only seems more “miraculous” than the transcendence of [[Emotional-Territorial Circuit]] emotionalism, [[Time-Binding Semantic Circuit|Semantic Circuit]] perplexity and [[Socio-Sexual Circuit]] guilt. It is the Cartesian mind/body dualism that makes us think of such [[Limbic system]] “physical” cures as somehow stranger or more spooky than any rapid improvement on the other circuits. One of the intents of our terminology is precisely to transcend that Cartesian dualism, making all the circuits equally comprehensible within one context.
