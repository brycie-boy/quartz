## Mechanical mode #🧠 

In mechanical mode, [[we generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs]]. We operate unconsciously and [[habit]]ually and are unable to [[jump out of the system]]. We can only operate strictly within the predetermined rules of a system, and we’re willing to wait an infinite length of time for an answer.

- [[Those with impairments in the right frontolimbic regions have trouble with stopping whatever they're currently doing]]
