## Mechanical mode #🧠

In mechanical mode, [we generally struggle to examine and criticize our own neural programs](We%20generally%20struggle%20to%20examine%20and%20criticize%20our%20own%20neural%20programs.md). We operate unconsciously and [habit](Habit.md)ually and are unable to [jump out of the system](Jump%20out%20of%20the%20system.md). We can only operate strictly within the predetermined rules of a system, and we’re willing to wait an infinite length of time for an answer.
