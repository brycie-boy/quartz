## The right hemisphere attends to the personal, while the left focuses on the abstract and impersonal

Because [the right hemisphere sees things in their context](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20things%20in%20their%20context.md), it is interested in the personal, by contrast with the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), which has more affinity for the abstract or impersonal. The [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)'s view of the world in general is construed according to what is of concern to it, not according to objective impersonal categories, and therefore has a personal quality. This is both its strength and its weakness in relation to the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md). It deals preferentially with whatever is approaching it, drawing near, into relationship with it. The right [temporal lobe]() deals preferentially with memory of a personal or emotionally charged nature, what is called episodic memory, where the left [temporal lobe]() is more concerned with memory for facts that are in the public domain.
