## Serotonin can breakdown dopamine resulting in less reward-seeking behavior  #üß†

The [serotonergic pathway](Serotonergic%20pathway.md) has the capacity to tame (or excite) the [Mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md). Animal data has shown that the contentment from [serotonin](Serotonin.md) can reverse addictive behavior. [Serotonin](Serotonin.md) can speed up the breakdown and disposal of [dopamine](Dopamine.md), resulting in decreased [dopamine](Dopamine.md)-related reward signaling and reward-seeking behavior. In humans, we know that high levels of serotonin can decrease alcohol intake (although your antidepressants can‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre imbibing three bottles a day). Conversely, [serotonin](Serotonin.md) depletion (through experimental depletion of [tryptophan]()) is associated with risky choice making.1Serotonin agonists such as [LSD]() and [psilocybin]() are being used as potential treatments for smoking, alcohol, and other drug addictions.
