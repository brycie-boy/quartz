## Genes that predispose someone to depression are only expressed when they are repeatedly exposed to stressors

If you have ‚Äúthe [gene]()‚Äù (or [gene]()s) ‚Äúfor‚Äù [depression](Depression.md), then is [depression](Depression.md) inevitable? Obviously not, and the best evidence for this is to consider identical twins. One has [depression](Depression.md) and the other, sharing all the same [gene]()s, has about a 50 percent chance of having the disease as well, a much higher rate than in the general population. There, pretty solid evidence for [gene]()s being involved. But flip this the other way. Share every single [gene]() with someone who is [depressive](Depression.md) and you still have a 50 percent chance of not having the disease.

This is because [Gene expression is highly contingent on the environment](Gene%20expression%20is%20highly%20contingent%20on%20the%20environment.md). [Those undergoing significant stress are more likely to develop depression](Those%20undergoing%20significant%20stress%20are%20more%20likely%20to%20develop%20depression.md), and [gene]()s increase the risk of [depression](Depression.md), but only in certain environments: you guessed it, only in *stressful* environments. This is shown in a number of ways, but most dramatically in a study by [Avshalom Caspi]() at King‚Äôs College, London. Scientists identified a certain [gene]() in humans that increases the risk of [depression](Depression.md). More specifically, it is a [gene]() that comes in a few different ‚Äúallelic versions‚Äù‚Äîa few different types or flavors that differ slightly in function; have one of those versions, and you‚Äôre at increased risk. 

So having version X of this [gene]() Z doesn‚Äôt guarantee you develop [depression](Depression.md), it just increases your risk. And, in fact, knowing nothing more about someone than which version of [gene]() Z someone has doesn‚Äôt increase your odds of predicting whether they gets [depressed](Depression.md). Version X increases [depression](Depression.md) risk only when coupled with a history of repeated major [stressor](Stressor.md)s. Amazingly, the same has been shown with studies of some nonhuman primate species, who carry a close equivalent of that [gene]() Z. It‚Äôs not the [gene]() that causes it. It‚Äôs that the [gene]() interacts with a certain environment. More specifically, a [gene]() that makes you vulnerable in a stressful environment. But [genetic theories of medical or mental conditions can enable people or society to absolve themselves from responsibility](Genetic%20theories%20of%20medical%20or%20mental%20conditions%20can%20enable%20people%20or%20society%20to%20absolve%20themselves%20from%20responsibility.md), thus if the enviroment really is stressful, such theories get those responsible off the hook.
