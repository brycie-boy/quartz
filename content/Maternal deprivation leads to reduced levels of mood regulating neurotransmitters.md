## Maternal deprivation leads to reduced levels of mood regulating neurotransmitters

Maternal nurturing determines the levels of [serotonin](Serotonin.md). Peer-reared monkeys separated from their mothers in laboratory experiments have lower lifelong levels of [serotonin](Serotonin.md) than do monkeys brought up by their mothers. In adolescence these same monkeys are more aggressive and are far more likely to consume [alcohol]() in excess.7 We see similar effects with other [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s that are essential in regulating mood and behavior, such as [norepinephrine](Norepinephrine.md). Even slight imbalances in the availability of these [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md)s are manifested in aberrant behaviors such as fearfulness and hyperactivity, characteristic of [adhd](ADHD.md), and increases the individual’s sensitivity to stressors for a lifetime. In turn, such acquired traits increase the risk of [addiction](Addiction.md).
