## Maternal deprivation leads to reduced levels of mood regulating neurotransmitters  # 

Maternal nurturing determines the levels of [[serotonin]]. Peer-reared monkeys separated from their mothers in laboratory experiments have lower lifelong levels of [[serotonin]] than do monkeys brought up by their mothers. In adolescence these same monkeys are more aggressive and are far more likely to consume [[alcohol]] in excess.7 We see similar effects with other [[neurotransmitter]]s that are essential in regulating mood and behavior, such as [[norepinephrine]]. Even slight imbalances in the availability of these [[neurotransmitter]]s are manifested in aberrant behaviors such as fearfulness and hyperactivity, characteristic of [[adhd]], and increases the individual’s sensitivity to stressors for a lifetime. In turn, such acquired traits increase the risk of [[addiction]].
