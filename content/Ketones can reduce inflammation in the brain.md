## Ketones can reduce inflammation in the brain

Not only can [ketones provide more energy to the brain than glucose](Ketones%20provide%20more%20energy%20to%20the%20brain%20than%20glucose.md), they can also reduce [brain](Brain.md) [inflammation](). Metabolizing [glucose]() requires oxygen, and thus can cause [oxidative stress](). Over time, that stress can contribute to chronic systemic [inflammation](), which can damage our [cell]()s‚Äô [mitochondria](). The inflamed [brain](Brain.md) with damaged [mitochondria]() is an unhealthy, impaired [brain](Brain.md). [Ketone](Ketone.md)s are a much ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù source of energy, meaning that when they are burned, they do not promote [inflammation](). [Ketone](Ketone.md)s are also signaling molecules, and one thing they are able to signal for is greater [antioxidant]() production‚Äîimportant for anti-aging in general, especially as it relates to the [brain](Brain.md).
