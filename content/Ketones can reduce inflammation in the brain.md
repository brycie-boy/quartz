## Ketones can reduce inflammation in the brain  # 

Not only can [[ketones provide more energy to the brain than glucose]], they can also reduce [[brain]] [[inflammation]]. Metabolizing [[glucose]] requires oxygen, and thus can cause [[oxidative stress]]. Over time, that stress can contribute to chronic systemic [[inflammation]], which can damage our [[cell]]s‚Äô [[mitochondria]]. The inflamed [[brain]] with damaged [[mitochondria]] is an unhealthy, impaired [[brain]]. [[Ketone]]s are a much ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù source of energy, meaning that when they are burned, they do not promote [[inflammation]]. [[Ketone]]s are also signaling molecules, and one thing they are able to signal for is greater [[antioxidant]] production‚Äîimportant for anti-aging in general, especially as it relates to the [[brain]].
