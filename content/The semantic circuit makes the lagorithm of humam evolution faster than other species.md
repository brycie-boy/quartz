## The semantic circuit makes the lagorithm of humam evolution faster than other species

[In evolution, entropy increases in non-living systems, and negentropy increases in living-systems](In%20evolution,%20entropy%20increases%20in%20non-living%20systems,%20and%20negentropy%20increases%20in%20living-systems.md), and the human [logarithmic](Logarithm.md) increment accelerates faster than pre-human evolution because through the third, [semantic circuit](Time-Binding%20Semantic%20Circuit.md) and its symbols (words, maps, equations etc.) we are able to pass information (negative entropy: coherence) from generation to generation.
