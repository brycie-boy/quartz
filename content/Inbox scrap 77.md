CHAPTER 6  
NEW AEON INITIATION

67

2) The True Self contains Good & Evil, Upright & Averse

67

Initiation in the New Aeon is “the Child Growing to Maturity” by  
the slaying of the ego-self whose “death is life to come” for the True Self.  
But what is the nature of that True Self? Essentially, the True Self  
transcends dualities. Specifically, the True Self transcends the moral  
duality of Good and Evil.

67

People have a common tendency to imagine their goal as their  
“Higher Self” which they imagine as Absolute Good, caring, benevolent,  
et cetera. In short, many people construct an ideal or an abstraction of  
their highest ideals and believe that to be the goal. Crowley asserts, “He is  
not, let me say with emphasis, a mere abstraction from yourself; and that is  
why I have insisted rather heavily that the term 'Higher Self' implies a  
damnable heresy and a dangerous delusion.”80 The term “Higher Self” is a  
delusion because the aim of Initiation in the New Aeon is to bring the  
individual to identify with the “Total Self” or “All-Self,” not the “Higher  
Self” (or “Lower Self”). We must explore and conquer both the “good”  
and “evil” sides of ourselves: in terms of modern psychology, we cannot  
neglect our own Shadow. As Crowley advises, “every magician must  
firmly extend his empire to the depth of hell.”81 As Nietzsche says, “The  
great epochs of our life are the occasions when we gain the courage to  
rebaptize our evil qualities as our best qualities.”82

82 Nietzsche, Friedrich. Beyond Good & Evil.

67

Much of Thelema’s imagery may be seen as “sinister.” Examples  
include the “Beast” and “Babalon” from the Book of Revelations (where  
they do not appear in a favorable light), the experience of divinity as “evil  
kisses corrupt[ing] the blood… as an acid eats into steel, as a cancer that

68

utterly corrupts the body”83 and “poison,”84 “the concealed” within oneself  
wherein “all things are in thine own Self”85 is called Hell or Satan,86 et  
cetera. These could all be considered as attempts to bring the psyche of  
the individual to acceptance of both the upright and averse aspects of  
existence. One might even say it is the “darker” side of the self emerging  
because of its neglect in Old Aeon systems which focus on Good, Virtue,  
Grace, et cetera, and exclude their opposites. In the New Aeon we assert   
that the True Self contains (and thereby transcends) both Good and Evil.  
“Less than All cannot satisfy Man.”87

68

This idea of the True Self as containing both Heaven and Hell,  
Good and Evil, Upright and Averse, is captured succinctly in our Holy  
Books:  
“I reveal unto you a great mystery. Ye stand between the abyss of  
height and the abyss of depth. In either awaits you a Companion;  
and that Companion is Yourself. Ye can have no other  
Companion. Many have arisen, being wise. They have said 'Seek  
out the glittering Image in the place ever golden, and unite  
yourselves with It.' Many have arisen, being foolish. They have  
said, 'Stoop down unto the darkly splendid world, and be wedded  
to that Blind Creature of the Slime.' I who am beyond Wisdom  
and Folly, arise and say unto you: achieve both weddings! Unite  
yourselves with both! Beware, beware, I say, lest ye seek after the  
one and lose the other! My adepts stand upright; their head above  
the heavens, their feet below the hells… Thus shall equilibrium  
become perfect.”   
88

68

88 Liber Tzaddi, lines 33-42.

68

As mentioned in the previous section of this essay, the True Self  
transcends the duality of Life and Death. In this section we see that the  
True Self transcends the duality of Upright and Averse, Good and Evil.  
The True Self is even “beyond Wisdom and Folly.” We must unite both

69

with the Upright, “the glittering Image in the place ever golden,” and with  
the Averse, “that Blind Creature of the Slime.” Only thereby may man  
come to knowledge of his true Self: otherwise the individual will have a  
lopsided perspective of the self. One must remember that it is only  
because of its roots deep into the dark ground that a tree is able to  
produce fruit. As the psychologist Abraham Maslow noted, “Man’s higher  
nature rests upon man’s lower nature, needing it as a foundation and  
collapsing without this foundation.”89

69

89 Maslow, Abraham. Toward a Psychology of Being.

69

The method of Initiation in the New Aeon is therefore one of   
Union of Opposites and Equilibrium. The equilibrium is not that of  
moderation, the Middle Path of Buddha (or the Doctrine of the Mean of  
Aristotle), where we seek to avoid extremes and remain in the center. The  
equilibrium of New Aeon Initiation is understood as the balance attained  
by pushing to both extremes of any duality. “Go thou unto the outermost  
places and subdue all things.”90 We don’t take the upright (“white light”)  
or averse (“satanic”) of the Upright/Averse duality and aim for that alone,  
we aim for both the heavens and the hells. One might say, symbolically,  
the Old Aeon is like a pole or a tree, where the vertical section is straight  
and narrow, avoiding extremes. The New Aeon is then like a large  
building or a pyramid where the base is expanded horizontally. This  
symbolically shows that, by pushing towards the extremes (expanding the  
base horizontally in this metaphor), we enlarge our foundations which  
thereby allow us to withstand the “winds” of experience better. As it says  
in The Book of the Law, “Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear  
more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! …But exceed! exceed! Strive  
ever to more!”91 William Blake also enigmatically stated, “The road of  
excess leads to the palace of wisdom.”92

69

We can look again to Horus (with the Infinitely Contracted Core of  
Flame as His Heart and the Infinitely Expansive Space as His Body) as a  
symbol of That which transcends the dualities of Good and Evil, Upright  
and Averse. In uniting with both the “glittering Image” and the “Blind  
Creature of the Slime,” we come to know ourselves as the All which  
contains but transcends both: “For two things are done and a third thing is

69

91 Liber AL, II:70-72.  
92 Blake, William. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.

70

begun… Horus leaps up thrice armed from the womb of his mother.”93  
Again, as Horus says in The Vision and the Voice, “I am light, and I am  
night, and I am that which is beyond them. I am speech, and I am silence,  
and I am that which is beyond them. I am life, and I am death, and I am  
that which is beyond them.”94 We might add, “I am good, and I am evil,  
and I am that which is beyond them.”

70

Horus, the Sun, is a symbol of That   
which contains & transcends dualities, an image of our True Selves,   
identical in essence yet diverse in expression for each individual; other  
cognate symbols include the point in the circle (the Solar glyph), the Rose-Cross, seminal and vaginal fluid combined (two live, generative fluids  
combined into a third which “is one substance and not two, not living and  
not dead, neither liquid nor solid, neither hot nor cold, neither male nor  
female”95), the Heart Girt with the Serpent,96 the cross in the circle, the  
circle squared,97 the Sun and the Moon conjoined,98 the Lion and the  
Eagle, the word ABRAHADABRA, and infinite others. In a certain ritual  
where the individual comes to identify with Horus, we proclaim our  
transcendence of the moral duality: “There is no grace: there is no guilt: /  
This is the Law: DO WHAT THOU WILT!”99  
“For Perfection abideth not in the Pinnacles, or in the Foundations,  
but in the ordered Harmony of one with all.”

3) Embrace of the World

70

“Enjoy all things of sense and rapture…”

70

101

70

101 Liber AL, II:22.

70

We found the True Self with which we come to identify in  
Initiation is beyond the duality of Life and Death (part 1) as well as the

71

duality of Good and Evil (part 2). Now we unite yet another divide with  
an embrace of the physical, “mundane” world. Another common  
dichotomy (at least in the West) that has split the psyche of man is Spirit  
versus Matter, or Sacred versus Profane.

71

In the ancient and medieval world, the predominant conception of  
the universe was of an earth below and the heavens above. People  
conceived the law of the Heavens as perfect and the Earth as degraded.  
Isaac Newton was one of the main figures who helped bridge the gap  
between Heaven and Earth. He said that the same force which makes  
objects fall on earth is the same force which makes the celestial objects in  
heaven move in their orbits: gravity. Symbolically and literally, Newton  
said the heavens and earth do not have separate laws but abide by one  
law. Also, we now know that the heavens are not above us but surround  
us on all sides. There is no separation between the “mundane” Earth and  
the “spiritual” Heavens: Earth is literally immersed in the Heavens.

71

In the New Aeon we assert that “Every man and every woman is a  
star.”102 On the physical level, we are all literally made of star-stuff (or  
“stardust”), as Carl Sagan was fond of noting, but there is a more  
important meaning here. Nuit – who says of herself, “I am Heaven”103 – is  
a symbol of the Infinite Space in which we are all immersed. Each star –   
each individual – is the center of self-awareness & expression of Heaven   
on Earth. Crowley writes, “Know firmly, o my son, that the true Will  
cannot err; for this is thine appointed course in Heaven, in whose order is  
Perfection.”104 In an important sense, this asserts that we too are in a  
perfect course through Heaven just as the celestial stars are. In the New  
Aeon there is an “unveiling of the company of heaven”105: every man and  
every woman. We are each Gods, Stars going our unique Ways in  
Heaven. Crowley comments, “[The] Pantheism of AL: The Book of the  
Law shows forth all things as God”106 and “The 'company of heaven' is  
Mankind, and its 'unveiling' is the assertion of the independent godhead of  
every man and every woman!”107

105 Liber AL, I:2.  
106 Djeridensis Working, I:2.  
107 New Comment to Liber AL, I:2.

72

From all these considerations it is easy to see that in the New  
Aeon, not only does the True Self transcend the duality of Heaven and  
Earth/Spiritual and Mundane, but there is essentially no distinction  
between them at all. The Earth is not a prison, but a Temple where the   
sacrament of Life may be enacted; the body is not corrupt, but a pulsing   
and thriving vessel for the expression of Energy; sex is not sinful, but a   
mysterious conduit of pleasure and power as well as an lmage of the   
ecstatic nature of all Experience.

72

In fact, the embrace of the world, and even an ecstatic embrace of  
the world, naturally comes from cosmological perspective of the New  
Aeon. “Existence is pure joy”108 in the New Aeon (and not pure sorrow as  
some hypochondriacs and many pessimists since have suggested). We are  
also told, “the Truth of the universe is delight.”109 This is because the   
Cosmological Picture of the New Aeon is that all Experiences are acts of   
Love between Infinite Forms (“Nuit”) and Infinite Forces (“Hadit”).  
“Hadit, who is the complement of Nuit ['the infinite in whom all  
we live and move and have our being']… is eternal energy, the  
Infinite Motion of Things, the central core of all being. The  
manifested Universe comes from the marriage of Nuit and Hadit;  
without this could no thing be. This eternal, this perpetual  
marriage-feast is then the nature of things themselves; and  
therefore everything that is, is a crystallization of divine ecstasy.”   
110

72

Therefore, in the New Aeon we see every experience as the joyful  
union between Form and Force, Infinite Space and Infinite Motion. The  
world itself is an expression of Divinity, and therefore there is no reason to  
retreat from it in New Aeon Initiation. Just as we must transcend the  
dualities of Life & Death and Good & Evil, we must transcend the duality  
of Heaven & Earth, Sacred & Profane. We are told, “Worship all things;  
for all things are alike necessary to the Being of the All.”111 This idea of  
worshiping all things and not making a distinction between “spiritual” and  
“mundane” leads to the Formula of the Scarlet Woman.

72

109 The Vision & the Voice, 17th Aethyr.  
110 Liber DCCCXXXVII: The Law of Liberty.  
111 The Vision & the Voice, 19th Aethyr.

73

“The Formula of the Scarlet Woman” refers to a certain attitude to  
the world. The Scarlet Woman is traditionally associated with the image of  
a whore, who symbolically represents “that which allows anything and  
everything into itself.” The opposite image is that of a chaste woman who  
shuts herself up and does not allow any intimate contact with anything  
around herself. Crowley writes, “The Enemy is this Shutting up of things.  
Shutting the Door is preventing the Operation of Change, i.e. of Love… It  
is this 'shutting up' that is hideous, the image of death. It is the opposite of  
Going, which is God.”112 The whore is an image of Change and the  
embrace of all things without distinction, and the chaste woman is an  
image of Stagnation and the separation from all things.

73

The chaste woman  
is also therefore an image of the ego which refuses to give up its claim to  
be “King of the Mountain” (the True Self is the rightful “King” and the  
ego its minister, but the ego insists on claiming this title). Just like a chaste  
woman will not “let herself go” to have intimate relations with others, the  
ego will not “let itself go” to dissolve in the non-ego, the rest of the world,  
so that the individual may become One (beyond dualities).

73

As mentioned  
in the first section of this essay, the work of each person is the release of  
identification with the ego and the consequent identification with Horus,  
That which transcends Life and Death (and all dualities). We are therefore  
a “chaste woman” if we refuse to release identification with the ego and  
insist on a world of division (i.e. ego vs. world/non-ego). This is another  
example of the “averse” or “sinister” symbolism that is often used in the  
New Aeon: the symbol of stagnation is a chaste woman (chastity being a  
“virtue” in the Old Aeons) and the symbol of growth & change is a whore  
(promiscuity/sensuality being a “vice”/“sinful” in the Old Aeons).

73

In summary: the Formula of the Scarlet Woman applies to every   
individual (not just females) and refers to the attitude of accepting all   
things into oneself, refusing nothing, and growing through their   
assimilation. Crowley writes, “[this is] a counsel to accept all impressions; it  
is the formula of the Scarlet woman; but no impression must be allowed to  
dominate you, only to fructify you; just as the artist, seeing an object, does  
not worship it, but breeds a masterpiece from it.”113 Therefore, we accept  
all things but we do not thereby become a passive, lifeless receptacle  
which is buffeted by external forces; instead we must allow all things “to

73

112 New Comment to Liber AL, III:55.  
113 The Book of Lies, chapter 4.

74

fructify” us. We all accept all things but we also turn these things towards  
the accomplishment of our Wills. Here is an illustration of this point: a  
musical composer does not neglect C# as “profane” or “not worthy” but  
accepts all notes as worthy and beautiful in themselves, but that does not  
mean his song will consist of hitting all the keys at once. On the contrary,  
he selects among the possible notes, arranges them in accordance with his  
vision, and produces a particular composition. The same idea is true for  
the Scarlet Woman, for the Formula of the Scarlet Woman is the  
acceptance of all things no matter if they are “unclean” or “mundane.”  
Crowley insists, “I urge you to beware of the pride of the spirit, of the  
thought of anything as evil or unclean. Make all things serve you in your  
Magick [causing Change in conformity with Will] as weapons.”114

74

In short, in the New Aeon we do not avoid the things of the world  
or the world itself in fear of it being “un-spiritual,” “profane,” or  
“mundane.” On the contrary, each individual is immersed in Heaven  
itself, as a Star among Stars. In the New Aeon, each individual proclaims,  
“All things are sacred to me”115 and enacts “the Formula of the Scarlet  
Woman,” refusing nothing and accepting all. Thereby does each  
individual come to embody the union between (and the fruit of) Heaven  
and Earth.  
“Behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends  
who be hermits. Now think not to find them in the forest or on the  
mountain; but in beds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of  
women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eyes, and  
masses of flaming hair about them; there shall ye find them. Ye  
shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy; and there  
shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this.”

4) Self as Redeemer

74

“There is no god but man.”

74

117 Liber OZ.

75

One common attribute of the Old Aeon systems is their insistence  
on the baseness, sinfulness, and helplessness of humanity. In this view,  
mankind is naturally in a state spiritual blindness, deafness, and dumbness;  
we don’t know what is best for ourselves, and we’re aimless when left to  
our own devices. This often translates into the necessity of giving oneself  
up to a higher power outside of oneself: to the priest class, to the guru, to  
God, to the State, and (most recently) to advertisers.

75

In the New Aeon, we   
place no faith on the grace of any god or guru; we assert no need to   
become an Initiate beyond oneself.

75

As was mentioned in a previous section of this essay, each person  
must unite with both the “lower” (“the abyss of depth,” “that Blind  
Creature of the Slime”) and “higher” (“the abyss of height,” “the glittering  
Image”) Companion – those “Upright” and “Averse” aspects of themselves  
beyond the current awareness of the ego, which must be released,  
explored, and assimilated. A very important facet of this “great mystery” is  
that, “that Companion is Yourself. Ye can have no other Companion.” 118  
Although we seek to unite with those abysses beyond our selves (insofar as  
“self” is here considered as the ego-self), those abysses are parts of  
Yourself. In terms of psychology, they are the unconscious aspects of the  
human psyche, which isn’t just “below” the ego (i.e. just “lower,”  
“animalistic” drives, the qliphothic in Qabalistic terms; “that Blind  
Creature of the Slime”) but is also “above” (insofar as it contains the  
“higher,” “divine,” the Neschamah in Qabalistic terms; “the glittering  
Image”).

75

We realize then that Initiation does not consist in “coming to God”   
or receiving “the grace of God” insofar as we consider a God separate or   
“above” ourselves, but rather, in the New Aeon, each person coming to a   
fuller, truer understanding of the Self is what constitutes Initiation. This is  
because “Initiation means the Journey Inwards,”119 and the Godhead we  
seek is not something other than our True Selves. As Crowley writes,  
“Behold! the Kingdom of God is within you, even as the Sun standeth  
eternal in the heavens, equal at midnight and at noon. He riseth not: he  
setteth not: it is but the shadow of the earth which concealeth him, or the  
clouds upon her face.”120 Again, we assert that this Self is always present,  
118 Liber Tzaddi, lines 34-35.  
119 Little Essays Toward Truth, “Mastery”.  
120 De Lege Libellum.  
67even at the beginning of the Great Work of coming to know it, although  
we normally function in and revert to the state of identifying with our  
minds and bodies (i.e. our normal ego-conception of the self).

76

This Work of coming to reveal and identify with the True Self does  
not require the blessing of priests, the empowerments of gurus, the  
presence of a “Master,” the grace of God, or the funding of the State. Each  
person must “Lift up thyself!”121 In one sense, it is only by the individual’s  
own courage, persistence, and hard work that the Great Work can ever be  
accomplished. In another sense, Truth – the realization of one’s True Self  
beyond dualities – cannot be communicated.

76

It is as futile to try to communicate the experience of Unity with  
All Things as it is describing red to a blind person. We can use metaphors  
or analogies but they will never actually understand until they have  
experienced it themselves. As Crowley says, “all real secrets are  
incommunicable,”122 and this is because “truth is supra-rational” and so it  
is therefore “incommunicable in the language of reason.”123 Therefore, if  
there is any “faith,” it is the confidence conferred by the “consciousness of  
the continuity of existence.”124 This perception of Truth can only be   
partially communicated in poetics, metaphors, symbols, and analogies: it is   
the direct, individual experience of the True Self which brings real   
understanding of the Truth as That which is beyond dualities.

76

One can imagine the perception of Truth as a flower unfolding in  
the heart of every man and every woman: it is something inherent in the  
individual which is revealed. Humanity is not sinful, degenerate, empty, or  
untrustworthy but, rather, each individual is a Star, each a fountain of  
Godhead, and each inherently Divine.

76

It is the work of the individual to realize this Divinity in themselves,  
coming to know themselves not as the ego but as the True Self which  
transcends all opposites: “ye [shall] look upon yourselves, and behold All  
Things that are in Truth One Thing only.”125 This “consciousness of the  
continuity of existence” is no supernatural, extraterrestrial, supra-mundane, posthumous fantasy: each person can attain to this awareness

5) No Perfecting of the Soul

77

“The soul is, in its own nature, perfect purity, perfect calm, perfect  
silence… This soul can never be injured, never marred, never  
defiled.”   
127

77

This idea is related strongly to the ideas in the last section of the  
Self as Redeemer. We assert there is no reliance on God, guru, priest, or  
any external authority, but it is a misnomer to say we “redeem” ourselves  
for there is nothing to redeem. Crowley writes, “Redemption is a bad  
word; it implies a debt. For every star possesses boundless wealth; the only  
proper way to deal with the ignorant is to bring them to the knowledge of  
their starry heritage.”128 The “soul” does not need to be redeemed for it is  
perfect and pure in itself, it only is because of ignorance of our own  
Divine Birthright that we think ourselves imperfect and transient. This  
“soul” isn’t the personality of the individual – the ego-self which identifies  
with the mind and body – but rather the Self which is coterminous with  
All Things.

77

The True Self never dies as it is beyond all limitation, containing   
all things and relations within Itself. The body along with the mind surely   
will expire but it is only through the mysterious mechanisms of this mind   
and body that the Self, beyond all limits and opposites, may become self-aware and consciously experience the rapture of existence. This Self does  
not need to be redeemed or perfected: there is no Fall of Man to be  
rectified (Abrahamic religions) nor a Wheel of Suffering to be liberated  
from (Dharmic religions).

77

There is even no sense of the soul incarnating to attain to higher  
and higher “spiritual states” or towards “enlightenment.” In the New  
Aeon, the “starting point” is not a fallen, suffering, and sinful state, but

77

128 The Book of Thoth.

78

rather we are all Royal and Divine, Divinity-made-manifest, and “existence  
is pure joy”129 if it is seen with eyes that “Bind nothing!”130 i.e. eyes that see  
the unity underlying apparent dualities. As it is said, “Since all things are  
God, in all things thou seest just so much of God as thy capacity affordeth  
thee.”131 The essential symbol-metaphor is that the Star of Unity is always   
shining, potentially conscious, but we identify with the ego-self and are   
therefore mired in duality and limitation (once you identify with the ego,  
you are immediately not the non-ego or the world and therefore the world  
becomes Two instead of One). Crowley writes:

78

“We are not to regard ourselves as base beings, without whose  
sphere is Light or 'God'. Our minds and bodies are veils of the  
Light within. The uninitiate is a 'Dark Star,' and the Great Work  
for him is to make his veils transparent by 'purifying' them. This  
'purification' is really 'simplification'; it is not that the veil is dirty,  
but that the complexity of its folds makes it opaque. The Great  
Work therefore consists principally in the solution of complexes.  
Everything in itself is perfect, but when things are muddled, they  
become 'evil'.”   
132

78

The important point is that “everything in itself is perfect” but our  
minds inevitably “muddle” the situation which ends with us identifying  
with the ego instead of the True Self. Because all things are perfect in   
themselves, we obviously do not need any kind of God or guru to bestow   
redemption, liberation, or initiation upon us: the aspirant need only clear   
away the cloud-veils of ignorance around her Star, and the True Self will   
leap up within her awareness and burn away all division and limitation.   
As Crowley explains:

78

“This 'star' or 'Inmost Light' is the original, individual, eternal  
essence….we are warned against the idea of a Pleroma, a flame of  
which we are Sparks, and to which we return when we 'attain'.  
That would indeed be to make the whole curse of separate

existence ridiculous, a senseless and inexcusable folly... The idea  
of incarnations 'perfecting' a thing originally perfect by definition is  
imbecile. The only sane solution is... to suppose that the Perfect  
enjoys experience of (apparent) Imperfection.”   
133

79

In the New Aeon we go even further than one might expect: the  
“ignorance” of duality is not inherently evil or bad at all either. In short,  
duality is “ignorance” for one who still identifies with the ego, but once  
one has dissolved the ego and identified with the True Self one recognizes  
duality as the necessary means for self-awareness. For the individual mired  
in duality and identification with the ego, “coition-dissolution” is her  
formula, but one who has dissolved the ego and identified with the True  
Self has the formula of “creation-parturition”… and “The All, thus  
interwoven of These, is Bliss.”134 The body and the mind, with its   
inherently dualistic conceptions, are a prison of ignorance for the   
uninitiate and a temple for performing the Sacrament of Life for the   
initiate.

79

It takes the experience of the dissolution of the ego to overcome  
the morbid fear of death and accept duality, not as the condition of our  
suffering, but as the opportunity for us to rejoice in the uniting of diverse  
elements (self and world in each experience, along with the Supreme  
Union of ego and non-ego/subject and object). The world is both “None…  
and two”135… None, the continuous, is “divided for love’s sake, for the  
chance of union. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division  
is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.”136 In this conception, duality  
and the “creation of the world” as we know it (i.e. the normal dualistic  
world which we commonly inhabit) is actually the condition of “the  
chance of union.” Only if two things are separate can they unite and have  
the possibility of “the joy of dissolution” wherein the self becomes “all.”  
Crowley explains, “Nuit shews the object of creating the Illusion of  
Duality. She said: The world exists as two, for only so can there be known  
the Joy of Love, whereby are Two made One. Aught that is One is alone,  
and has little pain in making itself two, that it may know itself, and love

136 Liber AL, I:29-30.  
71itself, and rejoice therein.”137 Thereby does one embrace both unity and  
multiplicity (duality) in a higher Unity.

80

This perception of “the consciousness of the continuity of  
existence”138 is not something given by a god or a guru but a natural  
birthright of each individual. It is, as described in the first section of this  
essay, a natural step of Growth towards psychological-spiritual Maturity.  
And this also leads us to the final point: even this is a step along the Path.  
It may be the “End” in one sense (the end of the dominance of the ego,  
for once thing) but it is also the beginning, for “death is life to come.”139  
One still has to live one’s life. One might say, “Before initiation: work, live,  
and play; after initiation: work, live, and play,” for coming to identify with  
the True Self doesn’t mean the end of one’s mind and body along with  
their normal needs. In fact, the mind and body – the ego-self – are not  
destroyed permanently but rather they are reborn with renewed energy,  
the veils of ignorance (of duality as well as the falsity of the doctrines of  
the Fall of Man and the inherent Suffering of the world) having been torn  
away. One does not suddenly obtain the earthly power of a king or have  
the intellectual power of Einstein, but the change is something largely  
“internal,” for in initiation, “nothing is changed or can be changed; but all  
is trulier understood with every step.”140 It is this understanding of our  
True Selves, beyond the veils of mind and body, which we each strive to  
attain so that we may more effectively and joyfully manifest our wills in the  
world. The task is then simple yet difficult: each individual must dissolve  
the ego and their identification with it to identify with the True Self, always  
shining though we are unaware, which is beyond dualities and all  
limitation. In the end, “All you have to do is to be yourself, to do your  
will, and to rejoice.”141  
“No star can stray from its self-chosen course: for in the infinite  
soul of space all ways are endless, all-embracing: perfect.”

CHAPTER 5  
FUNDAMENTALS OF INITIATION  
IN THELEMA

47

The basics of initiation are explained fairly succinctly in a text  
called Liber LXI vel Causae or simply Liber Causae. It reads:  
“In all systems of religion is to be found a system of Initiation,  
which may be defined as the process by which a man comes to  
learn that unknown Crown.”  
This establishes that all systems of religion have some form or  
another of approaching the same Truth. They all contain some form of  
“the process by which a man comes to learn that unknown Crown,” which  
is here called “Initiation.” The “unknown Crown” is a Qabalistic reference  
to the first Sephirah on the Tree of Life, Kether, which literally means  
“Crown” and represents the Unity of Godhead to which man may attain.  
Some have called this “unknown Crown” the term “God,” some have  
called it “liberation,” or “unity,” or “Truth,” and countless other names.  
Ultimately, it is “unknown” and nameless because it is beyond the  
dualities of knower and known, beyond the dualities of the subject and  
object of language, and therefore cannot be accurately named. It is, to use  
the language of the Gnostic Mass, always “beyond speech and beyond  
sight.” Initiation is defined as the process whereby one may come to learn  
That.

47

Liber Causae continues:  
“Though none can communicate either the knowledge or the  
39power to achieve this, which we may call the Great Work, it is yet  
possible for initiates to guide others.”  
Here we are told what was mentioned above as a general principle  
of initiation: Initiation cannot be bestowed from others through words,  
symbols, rituals, or any other way. “None can communicate” does not  
mean there is not anyone smart or enlightened enough to communicate  
this Truth, but it is a Truth whose nature is simply incommunicable by  
virtue of it being beyond all names, forms, signs, and symbols.

48

Here we also see the process of “Initiation” being equated with the  
term “the Great Work,” as mentioned previously as well. We also learn  
that initiates may not communicate “that unknown Crown” but they can  
guide others toward it.

48

Liber Causae continues on this theme:  
“Every man must overcome his own obstacles, expose his own  
illusions. Yet others may assist him to do both, and they may  
enable him altogether to avoid many of the false paths, leading no  
whither, which tempt the weary feet of the uninitiated pilgrim.  
They can further insure that he is duly tried and tested, for there  
are many who think themselves to be Masters who have not even  
begun to tread the Way of Service that leads thereto.”

49

Related to this way of understanding “the Way of Service” is the  
fact that, especially within Thelema, there is an emphasis on “coming back  
to the world” once one has attained. This is virtually identical to the  
bodhisattva vow in Mahayana Buddhism whereby one swears to return  
from nirvana (liberation, attainment, et cetera) back to samsara (the  
mundane world of ignorance) in order that all beings may be liberated.  
There are plentiful examples within the Western tradition of this same  
idea, often involving the symbolism of someone who has attained  
returning from a distant and/or isolated place; prominent examples  
include returning from a mountain (e.g. Moses, Muhammad, and  
Nietzsche’s Zarathustra) as well as returning from the wilderness (e.g.  
Jesus). That is, becoming a Master is tied up in the Way of Service for one  
does not become a Master solely for enlightening oneself but also to help  
others attain to the Light.

50

The Mysteries in the New Aeon

50

It is understood that there is a single Light, “the Absolute Truth,”  
“the Unutterable,” et cetera, and the diversity of expression are simply  
different ways to symbolize and veil that Unity. In Thelema, there is a  
further understanding that there are different “formulas” of initiation or  
attainment that are efficacious in one time but that need to be updated for  
a new era or “aeon.” A virtually identical notion is held in the Hindu  
doctrine of the “yugas” or epochs (e.g. the Kali Yuga) where the  
39 Liber LXV, I:2.  
40 Liber Porta Lucis sub figura X, line 19.  
42requirements to attain liberation change with each “yuga.” This is the  
essential meaning behind the idea that we are in a “New Aeon.” Let’s look  
into this idea in more depth:

51

In the world of Western esotericism or “occultism,” there is a  
certain symbolic way that the “Mysteries” of the path of initiation are  
explained. In general, there are a series of ceremonial rituals which each  
candidate undergoes, symbolizing the stages of illumination and offering  
guidance on the Path. Most importantly, there is a “Hierophant” (literally  
meaning “one who reveals sacred things”) whose purpose is to serve as the  
dispenser of the Mysteries. Ultimately, this Hierophant represents or  
reflects the God within each individual who is the true Hierophant of  
every initiate.

51

Now Horus sat in the East as the Hierophant  
and a new formula of attainment was put in place: “the word of the Law is  
Thelema.”41 This is the symbolism at work in The Book of the Law when  
it is written, “Abrogate are all rituals, all ordeals, all words and signs. Ra-Hoor-Khuit hath taken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods…  
41 Liber AL, I:39.  
43Hoor in his secret name and splendour is the Lord initiating.”42 In  
Thelema, this Equinox of the Gods is said to have occurred on the Vernal  
Equinox of 1904, with the new Book of the Law – a new Law for a new  
aeon – being received a few days afterward.

52

Crowley comments on this  
verse of The Book of the Law:   
“This verse [AL I:49] declares that the old formula of Magick — the  
Osiris-Adonis-Jesus-Marsyas-Dionysus-Attis-et cetera formula of the  
Dying God – is no longer efficacious. It rested on the ignorant  
belief that the Sun died every day, and every year, and that its  
resurrection was a miracle. The Formula of the New Aeon  
recognizes Horus, the Child crowned and conquering, as God. We  
are all members of the Body of God, the Sun; and about our  
System is the Ocean of Space. This formula is then to be based  
upon these facts. Our 'Evil', 'Error', 'Darkness', 'Illusion', whatever  
one chooses to call it, is simply a phenomenon of accidental and  
temporary separateness. If you are 'walking in darkness', do not try  
to make the sun rise by self-sacrifice [i.e. the formula of Osiris], but  
wait in confidence for the dawn, and enjoy the pleasures of the  
night meanwhile. The general allusion is to the Equinox Ritual of  
the G[olden] D[awn].”   
43

57

1) Death/Attainment as Non-cataclysmic

57

The basic idea associated with the last, Old Aeon is an obsession  
with death. The symbolic proponents of the Old Aeon paradigms – Osiris,  
Dionysus, Jesus, Adonis, et cetera – are all bound by the central motif of a  
(painful) death. Death is seen as catastrophic and a ritual act must be  
performed for the dead to be resurrected (or avenged). The cosmological  
parallel with this initiatory viewpoint is the idea that the Sun dies each  
night and the priesthood must perform a ritual for the Sun to rise again in  
the morning. Crowley often writes of the switch from the Old Aeon to the  
New Aeon view as paralleling the switch from a geocentric to a  
heliocentric view of our Solar System. Now we know that the Sun does not  
“die” each night, nor does any priest need to perform any kind of ritual  
for the Sun to rise in the morning. We know the Sun is constantly shining  
and it is only the turning of the earth which creates the succession of day  
and night: the apparent sight of the Sun “dying” and being “reborn” each  
night has changed to the understanding that the Sun is never born nor  
dies. Frater Achad, or Charles Stansfeld Jones, encapsulated this idea in  
his essay “Stepping Out of the Old Aeon Into the New”:  
“You know how deeply we have always been impressed with the  
ideas of Sun-rise and Sun-set, and how our ancient brethren, seeing  
the Sun disappear at night and rise again in the morning, based all  
their religious ideas in this one conception of a Dying and Re-arisen God. This is the central idea of the religion of the Old Aeon  
but we have left it behind us because although it seemed to be  
based on Nature (and Nature’s symbols are always true), yet we  
have outgrown this idea which is only apparently true in Nature.  
51 Liber AL, II:9.  
49Since this great Ritual of Sacrifice and Death was conceived and  
perpetuated, we, through the observation of our men of science,  
have come to know that it is not the Sun which rises and sets, but  
the earth on which we live which revolves so that its shadow cuts  
us off from the sunlight during what we call night. The Sun does  
not die, as the ancients thought; It is always shining, always  
radiating Light and Life.”

58

Crowley reiterates this view and explains the spiritual significance  
when he writes:  
“…When the time was ripe, appeared the Brethren of the Formula  
of Osiris, whose word is I A O; so that men worshipped Man,  
thinking him subject to Death, and his victory dependent upon  
Resurrection. Even so conceived they of the Sun as slain and  
reborn with every day, and every year. Now, this great Formula  
being fulfilled, and turned into abomination, this Lion came forth  
to proclaim the Aeon of Horus, the crowned and conquering  
child, who dieth not, nor is reborn, but goeth radiant ever upon  
His Way. Even so goeth the Sun: for as it is now known that night  
is but the shadow of the Earth, so Death is but the shadow of the  
Body, that veileth his Light from its bearer.”

58

Assimilating this idea of the Sun, in reality, never setting goes a  
long way to help the aspirant understand the spiritual truth of Thelema  
that this mirrors. In short, death (both of the ego and of the body) is no   
longer seen as cataclysmic in the New Aeon. This is because of two  
connected ideas: Death is complementary with Life, and Death is actually  
Change (“life to come”).

58

Let’s start with the first idea that Death is complementary with Life.  
“Death is the apex of one curve of the snake Life: behold all opposites as  
necessary complements, and rejoice.”53 Life and death are the two  
complements that constitute existence, and all things are formed from the  
interplay of Life and Death. All things in the universe, including the mind  
and body of the aspirant, are subject to Life and Death. One might

58

53 The Heart of the Master.

59

visualize existence as an undulating serpent, where the crest of a wave is  
Life and the trough is Death.

59

This leads into the idea of Death as Change. We often think of Life  
as constituting change and Death as constituting stagnation: death implies  
a stop or an end. The New Aeon views Death not as an end but as the  
possibility for new Life. Just as the Winter brings “death” to plant life, it  
also gives nutrients to the soil to allow for the inevitable new Spring. (As a  
note, “Death” refers to the death of the physical body, but more  
importantly to the “death” or “dissolution” of the ego which can and does  
occur during an individual’s life). Crowley explains this idea that Death is  
Change very succinctly:  
“Verily, love is death, and death is life to come. Man returneth not  
again; the stream floweth not uphill; the old life is no more; there is  
a new life that is not his. Yet that life is of his very essence; it is  
more He than all that he calls He.”   
54

59

The succinct idea that “death is life to come” is expounded here  
along with the idea that in the life that arises from death, we become  
“more ourselves.” The Life which arises from Death “is more He than all  
that he calls He.” This is because “all that he calls He” is his ego and in  
the death of the ego, we come to identify with the True Self which  
contains both Life and Death (and is therefore Eternal and Infinite). This  
death is not cataclysmic, but even equated with “love.” In the Tarot, which  
symbolically mirrors the initiatory paradigm of its age, traditionally has  
“Atu XIII” (or the 13th Trump) as “Death.” In the New Aeon, we may  
understand this card not as “Death” but “Transformation” or “Change.” In  
The Heart of the Master, Crowley writes short, poetic stanzas to describe  
each Tarot card. For “Atu XIII: Death” he writes, “The Universe is  
Change; every Change is the effect of an Act of Love; all Acts of Love  
contain Pure Joy. Die daily. Death is the apex of one curve of the snake  
Life: behold all opposites as necessary complements, and rejoice.” This is  
the fundamental paradigm-shift of the New Aeon: not only is Death  
actually Change (and “life to come”), but it is a form of Love, and “all  
Acts of Love contain Pure Joy.” There is no trace of cataclysm, sorrow, or  
suffering in this conception of Death in the New Aeon.

59

54 The Book of Lies, chapter 18.

60

Symbolically, this means Initiation (the myth-drama of each   
individual’s Path) is no longer portrayed as “The Man performing Self-Sacrifice” but as “The Child Growing to Maturity.” On this Crowley  
writes, “What then is the formula of the initiation of Horus? It will no  
longer be that of the Man, through Death. It will be the natural growth of  
the Child. His experiences will no more be regarded as catastrophic. Their  
hieroglyph is the Fool: the innocent and impotent Harpocrates Babe  
becomes the Horus Adult by obtaining the Wand.”55 The idea is one of  
coming to maturity, specifically of “obtaining the Wand” which represents  
the creative, generative power: this experience constitutes “spiritual  
puberty” for the individual, one might say. The process is not a cataclysm  
that needs rectifying (although puberty often seems cataclysmic!) but a  
natural process of growth and fulfillment of human potential.

60

Each person must destroy their ego self and come to identify with  
the True Self. Every man and woman must “break down the fortress of  
thine Individual Self, that thy Truth may spring free from the ruins.” 56 This  
necessarily involves the death or dissolution of the ego (“thine Individual  
Self”) to which many people are strongly attached. This is why death is  
seen as catastrophic: people view losses as catastrophic and the greatest  
loss to people is the loss of their personal ego-identity. In both the Old and  
New Aeons, the ego must experience death in process of Initiation. The  
difference is the view of this phenomenon: the Old Aeon views death as a   
cataclysmic event whereas the New Aeon views it as a necessary step in   
the progress of Growth. As Crowley explains, “The Ego fears to lose  
control of the course of the mind… The Ego is justly apprehensive, for this  
ecstasy will lead to a situation when its annhilation will be decreed…  
Remember that the Ego is not really the centre and crown of the  
individual; indeed the whole trouble arises from its false claim to be so.”57  
Before the individual personally experiences the dissolution of their own  
ego, they must assimilate this New Aeon idea that “there is that which  
remains” after this death. Each person then must come to directly  
experience and even embody this truth – that is, each individual must  
come to know this truth through their own experience. “Faith must be

57 Commentary to Liber LXV, I:60

61

slain by certainty,”58 as Crowley wrote. We might even say that each  
person is psychologically stuck in the Old Aeon paradigm until they have  
this experience of the death of the ego. Only then can they be “freed of  
the obsession of the doom of the Ego in Death.”59 Only then can the  
individual identify with “that which remains,” which transcends but  
contains both Life and Death. In the New Aeon, each person “Let[s] the  
Illusion of the World pass over thee, unheeded, as thou goest from  
Midnight to the Morning.”60 The New Aeon is the Aeon of the Crowned  
& Conquering Child: Horus, Heru-Ra-Ha, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and many other  
names. Horus is a symbol of the True Self which transcends Life and   
Death just as the Sun is a symbol of that which constantly shines even   
though day (Life) and night (Death) pass on earth, and just as the Child is   
a symbol of that which contains but transcends both mother (Life) and   
father (Death).

61

In the The Vision and the Voice, Horus himself says of his  
nature:  
“I am light, and I am night, and I am that which is beyond them. I  
am speech, and I am silence, and I am that which is beyond them.  
I am life, and I am death, and I am that which is beyond them. I  
am war, and I am peace, and I am that which is beyond them. I  
am weakness, and I am strength, and I am that which is beyond  
them. …And it shall be unto them a grace and a sacrament, and ye  
shall all sit down together at the supernal banquet, and ye shall  
feast upon the honey of the gods, and be drunk upon the dew of  
immortality — FOR I AM HORUS, THE CROWNED AND  
CONQUERING CHILD, WHOM THOU KNEWEST NOT!”   
61

61

As mentioned in later sections of this essay, in the New Aeon we  
view each individual as God Him/Herself. Therefore the work of each   
person is the release of identification with the ego and the consequent   
identification with Horus, That which transcends Life and Death (and all   
dualities). This is expressed symbolically by Frater Achad (and Crowley)  
by the idea of switching one’s perspective from Earth (the geocentric

59 Little Essays Toward Truth, “Mastery.”

62

viewpoint where we experience day/life and night/death; the perspective of  
the ego) to the perspective from the Sun (the heliocentric viewpoint where  
we experience perpetual shining through day and night; the perspective of  
the True Self)

62

This paradigmatic change from Old Aeon to New, in the sense of  
no longer seeing Death as cataclysmic, is captured symbolically in  
Crowley’s changes to old “formulae” to conform with the New Aeon  
point-of-view. Specifically, the change from IAO to VIAOV and the  
change from AUM to AUMGN62 exemplify the paradigm shift from Old  
Aeon to New Aeon.

62

On the formula of IAO, Crowley writes, “This formula is the  
principal and most characteristic formula of Osiris, of the Redemption of  
Mankind. 'I' is Isis, Nature, ruined by 'A', Apophis the Destroyer, and  
restored to life by ['O'] the Redeemer Osiris.”63 The basic idea is that I =  
Life which is ruined by A = Death/Chaos which must then be redeemed  
by O. Existence is therefore a process of endless cataclysms which require  
redemption from this point-of-view. How is this view changed from the  
point-of-view of New Aeon Initiation? Crowley continues, “THE MASTER  
THERION, in the Seventeenth year of the Aeon, has reconstructed the  
Word I A O to satisfy the new conditions of Magick imposed by  
progress.”

62

Now, no one would deny that all things change, that “all things  
must pass,” but from the point-of-view of physics, energy is never created  
nor destroyed. It is simply transformed into different forms. If we identify  
with any of these partial phenomena which inevitably must be  
transformed, we are subject to death. If we “die daily” to our ego-self, to  
our sense of division or separateness from the world, then we come to  
identify with the Whole Process. “The many change and pass; the one  
remains.”64 The All contains all opposites within itself, it is the symbol of  
the Serpent itself whose undulations are Life and Death, and therefore is  
eternal. This True Self, the All which knows no division, is Horus and  
“that which remains.

62

It is with these ideas in mind we can understand why, in the

62

62 Magick in Theory & Practice, chapters 5 and 7.  
63 Magick in Theory & Practice, chapter 5, which should be consulted for a more full  
examination of VIAOV.  
64 Liber Porta Lucis, line 20.

63

Aeon, IAO has become VIAOV. Basically, IAO has been surrounded by  
two “V”s.65 What does this mean?

63

Essentially, the “V” represents “that which remains.” There may be  
processes of creation, destruction, and reconstruction (IAO) but there is  
always “that which remains.” The “V” remains unchanged through the  
various “IAO processes” one might say. Even though the phallus of the  
father must “die” in ejaculation, it is a necessary step for new Life – the  
Child – to emerge… And the Semen, the Quintessence, remains  
unchanged (“that which remains”) throughout the entire process. This  
symbolic process exemplifies the ideas of the New Aeon, especially  
because the “death” in this case is ecstatic: the death is literally orgasmic.  
Further, Crowley writes, “the snake is the hieroglyphic representation of  
semen”66 and so the semen which is “that which remains” is identified with  
the snake or serpent which, as explained above, represents That which  
contains the complements of Life and Death (being the crest and trough of  
His undulations).

63

There is another interesting idea which this symbolic formula,

63

65 These refer to the Hebrew letter “Vav” or the Greek letter “Digamma” for various  
reasons which can be investigated in chapter 5 of Magick in Theory & Practice.  
66 The Book of Lies, commentary to chapter 8.

64

VIAOV, conceals: One might consider the original “V” as ignorant man,  
i.e. man as ignorant of his True Self/his identity with All Things, and the  
final “V” as man conscious of his own Divinity. It is through the process of  
IAO, or death of the ego, that each individual becomes consciously aware  
of him or herself as Horus, “that which remains,” for since all things are  
contained in the All-Self, it cannot be created or destroyed. Also, the “V”  
or the True Self was always there, except the individual was simply  
ignorant of this fact: “The series of transformations has not affected his  
identity; but it has explained him to himself.”67 Crowley explains, “…the  
'Stone' or 'Elixir' which results from our labours will be the pure and  
perfect Individual originally inherent in the substance chosen, and nothing  
else… the effective element of the Product is of the essence of its own  
nature, and inherent therein; the Work [then] consists in isolating it from  
its accretions.”68 As it is written in our Holy Book Liber LXV, “Thou wast  
with me from the beginning.”69

64

Moving onto AUM becoming AUMGN, Crowley writes:  
“The word AUM is the sacred Hindu mantra which was the  
supreme hieroglyph of Truth, a compendium of the Sacred  
Knowledge… Firstly, it represents the complete course of sound…  
Symbolically, this announces the course of Nature as proceeding  
from free and formless creation through controlled and formed  
preservation to the silence of destruction… We see accordingly  
how AUM is, on either system, the expression of a dogma which  
implies catastrophe in nature. It is cognate with the formula of the  
Slain God.”

64

The formula of AUM therefore suffers from the same attitude  
problem as the formula of IAO: nature is catastrophic. Moving beyond  
this idea of existence as catastrophic is, as explained above, one facet of  
New Aeon Initiation. Crowley explains:

“The cardinal revelation of the Great Aeon of Horus is that this  
formula AUM does not represent the facts of nature. The point of  
view is based upon misapprehension of the character of existence.  
It soon became obvious to The Master Therion that AUM was an  
inadequate and misleading hieroglyph. It stated only part of the  
truth, and it implied a fundamental falsehood. He consequently  
determined to modify the word in such a manner as to fit it to  
represent the Arcana unveiled by the Aeon of which He had  
attained to be the Logos. The essential task was to emphasize the  
fact that nature is not catastrophic, but proceeds by means of  
undulations.”   
71

65

The essential idea appears in the final sentence. As we have gone  
over above, the New Aeon point-of-view conceives existence as a Serpent  
whose undulations are Life and Death. The word AUM ends in “M”  
which symbolizes the fact that, “the formation of the individual from the  
absolute is closed by his death.”72 Again the idea is one of Death as a stop  
or an end instead of “life to come” or one instance of Change. Now, how  
would “GN” be added to the end of AUM “fix” the word? Crowley writes,  
“The undulatory formula of putrefaction is represented in the Qabalah by  
the letter N, which refers to Scorpio.”73 Both of these (the letter N and  
Scorpio) are traditionally attributed to “Atu XIII: Death” in the Tarot  
which was spoken of above (when it was suggested it might be more  
accurately titled “Change” or “Transformation”). Basically, “N” represents  
the idea that, “Death is life to come;” that is, Death is not an end but one  
apex of the curve of endless undulations. Crowley continues, “Now it so  
happens that the root GN signifies both knowledge [gnosis] and generation  
combined in a single idea, in an absolute form independent of  
personality.”74 The idea is basically that AUM does not accurately describe  
the course of nature because existence does not end in cataclysm.  
Therefore, by adding “GN” to AUM to form “AUMGN,” we assert that  
the process of nature is not cataclysmic. In fact, it does not end at all but

instead “proceeds by means of undulations”: Death is not the end but  
simply one trough of the endless winding of the Serpent of the All-Self.

66

Essentially, “all the sorrows are but as shadows; they pass & are  
done; but there is that which remains.”75 It is the work of each individual  
to dissolve and de-identify with the ego-self and identify with “that which  
remains,” the True Self which transcends all division (especially between  
Life and Death) in that it contains All. The death of the ego is not  
cataclysmic because we know the Sun of the True, All-Self which “is more  
He than all that he calls He,”76 is always shining regardless of our  
ignorance (our “darkness”). In short, in the New Aeon we give the advice,  
“If you are 'walking in darkness', do not try to make the sun rise by self-sacrifice, but wait in confidence for the dawn, and enjoy the pleasures of  
the night meanwhile.”77  
“With courage conquering fear shall ye approach me: ye shall lay  
down your heads upon mine altar, expecting the sweep of the  
sword. But the first kiss of love shall be radiant on your lips; and  
all my darkness and terror shall turn to light and joy. Only those

CHAPTER 8  
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THELEMA

95

METAPHYSICS

95

Ontology: None & Two

95

Ontology is the study of being, existence, or reality. Thelema’s  
ontology is stated simply as “None and Two.” The world is understood as  
“Nothing” or “Naught,” which is something completely beyond all

96

description and limit. In Liber AL I:27, it is written “Then the priest  
answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovely brows, and  
the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of  
sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men  
speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at  
all, since thou art continuous!”

96

Many mystics have called it “Unity” but even this, some may  
argue, implies something as “not-One.” Crowley writes, “All Things that  
are in Truth One Thing only, whose name hath been called No Thing.” 152  
From this comes the necessity of explaining the appearance of duality.  
Instead of a “Fall of Man” or an imprisonment of the soul in matter,  
Thelema explains the appearance of duality in this fashion: “None… and  
two. For I am divided for love’s sake, for the chance of union. This is the  
creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of  
dissolution all.”153 In this way, the many or divided are in such a position  
so they may become one and unite. This is given further explanation  
when Crowley writes, “The Many is as adorable to the One as the One is  
to the Many. This is the Love of These; creation-parturition is the Bliss of  
the One; coition-dissolution is the Bliss of the Many. / The All, thus  
interwoven of These, is Bliss.”154  
…see also the essay “Berashith” by Aleister Crowley; Magick Without  
Tears, chapter 5; and The Book of Lies chapters 3, 12, and 46.

96

Cosmology: Nuit, Hadit, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and Stars

96

Thelema understands Nuit as Infinite Space which is “Heaven” that

97

is occupied by various Points-of-View, or Hadit. Each star - “every man  
and every woman”156 – is in the Body of Infinite Space and has Hadit as its  
core, who is “the complement of Nu, my bride,”157 “the flame that burns in  
every heart of man, and in the core of every star,”158 as well as “Life, and  
the giver of Life.”159 These together create the Universe as we know it. ”In  
the sphere [Hadit is] everywhere the centre, as [Nuit], the circumference, is  
nowhere found.”160 There are many interpretations of Nuit and Hadit – for  
example, with Nuit as matter and Hadit as motion and their interplay  
being the universe but the basic idea remains the same.  
…see also Liber AL vel Legis, chapters 1 and 2; The Book of Lies,  
chapters 0 and 11; the Creed of Liber XV: The Gnostic Mass.

97

Eschatology: The destruction of the self & the dawning of the   
Aeon of Horus

97

Another interpretation of eschatology is the “destruction of the  
world by fire” (which can also be interpreted in the former sense of the  
destruction of the self), which Crowley gives symbolically in “Atu XX:  
Aeon” of the Tarot. In this other interpretation, the world was “destroyed  
by fire” with the reception of Liber AL vel Legis in 1904. Crowley writes  
in The Book of Thoth, “The old card was called The Angel: or, The Last  
Judgment. It represented an Angel or Messenger blowing a trumpet,  
attached to which was a flag, bearing the symbol of the Aeon of Osiris…  
The card therefore represented the destruction of the world by Fire. This  
was accomplished in the year of the vulgar era 1904, when the fiery god  
Horus took the place of the airy god Osiris in the East as Hierophant.”  
…see also The Book of Thoth, “XX. The Aeon”.

98

Teleology: Will

98

Teleology deals with the purpose or the understanding of the  
design of the universe. In Thelema, the teleology is clearly one of “Will.”  
One might contrast the teleology of Thelema with that of Schopenhauer’s  
Will-to-Life and Nietzsche’s Will-to-Power, where Thelema understands it  
as a Will-to-Love. All experiences and events are occurrences of two things  
uniting into a third. The necessary formula of each star is then “love under  
will” – to find that Will and do it.

98

Just as each star has its particular orbit in the macrocosm of space,  
every man and every woman has their particular Way on earth. As  
Crowley writes, “Each action or motion is an act of love, the uniting with  
one or another part of 'Nuit'; each such act must be 'under will,' chosen so  
as to fulfil and not to thwart the true nature of the being concerned.”161

98

EPISTEMOLOGY

98

There are two stances on reason that are expounded in Liber AL  
vel Legis. The first stance is that reason must be subservient to Will and  
the second stance is the importance of direct experience over reason.  
These ideas about reason intertwine and support one another.

98

First, the Will is “supra-rational” or beyond reason. The section in  
Liber AL that deals with this comes from chapter 2:  
“There is great danger in me; for who doth not understand these  
runes shall make a great miss. He shall fall down into the pit called  
Because, and there he shall perish with the dogs of Reason. Now a  
curse upon Because and his kin! May Because be accursed for  
ever! If Will stops and cries Why, invoking Because, then Will  
stops & does nought. If Power asks why, then is Power weakness.  
Also reason is a lie; for there is a factor infinite & unknown; & all  
their words are skew-wise. Enough of Because! Be he damned for a  
dog! But ye, o my people, rise up & awake!”   
162

98

161 Introduction to Liber AL.  
162 Liber AL, II:27-34.

99

Here we have a curse upon “Because,” “Reason,” and “Why.”  
There is no “Why” or “Because” to Will: it simply GOES, it simply IS.  
Because we inhabit a world of Infinite Space and since reason can only  
work with finite ideas and quantities, then reason cannot express the  
Infinite purely and accurately. It is a “lie” because of this “factor infinite &  
unknown.” Crowley writes, “There is no 'reason' why a Star should  
continue in its orbit. Let her rip! …It is ridiculous to ask a dog why it  
barks.

Note: nature does not need a reason to exist. It just is

99

One must fulfil one’s true Nature, one must do one’s Will. To  
question this is to destroy confidence, and so to create an inhibition.”163  
Therefore, reason should attend to its own business (solving problems of  
rationality) and allow the Will to flow uninhibited; otherwise, “One risks  
falling form the world of Will ('freed from the lust of result') to that of  
Reason.”164 Crowley continues:   
“We must not suppose for an instant that the Book of the Law is  
opposed to reason. On the contrary, its own claim to authority  
rests upon reason, and nothing else. It disdains the arts of the  
orator. It makes reason the autocrat of the mind. But that very fact  
emphasizes that the mind should attend to its own business. It  
should not transgress its limits. It should be a perfect machine, an  
apparatus for representing the universe accurately and impartially  
to its master. The Self, its Will, and its Apprehension, should be  
utterly beyond it.”   
165  
“When reason usurps the higher functions of the mind, when it  
presumes to dictate to the Will what its desires ought to be, it  
wrecks the entire structure of the star. The Self should set the Will  
in motion, that is, the Will should only take its orders from within  
and above.”

99

Another claim is made in Liber AL, “I give unimaginable joys on  
earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest,

100

ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice.”167 The Will does not require  
articles of faith to be accepted but rather asks that the individual rely on  
their experiences. It is the faith conferred by the direct experience of the  
“consciousness of the continuity of existence”168 that is offered.

100

Rational precepts are not proposed, debated over, accepted, and  
rejected but rather one attains various realizations or trances and learn  
from one’s experiences. When one attains the “consciousness of the  
continuity of existence”169 and becomes “chief of all,”170 the unity of this  
perception is not explainable by the duality of reason. In relation to this  
experience we find “there could be no reality in any intellectual concept  
of any kind, that the only reality must lie in direct experience of such a  
kind that it is beyond the scope of the critical apparatus of our minds. It  
cannot be subject to the laws of Reason; it cannot be found in the fetters  
of elementary mathematics; only transfinite and irrational conceptions in  
that subject can possibly shadow forth the truth in some such paradox as  
the identity of contradictories.”171

100

Crowley also says, “To have any sensible meaning at all, faith must  
mean experience… Nothing is any use to us unless it be a certainty  
unshakeable by criticism of any kind, and there is only one thing in the  
universe which complies with these conditions: the direct experience of  
spiritual truth. Here, and here only, do we find a position in which the  
great religious minds of all times and all climes coincide. It is necessarily  
above dogma, because dogma consists of a collection of intellectual  
statements, each of which, and also its contradictory, can easily be  
disputed and overthrown.”172 This perception of the world as continuous  
and unitary is not offered on faith but can be achieved and recognized as  
a certainty by those who attain thereto.

172 Eight Lectures on Yoga.

100

One other doctrine relating to reason that appears in Crowley’s  
writings but not explicitly in Liber AL is the idea of the circularity of  
reason. Reason can only manipulate and work with articles of reason; this

101

relates to what was said above because the problems in the sphere of  
reason should not usurp the power of or dictate actions to the sphere of  
Will. We have an example of this doctrine of the circularity of reason  
when Crowley writes, “All proofs turn out on examination to be  
definitions. All definitions are circular. (For a = bc, b = de … w = xy, and y  
= za.)”173 In this sense, reason deals with relations between illusion. This is  
certainly useful – science is a good example of this – but it doesn’t give us  
any powerful facts of the way things truly are.

101

In a deeper sense, reason works within the realms of duality while  
the Will must remain one-pointed and therefore not mired in the relations  
of reason. Crowley writes further, “All knowledge may be expressed in the  
form S=P. But if so, the idea P is really implicit in S; thus we have learnt  
nothing… S=P (unless identical, and therefore senseless) is an affirmation  
of duality; or, we may say, intellectual perception is a denial of Samadhic  
truth. It is therefore essentially false in the depths of its nature.”174 Reason  
is understood as simply the relation of words which point to other words,  
ad infinitum. Further, as mentioned above, because reason works with  
relations between ideas (the relation between “S” and “P” above), it  
affirms duality in the world. Two things can only be related in reason if  
they are distinct and therefore separate.

101

Again, all of these ideas about reason intertwine to give us a  
general picture of Thelema’s approach to the place of knowledge and  
reason. Essentially, the Will of the individual is beyond reason, or supra-rational, so one cannot ask “Why” of it or justify it with “Because.” The  
individual must then constantly go forward and experience new and  
various things, not depending on articles of faith. Reason is a human  
faculty that allows us to manipulate & find the relations between finite facts  
and ideas. Because of this it must work within its own sphere (i.e. deal with  
problems of rationality like mathematics, science, et cetera) while leaving  
the Will to act uninhibited. With this understanding, one can be guarded  
against reason when it asks “whence camest thou? Whither wilt thou go?”  
with the response “No whence! No whither! …Is there not joy ineffable in  
this aimless winging? Is there not weariness and impatience for who would

102

attain to some goal?”175

102

ETHICS

102

Since “There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt,”176 the only  
“right” action is that which fulfills that Will and the only “wrong” action is  
that which thwarts that Will: “The Word of Sin is Restriction.”177 Crowley  
explains, “[This] is a general statement or definition of Sin or Error.  
Anything soever that binds the will, hinders it, or diverts it, is Sin.” 178  
Essentially, any form of morality that works in absolutes, saying any  
quality is a priori “right” or “wrong” (or “evil”) is anathema to Thelema.  
“To us, then, 'evil' is a relative term; it is 'that which hinders one from  
fulfilling his true Will.'”179

102

The attitudes toward oneself and others are necessary outgrowths  
of “Do what thou wilt.” Since “Thou hast no right but to do thy will,” 180  
the value of self-discipline helps one do one’s Will with one-pointedness.  
As Crowley explains, “What is true for every School is equally true for  
every individual. Success in life, on the basis of the Law of Thelema,  
implies severe self-discipline.”181 Further, since ”Every man and every  
woman is a star”182 and each star has its own unique path, each “star” is  
must pursue their own Will and avoid interference in the affairs of others.  
In short, mind your own business. “It is necessary that we stop, once for  
all, this ignorant meddling with other people’s business. Each individual  
must be left free to follow his own path.”183 This consequently means there  
is total moral freedom, including sexual freedom. “Also, take your fill and

183 New Comment to Liber AL, I:31.

103

Aside from moving the locus of morality to the individual, making  
the Will the measure of what is “right” and “wrong,” Thelema does  
emphasize certain moral traits over others and views certain experiences  
as “good.”

103

One course of action that Thelema encourages is towards the  
attainment of Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel,  
Union with God, the dissolution of the ego or any other metaphor used in  
mysticism. Crowley explains, “A man must think of himself as a LOGOS,  
as going, not as a fixed idea. 'Do what thou wilt' is thus necessarily his  
formula. He only becomes Himself when he attains the loss of Egoity, of  
the sense of separateness. He becomes All, PAN, when he becomes Zero  
[see the 'Ontology' section of this essay].”186 Crowley puts it plainly when  
he writes, “There are many ethical injunctions of a revolutionary character  
in the Book, but they are all particular cases of the general precept to  
realize one’s own absolute God-head and to act with the nobility which  
springs from that knowledge.”187 These attainments are understood to be  
available to anyone and to help one understand the world, oneself, and  
one’s will more completely.

103

Another common moral theme in Thelema is strength over  
weakness.   
“Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force  
and fire, are of us.”   
188

103

184 Liber AL, I:51.  
185 Liber Aleph, chapter 38.  
186 “The Antecedents of Thelema” available in The Revival of Magick.  
187 Confessions, chapter 49.  
188 Liber AL, II:20.

104

“My disciples are proud and beautiful; they are strong and swift;  
they rule their way like mighty conquerors. The weak, the timid,  
the imperfect, the cowardly, the poor, the tearful — these are mine  
enemies, and I am come to destroy them.”   
189

104

Consequently, Thelema has a different view on “compassion”:   
“This also is compassion: an end to the sickness of earth. A  
rooting-out of the weeds: a watering of the flowers.”   
190  
“We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in  
their misery. For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings:  
stamp down the wretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong:  
this is our law and the joy of the world.”   
191

104

That is, “compassion” is not understood to be the support of the  
weak but rather the opposite: the “rooting-out of the weeds” or the  
destruction of the weak and the “watering of the flowers” or the promotion  
of the strong. This is compassion because it is “an end to the sickness of  
earth.”

104

A different view of pity is also held in light of Thelema’s view that  
“Every man and every woman is a star.”192 Crowley writes:  
“Pity implies two very grave errors — errors which are utterly  
incompatible with the views of the universe above briefly  
indicated. The first error therein is an implicit assumption that  
something is wrong with the Universe… The second error is still  
greater since it involves the complex of the Ego. To pity another  
person implies that you are superior to him, and you fail to  
recognize his absolute right to exist as he is. You assert yourself  
superior to him, a concept utterly opposed to the ethics of  
Thelema — 'Every man and every woman is a star' and each

105

being is a Sovereign Soul. A moment’s thought therefore will  
suffice to show how completely absurd any such attitude is, in  
reference to the underlying metaphysical facts.”   
193  
“The Book of the Law regards pity as despicable… to pity another  
man is to insult him. He also is a star, 'one, individual and eternal.'  
The Book does not condemn fighting — 'If he be a King, thou  
canst not hurt him.'”   
194

105

This leads to another view, which is that Thelema embraces  
conflict:  
“Despise also all cowards; professional soldiers who dare not fight,  
but play; all fools despise! But the keen and the proud, the royal  
and the lofty; ye are brothers! As brothers fight ye!”   
195

Note: fight for the sake of it?

105

“Lo, while in The Book of the Law is much of Love, there is no  
word of Sentimentality. Hate itself is almost like Love! 'As brothers  
fight ye!' All the manly races of the world understand this. The  
Love of Liber Legis is always bold, virile, even orgiastic. There is  
delicacy, but it is the delicacy of strength.”   
196

105

Thelema also enjoins the individual to rejoice because of life. A  
general theme of embracing and seeing the joy in all facets of life  
permeates Thelema:   
“Remember all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows  
are but as shadows; they pass & are done; but there is that which  
remains… They shall rejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth is not of  
us… But ye, o my people, rise up & awake! Let the rituals be  
rightly performed with joy & beauty! …a feast for life and a greater  
feast for death! A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my  
rapture! A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost

delight! Aye! feast! rejoice! there is no dread hereafter… Write, &  
find ecstasy in writing! Work, & be our bed in working! Thrill with  
the joy of life & death!”   
197  
“There is joy in the setting-out; there is joy in the journey; there is  
joy in the goal.”   
198

106

This view of the world arises out of the metaphysical ideas [see the  
'Cosmology' section of this essay] that Thelema entertains:   
“[Nuit] is the infinite in whom all we live and move and have our  
being. [Hadit] is eternal energy, the Infinite Motion of Things, the  
central core of all being. The manifested Universe comes from the  
marriage of Nuit and Hadit; without this could no thing be. This  
eternal, this perpetual marriage-feast is then the nature of things  
themselves; and therefore everything that is, is a crystallization of  
divine ecstasy.”   
199

106

In the end one must remember “There is no law beyond Do what  
thou wilt.”200 All of these ideas are subservient to the central law of “Do  
what thou wilt.” This is the beauty of the word Thelema, that it implies  
such a succinct and sublime answer to the problems of morality while also  
having complex and intricate implications.

CHAPTER 9  
THE WILL IN THELEMA

108

At the very beginning of The Book of the Law, there is one of the

109

most important statements in Thelema:  
“Every man and every woman is a star.”   
203

109

By this is meant that “we are all free, all independent, all shining  
gloriously, each one a radiant world”204 and further that “the Individual is  
the Autarch.”205 In the same sense that the sun, as a star, is center of the  
solar system in the physical macrocosm, every man and every woman is  
understood to be a sort of microcosmic star and center of his or her own  
system. “A star is an individual identity; it radiates energy, it goes, it is a  
point of view. Its object is to become the whole by establishing relations  
with other stars. Each such relation is an Event: it is an act of Love under  
Will”206 – Each individual is “an aggregate of such experiences, constantly  
changing with each fresh event, which affects him or her either consciously  
or subconsciously.”207

Certainly, from a psychological standpoint, it can be easily  
understood that we are all centers of our own universe208 and also  
“aggregates of experience” as our own memories show. Further, stars are  
self-luminous implying that we derive power and strength from within  
ourselves and not an outside source, and also stars are constantly in  
motion interacting with the gravitational pulls of the infinite other stars and  
systems.

109

Thelema posits that Hadit is “the flame that burns in every heart of  
man, and in the core of every star.”209 Crowley writes, “He is then your  
own inmost divine self; it is you, and not another, who are lost in the  
constant rapture of the embraces of Infinite Beauty.”210 In fact, Nuit tells us

208 This also attests to the universal import of mandala-like art pieces across cultures, for  
they are all expressions of that central point of consciousness and the apparent  
unfolding and expression of the psyche & universe around it. This was a subject of  
study for Carl Jung.  
209 Liber AL, II:6.  
210 Liber DCCCXXXVII: The Law of Liberty.

“Be thou Hadit, my secret centre, my heart & my tongue!”211 showing that  
we are intimately interconnected with divinity, mirroring the general  
Eastern sentiment of the soul’s link to God and the sentiment seen in the  
West in mystics like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos:  
“Thou art to know, that thy Soul is the Center, Habitation, and the  
Kingdom of God.”   
212

110

In a word, by saying “every man and every woman is a star,” we  
assert both the individual’s sovereignty and their divinity. Just as physical  
stars each have their unique course in the span of space, each individual is  
understood to have their own unique Will. In fact, “Thelema” itself means  
“Will” and this is the foundation of the entire philosophy of Thelema. It is  
said:  
“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.”   
213  
“There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.”   
214

110

These two statements clearly establish that everything in Thelema  
revolves around the dictum of “Do what thou wilt.” As Crowley often  
noted, this does not mean, “do what you like” but is a command to  
perform one’s “true” or “pure will” and nothing else. Liber AL proclaims,  
“Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say  
nay.”215

110

Now we can see the general point-of-view of existence formulated  
in Thelema: each individual is considered as a “star” whose sole right or  
duty is to perform their Will. In the core of this star is Hadit and about the  
star are the infinite space & possibilities of Nuit. We have established that  
each individual is at the center of his or her own universe, a “secret centre,  
heart, & tongue” of the divine, each performing their unique Will amidst  
Nuit, Infinite Space.

110

Since the Will is considered absolutely paramount in Thelema, we

213 Liber AL, I:40.  
214 Liber AL, III:60.  
215 Liber AL, I:42.

111

must understand how a Thelemite is supposed to “Will” things. Liber AL  
asserts something distinguished as “pure will” and explains its conditions:  
“For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of  
result, is every way perfect.”   
216  
Therefore, for will to be considered “pure” and “every way  
perfect” by the conditions set forth in Liber AL, it must be:  
1) “unassuaged of purpose” and  
2) “delivered from the lust of result”

111

The first consideration, “unassuaged of purpose,” has two  
meanings to be considered. The first is the more obvious, which is that  
will is impeded or weakened by “purpose” and it is meant to go on its way  
unrestricted by these notions of “purpose.” The mind and reason are  
generally an obstacle to the full expression of a person’s Will in many  
ways and this idea is treated in a later section more fully. The next  
consideration is simply that it means “with purpose unassuaged” or “with  
tireless energy.”217

111

Secondly, to be “delivered from the lust of result” means to be  
unaffected by or unattached to the results of one’s actions. This doctrine is  
a central tenet to the Eastern system of karma yoga where it is generally  
called “non-attachment to the fruits of action.” It might also be said that it  
is known to the West under the aphorism of “Art for art’s sake.” The  
Bhagavad Gita succinctly describes this doctrine of being “delivered from  
the lust of result” when it says,  
“Those whose consciousness is unified abandon all attachment to  
the results of action and attain supreme peace. But those whose  
desires are fragmented, who are selfishly attached to the results of  
their work, are bound in everything they do. Those who renounce  
attachment in all their deeds live content in the 'city of nine gates,'  
the body, as its master.”   
218

111

216 Liber AL, I:44.  
217 Liber II: The Message of the Master Therion.  
218 Bhagavad Gita, chapter 5.

112

Essentially, this line from Liber AL vel Legis means that to perform  
our “pure will” which “is every way perfect,” we must do our will with  
tireless energy, without regard to purpose, and without concern for results.  
Crowley wrote:   
“Thou must (1) Find out what is thy Will. (2) Do that Will with  
(a) one-pointedness, (b) detachment, (c) peace. Then, and then  
only, art thou in harmony with the Movement of Things, thy will  
part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God. And since the will  
is but the dynamic aspect of the self, and since two different selves  
could not possess identical wills; then, if thy will be God’s will,  
Thou art That.”   
219

112

In Liber AL, Nuit declares, “Invoke me under my stars! Love is the  
law, love under will.”220 Crowley explains that this means “while Will is the  
Law, the nature of that Will is Love. But this Love is as it were a by-product of that Will; it does not contradict or supersede that Will; and if  
apparent contradiction should arise in any crisis, it is the Will that will  
guide us aright.”221 Therefore the method or modus operandi of Thelema  
is “love under will,” which means the assimilation of experience in  
accordance with one’s Will.222

112

It must be recognized that “Love” in the context of Thelema and  
Liber AL is understood in a very universal way. It is not what most would  
consider the emotion of love or kindheartedness. Crowley writes, “Lo,  
while in The Book of the Law is much of Love, there is no word of  
Sentimentality. Hate itself is almost like Love!”223 for even hate is an  
experience worthy of our assimilation and integration. Instead, it

219 Liber II.  
220 Liber AL, I:57.  
221 Liber II.  
222 This harkens back to the Christian mystic Meister Eckhart who wrote, “The place  
where love has its being is only in the will; the person who has more will, also has  
more love. But no one knows about anyone else, whether one has more of it; that lies  
hidden in the soul, so long as God lies hidden in the soul’s ground. This love lies  
wholly in the will; whoever has more will, also has more love.” –excerpted from  
Counsels on Discernment (Counsel 10).  
223 Liber II.

113

essentially refers to all acts whatsoever, any “Change in conformity with  
Will,” for all actions are lawful and necessary. Crowley explains “Every  
event is a uniting of some one monad with one of the experiences possible  
to it,”224 and further that “Each action or motion is an act of love, the  
uniting with one or another part of 'Nuit'; each such act must be 'under  
will', chosen so as to fulfill and not to thwart the true nature of the being  
concerned.”225

113

Therefore, while “love” may refer specifically to acts of “union” (in  
the sense that sex is union on the physical plane, and samadhi   
226 is union  
on the mental plane), all experiences are understood as acts of “love” in  
the more universal sense that “every event is a uniting of some one monad  
with one of the experiences possible to it,” including acts of what may be  
perceived to be acts of “division.”

113

Now we can understand that “There is no law beyond Do what  
thou wilt,”227 and “love under will” is essentially the assimilation of  
experience in accordance with the nature of the individual. The  
conception mirrors Carl Roger’s228 propositions which are the assertions  
underlying his system of “client-centered therapy.” He writes as his sixth  
proposition,  
“The organism has one basic tendency and striving – to actualize,  
maintain and enhance the experiencing organism.”   
229

113

These acts of actualizing, maintaining, and enhancing the  
experiencing organism are what Thelema terms acts of “love.” The one

extensive to go into depth in this essay.

228 Carl Rogers (1902-1987) was one of the founders of the “humanistic” approach to  
psychology, he was one of the founders of psychotherapy research, he was the  
founder of the person-centered approach to therapy, and he was awarded by the  
American Psychological Association (of which he was the 55th president in 1947) with  
the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions in 1952 and the Award for  
Distinguished Professional Contributions to Psychology in 1972.  
229 Client-Centred Therapy, chapter 11.

114

condition that is important from the standpoint of Liber AL is that acts of  
“love” must be done “under will,” or in accordance with the nature of the  
particular circumstance and the individual (or the “organism” if we are to  
use Rogerian terminology). An act of “love under will” performed  
properly is what Carl Rogers would term “psychological adjustment” as  
opposed to “psychological maladjustment.” Rogers writes as his fourteenth  
and fifteenth propositions:  
“Psychological adjustment exists when the concept of the self is  
such that all the sensory and visceral experiences of the organism  
are, or may be, assimilated on a symbolic level into a consistent  
relationship with the concept of self.  
Psychological maladjustment exists when the organism denies  
awareness of significant sensory and visceral experiences, which  
consequently are not symbolized and organized into the gestalt of  
the self structure. When this situation exists, there is a basic or  
potential psychological tension.”   
230

114

“Psychological adjustment” consists in proper “assimilation” of  
experiences being equivalent to the “love under will” method of Thelema,  
whereas “psychological maladjustment” consists of the improper  
“assimilation” of experience, which creates “psychological tension.”  
Essentially, we can see that Thelema coincides with, and in a certain  
fashion anticipated, the Rogerian “propositions” that form the basis of his  
“client-centered therapy.”  
“All love is expansion, all selfisihness is contraction. Love is  
therefore the only law of life. He who loves lives, he who is selfish  
is dying. Therefore love for love’s sake, because it is law of life, just  
as you breathe to live.” –Swami Vivekananda

The Will: Absolute & Relative

114

There are two “planes” that one must consider the Will on for it to  
be understood completely. The first plane will be labeled the

114

230 Client-Centred Therapy, chapter 11.

115

“theoretical/absolute” and the second will be labeled “practical/relative.”  
As Aleister Crowley warns in many places, we are not to “confuse the  
planes” – that is, we must keep the considerations of each plane within its  
own sphere and not let the judgments that pertain to one be confused as  
pertaining to the other.

115

On the theoretical/absolute plane, everyone and everything is  
already doing its “true” or “pure” Will.   
“Know firmly, o my son, that the true Will cannot err; for this is  
thine appointed course in Heaven, in whose order is  
Perfection.”   
231  
“There are much deeper considerations in which it appears that  
'Everything that is, is right'...”   
232  
“The uninitiate is a 'Dark Star', and the Great Work for him is to  
make his veils transparent by 'purifying' them. This 'purification' is  
really 'simplification'; it is not that the veil is dirty, but that the  
complexity of its folds makes it opaque. The Great Work therefore  
consists principally in the solution of complexes. Everything in  
itself is perfect, but when things are muddled, they become  
'evil'.”   
233  
“…Each of us stars is to move on our true orbit, as marked out by  
the nature of our position, the law of our growth, the impulse of  
our past experiences. All events are equally lawful – and every one  
necessary, in the long run – for all of us, in theory; but in practise,  
only one act is lawful for each one of us at any given moment.  
Therefore Duty consists in determining to experience the right  
event from one moment of consciousness to another.”   
234

115

This last quotation touches on the pertinent issue of this short  
essay: “All events are equally lawful – and every one necessary, in the long

115

232 Magick in Theory & Practice, chapter 1.  
233 New Comment to Liber AL, I:8.  
234 Introduction to Liber AL.

116

run – for all of us, in theory.” This is the Will perceived from the  
theoretical/absolute plane – Crowley himself uses the terminology of “in  
theory” to describe this aspect. In an “absolute” sense, or from an  
“absolute” perspective, “all events are equally lawful – and every one  
necessary.”

116

He then writes, “but in practise, only one act is lawful for each one  
of us at any given moment… Duty consists in determining to experience  
the right event from one moment of consciousness to another.” This is the  
Will perceived from the practical/relative plane. In a relative sense, there is  
discrimination needed.

116

The first and most common “confusion of the planes” occurs when  
one perceives the truth of the theoretical/absolute plane of Will. In this  
sense, all events are lawful and necessary and there is no “wrong” or  
“evil.” This means in the world that no actions are to be restricted  
whatsoever because all things “work out in the end,” you might say. This  
will literally be the death of you if one decides to adopt the  
theoretical/absolute perspective as a practical/relative philosophy.  
Although the Will is “perfect” and “necessary” on the theoretical/absolute  
plane, there is a “Duty” that is the practical necessity of determining the  
action that is “right.”

116

The theoretical/absolute plane of Will is virtually useless on a  
practical level, although knowledge of the fact that Will cannot truly ever  
err may give rise to a certain confidence, detachment, and carefree  
attitude. It is on the practical/relative plane of existence that we normally  
function on, therefore a practical/relative understanding of Will is needed.

116

In Thelema, the practical/relative application of this is stated as,  
“Love is the law, love under will.”235 Love is the modus operandi of the  
Thelemite, and it must be “under will”:   
“Each action or motion is an act of love, the uniting with one or  
another part of 'Nuit'; each such act must be 'under will,' chosen so  
as to fulfill and not to thwart the true nature of the being  
concerned.”   
236

116

Therefore, the “Will” of Thelema must be considered as

116

235 Liber AL, I:57.  
236 Introduction to Liber AL.

117

simultaneously operating on two planes: the theoretical/absolute and the  
practical/relative. On the plane of the theoretical/absolute, all events are  
perfect, pure, & necessary; on the plane of the practical/relative, the  
Thelemite operates under the formula of “love under will,” assimilating  
experience in accordance with their unique nature.

117

The Will: Finite & Infinite

117

The central goal of Thelema is the discovery and accomplishment  
of one’s Will. It can be said that there are two aspects of the Will which  
must be discovered: the finite will and the infinite will, and both are  
necessary.

117

Aleister Crowley writes in De Lege Libellum:  
“The great bond of all bonds is ignorance. How shall a man be  
free to act if he know not his own purpose? You must therefore  
first of all discover which star of all the stars you are, your relation  
to the other stars about you, and your relation to, and identity  
with, the Whole. In our Holy Books are given sundry means of  
making this discovery, and each must make it for himself, attaining  
absolute conviction by direct experience, not merely reasoning  
and calculating what is probable. And to each will come the  
knowledge of his finite will, whereby one is a poet, one prophet,  
one worker in steel, another in jade. But also to each be the  
knowledge of his infinite Will, his destiny to perform the Great  
Work, the realization of his True Self.”

117

The infinite will is therefore tied up with the Great Work, in going  
beyond the body (Nephesh) and mind (Ruach) to reach the Secret Self in  
the Supernal Triangle (Neshamah-Chiah-Yechidah). It is entirely removed  
from one’s earthly position, proclivities, and ambitions and the perception  
of this Truth is open to all people. It is the goal of Yoga – complete  
dissolution in the Infinite, in the Beloved – and it is also the end of all true  
Magick, being directed towards Knowledge & Conversation of the Holy  
Guardian Angel and eventually the dissolution of the self in crossing the  
Abyss.

117

Whereas the infinite will unites us with that identity which one in  
essence and diverse in expression in each star, the finite will defines us as

118

a particular star in relation with other stars and the entire expanse of  
Space. Crowley writes in Liber ThIShARB, a book dedicated to the  
practice of magical memory: “This book is not intended to lead to the  
supreme attainment. On the contrary, its results define the separate being  
of the Exempt Adept from the rest of the Universe, and discover his  
relation to that Universe.” The finite will therefore refers to the karma of  
the particular individual – their specific point in space & time – where  
each person has their own different, unique will to follow out. This is the  
aspect of oneself where one discovers if poet, prophet, steel worker, or  
anything else, so to speak.

118

To find our will completely we must then both perform the Great  
Work of coming to know our True Selves beyond all manifestation along  
with understanding our particular star’s manifestation. To become truly  
One, we must become both None and Two.

118

The Will: Positive & Negative aspects

118

One of the most common misconceptions of Thelema is that “Do  
what thou wilt” is interpreted or promoted as “Do whatever you want.”  
Why is “Do what thou wilt” different from “Do what you want?” Is it also  
similar in some respects? To understand more clearly, we may examine  
the “positive” and “negative” aspects of Thelema/Will insofar as positive  
means affirming and negative means denying.

118

The negative aspect of “Do what thou wilt”

118

The negative aspect of “Do what thou wilt” and Thelema/Will in  
general refers to those tenets and suggestions which we may answer with a  
“No” or negatively.

118

The foremost idea that Thelema says “No” to is the idea of an  
absolute, binding morality and any kind of moral pronouncement. In this  
sense, “Do what thou wilt” is nearly identical to “Do what you want”  
because both deny that pronouncements of “You should/ought to do this  
or that” are irrelevant to our concerns. This is explained succinctly by  
Crowley when he writes:  
“The formula of this law is: Do what thou wilt. Its moral aspect is  
simple enough in theory. Do what thou wilt does not mean Do as  
you please, although it implies this degree of emancipation, that it

119

is no longer possible to say a priori that a given action is 'wrong.'  
Each man has the right – and an absolute right – to accomplish his  
True Will.”   
237

119

Here Crowley asserts that “Do what thou wilt” “implies [the same]  
degree of emancipation” as “Do as you please” insofar as “it is no longer  
possible to say a priori that a given action is 'wrong.'” This is the crux of  
the “negative aspect” of Thelema/Will – that one cannot argue against a  
certain action as bad, evil, not useful, unholy, et cetera. Crowley also  
writes:  
“There are no 'standards of Right.' Ethics is balderdash. Each Star  
must go on its orbit. To hell with 'moral Principle;' there is no such  
thing; that is a herd-delusion, and makes men cattle.”   
238

119

Again, each individual must have their own unique standards of  
what is right and wrong for them. The fact that there are no objective,  
external standards firmly allows us to do whatever we Will.

119

The positive aspect of “Do what thou wilt”

119

Insofar as morality and dogma are burdens upon the free exercise  
of one’s unique and individual Will, they are restrictions, and “the word of  
Sin is Restriction.”239 To this we may add the “dogs of Reason” with its  
questions of “Why” and “Because” for the Will is supra-rational and not to  
be limited by it. Again, the pressing question once one has discarded the  
fetters of restriction in their many forms is “What is my Will?” This comes  
to the aspect of Will to which we may say “Yes”…

119

The most succinct command in this “positive aspect” is that ancient  
aphorism and command to “Know Thyself.” This is where “Do what thou  
wilt” splits apart from and is superior to the simple notion of “Do what you  
want” or “Do as you please.” Most people do not even know what they

120

really want – what they really Will – and this requires an intense,  
continuing process of exploration and introspection. Traditionally, this is  
done by the methods of Magick and Yoga in Thelema. This allows us to  
not only control our body and mind but also explore the hidden regions  
and expand the understanding of ourselves to the uttermost. Crowley  
writes:   
“The value of any being is determined by the quantity and quality  
of those parts of the universe which it has discovered, and which  
therefore compose its sphere of experience. It grows by extending  
this experience, by enlarging, as it were, this sphere.”   
240  
Therefore we must use Magick, Yoga, and whatever methods we  
Will to explore ourselves and therefore manifest our Wills more fully,  
freely, purely, and perfectly.

120

With these considerations of both the negative & positive aspects of  
Thelema/Will, we may better understand the proclamation of the Master  
Therion when he says:  
“From [this], it should be clear that 'Do what thou wilt' does not  
mean 'Do what you like.' It is the apotheosis of Freedom; but it is  
also the strictest possible bond. Do what thou wilt – then do  
nothing else. Let nothing deflect thee from that austere and holy  
task. Liberty is absolute to do thy will; but seek to do any other  
thing whatever, and instantly obstacles must arise. Every act that is  
not in definite course of that one orbit is erratic, an hindrance. Will  
must not be two, but one.”   
241

120

The Will: The Will is Supra-Rational

120

“Our own Silent Self, helpless and witless, hidden within us, will  
spring forth, if we have craft to loose him to the Light, spring lustily  
forward with his cry of Battle, the Word of our True Wills.”   
242

120

240 “On Thelema” available in The Revival of Magick.  
241 Liber II.  
242 New Comment on AL, I:7.

121

The first question one might ask when embarking upon the quest  
to understand the philosophy of Thelema is “What is my Will?” or “How  
do I know what my Will is?” The answer to this questions might initially  
be presumed to be answerable in the form of a sentence such as “my Will  
is to be a doctor” or “my Will is to eat this sandwich,” but this is not so,  
for this is to restrict the Will to the trappings of language and reason. The  
Will is the innermost Motion of one’s being, an individual expression of  
the Eternal Energy of the cosmos.  
“The Way that can be named is not the Eternal Way.”   
243

121

To confine the Will to logical expression is to inherently assert a  
limit. Further, it assumes that one must have a logical reason for acting  
such-and-such way, but to do so would make one “fall down into the pit  
called Because” to “perish with the dogs of Reason.” 244 As Crowley  
remarked, “It is ridiculous to ask a dog why it barks,”245 for this is simply  
an expression of its nature, not determined by any kind of rational  
process.  
“One must fulfil one’s true Nature, one must do one’s Will. To  
question this is to destroy confidence, and so to create an  
inhibition… There is no 'reason' why a Star should continue in its  
orbit. Let her rip! Every time the conscious acts, it interferes with  
the Subconscious, which is Hadit. It is the voice of Man, and not of  
a God. Any man who 'listens to reason' ceases to be a  
revolutionary.”   
246

121

Again, to express one’s Will in terms of reason is to assert a limit.  
This is because of the inherently dualistic nature of not only logic & reason  
but language & thought themselves. To do this would be to drive a cleft  
into one’s being, fracturing it into multiplicity.

246 New Comment to Liber AL, II:30-31.

122

“Thoughts are false.” 247  
To experience and manifest one’s pure Will, one must not act out  
of notions of purpose nor out of desire for some pre-formed result or  
outcome.248 Both of these things are manifestations of the dualistic mind  
and restrict one unnecessarily to the trappings of logic. The Will can only  
be the genuine and spontaneous manifestation of one’s inmost nature, the  
united whole of one’s being.

Note: this is why I hate majors. They force me to pick some kind of pursuit that I’ll have to limit myself to for years-not just months-to come. With majors I cannot be who I am in the moment and allow my curiosity to direct me without expectation of where it will take me

122

Since “the word of Sin is Restriction,”249 the Will is certainly not  
deduced from the workings of the mind which, by its very nature, asserts  
division & separation and therefore restriction. When we clear away the  
morass of morality and the over-contemplated categories of metaphysics,  
the Will may more easily spring forward uninhibited.  
“In logic there is a trace of effort and pain; logic is self-conscious.  
So is ethics, which is the application of logic to the facts of life…  
Life is an art, and like perfect art it should be self-forgetting; there  
ought not to be any trace of effort or painful feeling. Life… ought  
to be lived as a bird flies through the air or as a fish swims in the  
water. As soon as there are signs of elaboration, a man is doomed,  
he is no more a free being. You are not living as you ought to live,  
you are suffering under the tyranny of circumstances; you are  
feeling a contract of some sort, and you lose your independence…  
Not to be bound by rules, but to be creating one’s own rules…”   
250

122

And this last point is important because Thelema is not illogical in  
that it wishes reason to be entirely abolished, but rather it wishes that it be  
put in its rightful place, under the governance of the Will. The mind is a  
harsh master and a good mistress, for once one realizes that one’s Will is  
not amenable to the dualisms of thought, once freed from one’s earlier  
bonds of logic, one may again employ reason to one’s benefit in those  
circumstances that call for it.

“It is not the object… to look illogical for its own sake, but to make  
people know that logical consistency is not final, and that there is a  
certain transcendental statement that cannot be attained by mere  
intellectual cleverness… When we say 'yes,' we assert, and by  
asserting we limit ourselves. When we say 'no,' we deny, and to  
deny is exclusion. Exclusion and limitation, which after all are the  
same thing, murder the soul; for is it not the life of the soul that  
lives in perfect freedom and in perfect unity? There is no freedom  
or unity… in exclusion or in limitation.”   
251

123

Here – outside logical dualisms, outside notions of ethics, purpose,  
and metaphysics – the Will can be known. This knowledge is not that of  
the mind which asserts duality – a knower and a thing known – but the  
experiential knowledge, the gnosis, of immersion in the flow of the world.  
Here the Eternal Will runs through oneself, is oneself, for “…mind, never  
at ease, creaketh “I”. This I persisteth not, posteth not through generations,  
changeth momently, finally is dead. Therefore is man only himself when  
lost to himself in The Charioting.”252 Therefore, one “knows” one’s Will in  
doing one’s Will. The Will that is not restricted by mental formulations  
springs freely from one’s innermost Self, crowned & conquering.  
“Life is fact and no explanation is necessary or pertinent. To  
explain is to apologize, and why should we apologize for living?  
To live – is that not enough? Let us then live!”

The Will: Thought Experiments

123

Here are a couple of thought-experiments to ponder the intricacies  
of what many people take to be simple on the face of things... There is no  
“right” answer to any of these but are meant to bring some subtle  
complications to light

123

1) Addiction:   
a) Suppose that someone is addicted to a substance or some

124

behavior. Does this mean that they are a priori NOT doing their  
Will?   
b) If you answer yes: Suppose that this person conquers their  
addiction and therefore learns more about themselves - they learn  
about their limitations and the extent of their willpower. Now are  
they doing their Will?   
c) Is the person doing their Will “better” or “more completely”  
because of this ordeal? If yes, then wouldn't this imply that going  
through addiction is beneficial to the development of Will?

Note: a fool who persists in his folly will become wise

124

2) The problem of other Wills:   
a) Suppose that person A does not enjoy what person B is doing.  
Does person A have a right to say that person B is not doing their  
Will?   
b) Suppose that person A feels he is being infringed upon by what  
person B is doing, but person B feels she is doing their Will. Does  
person A have a right to say that person B is not doing their Will?   
c) Suppose person A thinks person B is being irrational. Does  
person A have a right to say that person B is not doing their Will?  
Can person B point to the doctrines of Reason, Why, and Because  
being hindrances to assert her their position?  
d) Is there any circumstance where person A can be sure about  
their right to tell person B that they are not doing their Will?  
e) Is there any circumstance where person B can prove to person  
A that they are doing their Will?

124

3) Lust of result:  
a) Suppose Person A wants circumstance X to come about (for  
example, getting an A on a test, retrieving groceries, getting a  
paycheck, wooing some person, et cetera). Does this mean this  
person A suffers from “lust of result”? If so, should all desires for  
anything be destroyed?  
b) Suppose Person A does not achieve circumstance X. Is Person  
A's lamentation of this fact “lust of result”? Conversely: Suppose  
Person A does achieve circumstance X. Is Person A's celebration  
of this fact “lust of result”?

125

4) Pure will & duality:  
a) Suppose Person A has not attained to a Trance of Non-Duality/Unity. Is Person A a priori not doing their Will? Not doing  
their Will to the full extent? Are there different extents of doing  
one's Will or is it simply Doing your Will & Not doing your Will?  
b) Suppose Person A has attained to a Trance of Non-Duality/Unity but has “come down” from it - back to duality. Is  
Person A not doing their Will while in duality? Does the Trance of  
Non-Duality/Unity help this person to do their Will “better” or  
“more completely”?  
c) Suppose Person A enjoys a constant Trance of Non-Duality/Unity. Is this person necessarily doing their Will?

125

5) Killing others:  
a) Suppose Person A kills Person B. Was Person A a priori not  
doing their Will?  
b) Suppose Person A kills Person B out of self-defense. Was Person  
A not doing their Will?  
c) Suppose Person A kills Person B because Person B is infringing  
on their rights (a la Liber OZ). Was Person A not doing their Will?  
Was Person B a priori not doing their Will even if they think they  
are doing their Will?  
d) Suppose Person A kills Person B because they believe Person B  
is infringing on their rights. Was Person A not doing their Will?  
e) Suppose Person A kills Person B in a fit of ecstasy. Was Person  
A not doing their Will? Can Person A appeal to the ideas of  
Reason, Because, Why, et cetera, being hindrances in justifying this  
act?  
f) Suppose Person A decides to have an abortion. Was Person A  
not doing their Will? Suppose Person A knows that they do not  
have the means to support their baby. Was Person A not doing  
their Will in having an abortion?

125

6) A priori Will:  
a) Is it possible to say a priori that anyone else is not doing their  
Will in any circumstance? What circumstances?

139

CHAPTER 11  
THE RADICAL RE-ORIENTATION  
OF TRUE WILL

139

Wanting versus Willing

139

To Will and to want. These are not simply two ideas. To Will and  
to want are two fundamental ways of existing in the world. Our Law as  
Thelemites is “Do what thou wilt”; it is our sole duty and right to find and  
do this Will.   
Aleister Crowley often distinguished Will – often called True Will  
– from want. For example, he wrote that the purpose of each individual is:  
“...the discovery of his True Will (as opposed to his conscious  
ideals or wishes) by each individual.”   
278  
“It should be clear that 'Do what thou wilt' does not mean 'Do  
what you like.' It is the apotheosis of Freedom; but it is also the  
strictest possible bond.”   
279  
“Do what thou wilt does not mean Do as you please, although it  
implies this degree of emancipation, that it is no longer possible to  
say a priori that a given action is 'wrong.' Each man has the right—

139

278 The Constitution of the Order of Thelemites.  
279 Liber II.

140

and an absolute right—to accomplish his True Will.”   
280  
“It will be seen that the formula – 'Do what thou wilt shall be the  
whole of the Law' has nothing to do with 'Do as you please.' It is  
much more difficult to comply with the Law of Thelema than to  
follow out slavishly a set of dead regulations.”   
281

140

To Will and to want are two modes of existence. They are  
paralleled in the contrast between “to Be” and “to have.”282 In ordinary  
life, we are dominated by the mode of wanting or having at the expense of  
losing touch with Will or Being.

140

Wanting/Having

140

This ordinary mode of existence, wanting and having, can be  
likened to a horizontal line: we are always trying to achieve our desires, to  
have more things. This is everyone’s natural, “un-initiated” state of  
constant striving after possessing more and more. Society bombards us  
from all directions with the message that fulfillment is found through  
possessing more. Our wants are endless – there is always more to amass.  
We see this most evidently in the frenzy over the accumulation of wealth  
and material objects; we want the latest gadgets, the fastest cars, and the  
fanciest clothes. It can also be seen in wanting social status or authority, so  
we seek to have labels and titles that reflect our authority… “I am a CEO,”  
“I have a PhD,” “I am a 7th degree,” or “I am a High Priest.” The attitude  
of wanting extends into relationships: the more friends on Facebook, the  
better! Our possessiveness shows itself in our intimate relationships – it is  
even embedded in the language we use such as, “I have a boyfriend” or “I  
have a wife.” Wanting/having can be seen more subtly in the accumulation  
of knowledge. We want to have wisdom, so we accumulate facts – the  
person who can list the most correspondences of the Tree of Life is surely  
the wisest! Even our spirituality is not protected from this nefarious mode  
of existence. We amass (and occasionally read) shelves of books that  
could easily crush us under their combined weights, we strive to get the  
most ornate and beautiful ritual implements for our temples, we

140

280 “The Method of Thelema” available in The Revival of Magick.  
281 Eight Lectures on Yoga.  
282 See Erich Fromm's To Have or to Be?

141

accumulate a giant encyclopedia of knowledge of rituals and spiritual  
dogmas… we even speak of the goal of religion as a possession! They are  
the ultimate “wants”: We seek to obtain the Holy Grail or to find the  
Philosopher’s Stone, and we say that we “have” a True Will. Our  
absorption in this horizontal dimension of existence knows no bounds in  
terms of the unfathomable plethora of “wants.”

141

The modern age of technology has provided us the means to get  
more and more of what we want – friends through social networking sites,  
information through search engines, and all the food we could ever want  
at a supermarket (et cetera, ad infinitum). In spite of this, a fundamental  
characteristic of our modern era is widespread dissatisfaction and  
disenchantment. We have houses with heating and plumbing that kings  
could only wish for in past epochs, yet we are not content. We have 500  
friends on Facebook, yet we are lonely. We sail through the air in metal  
contraptions at unfathomable speeds, yet we are impatient. When we get  
down to it, what do we all hope to gain from this relentless pursuit of  
wants and accumulation of possessions? It stems from this deep,  
underlying sense that there is something lacking in our lives despite all the  
things we have. There is a hole and this hole is filled with stuff, whether  
material objects or knowledge or whatever else. We are looking for a  
sense of true fulfillment but the pursuit of our wants has left us no closer to  
our goal. In fact, all of our striving towards “having” makes us more  
dissatisfied: for everything we have, we also gain a fear of losing it.

141

We have everything backwards: our very preoccupation with  
wanting is the source of our lack. It is the source of our anxiety, our  
loneliness, our emptiness, our meaninglessness, and our sense of  
inauthenticity that we strove to extinguish by obtaining the objects of our  
desires. We want to be truly and authentically alive, yet – paradoxically –  
we have our hands so full with our “wants” and “haves” that we are left  
completely empty-handed.

141

Willing/Being

141

In the face of this delirious engrossment in the mode of wanting, it  
may seem that there is no other possible way of existing in the world. In  
contrast to this horizontal mode of preoccupation with wants, there is the  
vertical dimension of True Will, of Being. It is of note that the word  
“being” in Greek is “to on,” giving us the word “ontology” (the study of

142

being), and an ancient name of the sun was “On,” as is mentioned in the  
Gnostic Mass.283 The effulgent glory of Solar light is an apt symbol of the  
way of Being or True Will in contrast to the confused groping-in-the-darkness of the way of wanting.

142

To find a sense of self that is not empty and inauthentic, we do not  
need more desires and more possessions nor do we need more beliefs or  
knowledge. We need a radical re-orientation of our way of being in the  
world, one where we become who we are. This is what we of Thelema  
call the True Will. It is also of note, at least to occultists and Masons, that  
the word “reorient” means to get one’s bearings and etymologically means  
“to face the East,” i.e. to re-orient. We reorient ourselves to the East, the  
place of the rising Sun, which is a symbolic way of saying we reorient  
ourselves towards the way of Being or of True Will, remembering our  
starry nature, so to speak.

142

This vertical mode of being shows us symbolically that we are not  
simply striving towards more and more as in the horizontal mode of  
wanting. Instead, we extend upwards towards a loftier expression of  
ourselves and downwards towards a deeper understanding of ourselves. In  
our Holy Books it is written, “My adepts stand upright; their head above  
the heavens, their feet below the hells.”284 Instead of seeking after  
abundance through wanting and having things, we seek abundance in  
Being ourselves more fully, our True Selves. When we operate in this  
vertical dimension of True Will, religion is not something we adopt or  
“have,” our entire Being is religious. To be present in the vertical  
dimension of True Will is to be authentically religious.

142

The futility of Wanting

142

The fatuousness of our attempts to gain satisfaction through the  
pursuit of our conscious desires is illustrated by the Freudian model of the  
psyche as an iceberg. Above the water there is the tip of the iceberg: our  
sense of self or ego and our conscious desires. Beneath the water lies the  
immensity of the rest of our psyches, the unconscious. In our engrossment  
with our conscious wants, we let the mere tip of ourselves dictate our  
direction. The majority of the self that lies underwater, the unconscious, is  
left unheeded and unsatisfied. To reorient ourselves to Will instead of

142

283 “…our Lord and Father the Sun that travelleth over the Heavens in his name ON.”  
284 Liber Tzaddi, line 40.

143

want, Being instead of having, is to seek to encompass and express the  
totality of the self. It is to actualize the vast power and potential that lies  
dormant and untapped as long as we remain on the horizontal dimension  
of want and have. In fact, Crowley himself likened the Holy Guardian  
Angel285 and the True Will286 to the unconscious. He wrote, “Good sense is  
in reality common to all men: it is the property of the Unconscious whose  
Omniscience matches its Omnipotence. The trouble is that in practically  
every particular case the Intellect insists on interfering… Remember that  
the Ego is not really the centre and crown of the individual; indeed the  
whole trouble arises from its false claim to be so.”287

143

It might be said that, psychologically, the mode of wanting or  
having keeps us in a perpetual state of conflict between the ego/conscious  
and the unconscious. The mode of Willing or Being involves a  
harmonious alignment between conscious and unconscious. Crowley  
writes, “A Man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will is  
wasting his strength. He cannot hope to influence his environment  
efficiently. A Man who is doing his True Will has the inertia of the  
Universe to assist him.”288

143

Crowley's life as archetypal

143

Aleister Crowley’s own life serves as an archetypal template of this  
radical reorientation from a mode of wanting and having to that of Willing  
and Being.

145

Crowley wanted to become a great poet, a great  
diplomat, a great chess master… yet all of these things were found wanting,  
so to speak. He turned his eyes away from the possession of these titles  
and towards spiritual attainment, and the rest is history. In embarking  
upon the vertical path, he was led to the discovery of his True Will.

145

A parallel can be found in the life of Siddhartha Gautama who –  
upon seeing an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and then a yogi –  
renounced the possibility of being a king and having all the material  
comforts of the world and turned his attention toward becoming  
awakened. He found the answer to his gnawing dissatisfaction with the  
suffering of the world in enlightenment, in the vertical dimension of  
becoming who he really was, an awakened one, a Buddha. These two  
particularly good examples because they were men – not transcendent  
gods or demi-gods or mythical heroes – who represent the possibilities the  
actualization of potential that is available to all of us as men and women.  
William Blake described this attitude concisely when he wrote, “All deities  
reside in the human breast,”289 and, as it says at the top of our declaration  
of the rights of man, “There is no god but man.”290

145

To summarize, there is a horizontal dimension of being of “want”  
that is characterized by preoccupation with “having” or possessing,  
whether material objects, knowledge, or other people. We strive to  
assuage our anxiety about our sense of emptiness through pursuing our  
“wants,” which ironically leaves us feeling more empty and inauthentic. To  
transcend this condition, we do not need more “wants” or a new and  
specific “want,” but instead we need a radical reorientation of our very  
being towards the vertical dimension of “Will” (or True Will) that is  
characterized by a focus on “Being” rather than having. The process of  
shifting from want to Will, having to Being, horizontal to vertical, is shown  
symbolically or archetypally in the life of Aleister Crowley, specifically his  
experience of the “Vision of Sorrow.”

The Paradox of Human Existence:  
Our Simultaneous Independence and Interdependence

146

It has already been stated that there are two fundamental modes  
of existing in the world, (1) wanting, characterized by an attitude of  
“having” and (2) Willing, characterized by an attitude of “Being.” Wanting  
and having is inauthentic and the source and cause of perpetuation of  
anxiety. Willing and Being is authentic and the source of fulfillment. By  
“authentic” I mean that being in the mode of Willing is a state or process  
that is true to the totality one’s self, the actualization of one’s full potential.  
Conversely, “inauthentic” means we are limited in some way, as illustrated  
in the iceberg metaphor of the psyche mentioned previously where the the  
conscious ego is split from the unconscious potencies. To be inauthentic is  
therefore to avoid or limit the actualization of the full range of one’s  
possibilities; as it is written, “The word of Sin is Restriction.”292

146

These are two modes of existing in the world, but I want to turn  
our attention to the nature of our existence in the world. It is here that we  
encounter the paradox of human existence: we are always alone in the  
world and we are always with others in the world. There is a both an  
“Alone-ness” and “With-ness” that simultaneously characterize our  
existence in the world.

146

Crowley speaks to the paradoxicality

147

and inseparability of our simultaneous Independence and  
Interdependence when he writes, “It is not true to say either that we are  
separate Stars, or One Star. Each Star is individual, yet each is bound to  
the others by Law.”293

146

292 Liber AL, I:41.

147

293 New Comment to Liber AL, I:52.

147

This dualistic unity is paralleled in the first two chapters of The  
Book of the Law and, by extension, in the symbols of Hadit and Nuit.  
Hadit characterizes the quintessence of Alone-ness and even states “I am  
alone.”294 Nuit characterizes the quintessence of With-ness. She discloses  
that we are all stars in “the company of heaven”295 and counsels us to  
“Bind nothing! Let there be no difference made among you between any  
one thing & any other thing; for thereby there cometh hurt.”296 The  
ultimate unity between Alone-ness and With-ness is paralleled by the  
identification of Nuit with Hadit.297

147

The Independence / Interdependence duality can also be seen  
reflected in the two primary statements of our Law. “Do what thou wilt  
shall be the whole of the Law” is a statement of Alone-ness or  
Independence, i.e. that we each have an individual Will that is unique  
from all others. “Love is the law, love under will” is a statement of With-ness or Interdependence, i.e. that in every thought, word, and act we  
establish some kind of relation or union with the world. The ultimate unity  
between Alone-ness and With-ness is also paralleled by the identification  
of Will and Love.298

166

CHAPTER 12  
THELEMIC VALUES:  
A NEW VIEW OF MORALITY

166

Ye Olde Morality

166

Old morality consists essentially in the belief that there is  
an absolute law of conduct, often rewarded with promises of heaven or  
some kind of pleasure and punished with verdicts of various types of  
suffering, even eternal suffering in a fiery “Hell.”

166

insistence on sin and the  
punishment of hell following sinful actions.

166

Now, this old morality being by definition founded on a notion of  
“absolute moral conduct,” is also necessarily quite inflexible. Not only did

167

Moses invoke God as the source and authority of his commandments, but  
they were set in two gigantic tablets of stone.

167

In the course of history, one might say that these commandments,  
Jewish and otherwise, were necessary for that particular time. It can be  
agreed that many of these guidelines were (and still can be) effective if  
employed in the right circumstances, in the right cultures. For example,  
“keeping kosher,” a practice in Judaism, might be a highly effective way of  
being healthy in a certain part of a world, in a certain time-period. The  
fact is that these old moralities, as discussed above, emphasize the  
absoluteness of their rules and are therefore inflexible in their adaptation  
to individual circumstances. Nietzsche described this old morality, cognate  
with the Freudian “superego,” as “the great dragon” that plagues each  
person in their development:  
“What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to  
call Lord and God? 'Thou-shalt,' is the great dragon called. But the  
spirit of the lion saith, 'I will.'  
'Thou-shalt,' lieth in its path, sparkling with gold--a scale-covered  
beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, 'Thou shalt!' The  
values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus  
speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: All the values of things glitter  
on me. All values have already been created, and all created  
values do I represent. Verily, there shall be no 'I will' any more.  
Thus speaketh the dragon.”   
342  
This dragon is contrasted with the lion, a symbol of a certain stage  
of the “metamorphosis of one's spirit,” which corresponds with the  
discarding of this old morality.

167

Discarding of Old Morality

167

342 Nietzsche, Friedrich. Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

167

“Anthropologists, archæologists, physicists and other men of  
science, risking thumbscrews, stake, infamy and ostracism, have  
torn the spider-snare of superstition to shreds and broken in pieces

168

the monstrous idol of Morality, the murderous Moloch which has  
made mankind its meat throughout history... Moral philosophy,  
psychology, sociology, anthropology, mental pathology,  
physiology, and many another of the children of Wisdom, of  
whom she is justified, well know that the laws of Ethics are a chaos  
of confused conventions, based at best on customs convenient in  
certain conditions, more often on the craft or caprice of the  
biggest, the most savage, heartless, cunning and blood-thirsty  
brutes of the pack, to secure their power or pander to their  
pleasure in cruelty.”   
343

168

The 18th and 19th centuries signaled the slow demise of the  
conventional views of an Absolute Law of morals. This is epitomized in  
Nietzsche's proclamation that “God is dead.” The essential realization that  
had crept in was that moral judgment of things is entirely relative.  
Amazingly, Einstein announced the relativity of space-time itself less than  
half a century later. Nietzsche also summarized this relativization of morals  
in one aphorism: “There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a  
moral interpretation of phenomena.”344 In this, we come to see that  
morality as we know it lies entirely in our particular interpretation of  
phenomena, it does not reside in the phenomena themselves.

168

Thelema was surely the first religious philosophy to adopt – or  
rather incorporate – this new notion of the relativity of morality. This idea  
is more fully expanded in various other essays.345  
It is proclaimed in Liber AL vel Legis, the central text of Thelema:  
“Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.”  
“There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.”   
346  
The will being unique to each individual, their different Laws are  
essentially not going to be identical. This most definitely states that each  
person is to do their own Will and not follow out the various laws and  
mandates of others. Naturally, moral sanctions imposed from without are

343 Liber V vel Reguli.  
344 Nietzsche, Friedrich. Beyond Good and Evil.  
345 See, for example, chapter 5 of this book.  
346 Liber AL, I:40, III:60.

169

discarded. The discarding of old morality during the last two centuries is  
also reflected into the microcosm of each human individual. Each man  
and woman must go through the various stages of human development,  
and a large part of this development is one's continually changing  
approach to values. In the process of all of our lives, we have each  
adopted values and many of us, especially during adolescence, begin to  
question our adopted values that we took initially to be true.

169

This questioning of values is what Nietzsche discusses in his classic  
Thus Spoke Zarathustra. He declared there were three metamorphoses of  
the spirit, the first of which is the camel that essentially takes on the values  
of the society it was born into. Next, through necessity, the lion emerges,  
symbolic of the discarding of introjected values. On this symbolic lion of  
the spirit Nietzsche writes:  
“My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit?  
Why sufficeth not the beast of burden [the camel], which  
renounceth and is reverent?  
To create new values – that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish:  
but to create itself freedom for new creating – that can the might of  
the lion do. To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even  
unto duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the lion.  
To assume the right to new values – that is the most formidable  
assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such  
a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey. As its holiest,  
it once loved 'Thou-shalt': now is it forced to find illusion and  
arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may capture freedom  
from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.”   
347

The prime characteristic of this lion-like attitude is “to create itself  
freedom” by rejecting the “Thou-shalts” of values imposed from without.  
Modernly, the old morality is represented to the modern individual in the  
form of “society” or “the State,” which are imposed from without. This  
lion symbol Nietzsche speaks of is essentially the breaking free of old  
perspectives of value. These include any imposed values acquired

throughout one's development in modern society, especially those of old  
morality.

170

In the field of psychology, Carl Ransom Rogers – an influential  
psychologist who founded the client-centered form of therapy and was  
president of the American Psychological Association – delineated the  
progress of our approach to values throughout our individual  
development. To understand the transition to what Rogers terms a  
“psychologically mature” outlook on values we must first understand  
completely his model of the development of values. He first of all  
distinguishes between “operative values” which refers to “the tendency of  
any living beings to show preference, in their actions, for one kind of  
object or objective rather than another... [which] need not involve any  
cognitive or conceptual thinking,”348 and what he calls “conceived values,”  
which are “the preference of the individual for a symbolized object...  
[where] usually in such a preference there is anticipation or foresight of the  
outcome of behavior directed toward such a symbolized object.”349 For  
operative values, Rogers gives the example of a worm navigating a maze  
by choosing the directions through it; for conceived values, he gives the  
example of the value-statement “honesty is the best policy.” With this  
subtle distinction in values we may return to the subject of becoming a  
psychologically mature adult.

170

Rogers suggested that there are three distinct perspectives or stages  
of value: the infant, the psychologically immature, and the psychologically  
mature adult. The infant's view of values is inborn - it has “at the outset, a  
clear approach to values. He prefers some things and experiences, and  
rejects others. We can infer from studying his behavior that he prefers  
those experiences which maintain, enhance, or actualize his organism, and  
rejects those which do not serve this end.”350 This infant stage of values is  
entirely composed of operative values, for conceived values require  
symbolic thought of which infants are not even capable. The fact that is  
asserted is that infants are inborn with a sense of valuing things, which  
corresponds to what Rogers calls elsewhere the “actualizing tendency,”

170

348 Rogers, Carl R. “Toward a Modern Approach to Values: The Valuing Process in the  
Mature Person” from Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Vol.68, No.2, pg.  
160-167.  
349 Ibid.  
350 Ibid.

171

which is that tendency of all humans (not just infants) to inherently move  
towards “those experiences which maintain, enhance, or actualize his  
organism,” as previously mentioned. Rogers continues, explaining that the  
infant's approach to values “is first of all a flexible, changing, valuing  
process, not a fixed system... What is going on seems best described as an  
organismic valuing process, in which each element, each moment of what  
he is experiencing is somehow weighed, and selected or rejected,  
depending on whether, at this moment, it tends to actualize the organism  
or not. This complicated weighing of experience is clearly an organismic,  
not a conscious or symbolic function. These are operative, not conceived  
values.”351 The last aspect of the infant's approach to values is that “the  
source or locus of the evaluating process is clearly within himself. Unlike  
many of us, he knows what he likes and dislikes, and the origin of these  
value choices lies strictly within himself. He is the center of the valuing  
process, the evidence for his choices being supplied by his own senses.”352  
Essentially, the infant's approach to values is what Rogers terms the  
“organismic valuing process,” wherein each phenomenon is weighed and  
rejected depending on its potential for actualizing the individual in  
question, and the source of the evaluating process is clearly within the  
individual.

171

One would think that this soundly based and highly efficient  
valuing process would not be worth giving up. The fact is that all of us  
exchange this apparent effective valuing process for a more “rigid,  
uncertain, inefficient approach to values which characterizes most of us  
adults.”353 The reason for this, Rogers posits, is essentially the need for love  
from others, especially the parents. “The infant needs love, wants it, tends  
to behave in ways which will bring a repetition of this wanted experience.  
But this brings complications.”354 Each child is scolded for doing things the  
parent sees as unacceptable and rewarded for things viewed as acceptable.  
These various value judgments become adopted by the infant as if they  
were his own, which is called the “introjection of values.” Rogers explains,  
“He has deserted the wisdom of his organism, giving up the locus of  
evaluation, and is trying to behave in terms of values set by another, in

171

351 Ibid.  
352 Ibid.  
353 Ibid.  
354 Ibid.

172

order to hold love.”355 It this new stage, when the infant begins to start  
introjecting values from outside as if they were his own, which  
corresponds with Nietzsche's notion of the camel. The camel is that which  
delights in bearing heavy loads, in this case the burden of introjected  
values. On this Nietzsche writes:  
“What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it  
down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden. What is the  
heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may  
take it upon me and rejoice in my strength... All these heaviest  
things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself.”   
356

172

These introjected values in the individual corresponds as a  
microcosm to the old morality, discussed earlier, that has appeared in the  
course of human history. Rogers writes that “because these [introjected]  
concepts are not based on his own valuing, they tend to be fixed and  
rigid, rather than fluid and changing.”357 Like introjected value concepts,  
the old morality is inherently fixed and rigid. Our lives as children,  
through when we are adolescents, up until we become adults, we are  
constantly introjecting values from around us. Rogers notes that, “in this  
fantastically complex culture of today, the patterns we introject as  
desirable or undesirable come from a variety of sources and are often  
highly contradictory in their meanings.”358 This assimilation into society  
with its values creates this “highly contradictory” feeling within each  
person. Most adults are at this stage of tension between their various  
conceived values that they have introjected, and more importantly Rogers  
describes the “wide and unrecognized discrepancy between the evidence  
supplied by his own experience and these conceived values.”359 This is  
because his experience no longer dictates his values as they did as an  
infant when his locus of evaluation was still within himself. Now, this  
source of evaluation lies outside of himself in most matters because of  
these fixed introjected values that he has adopted. One consequence of

172

356 Nietzsche, Friedrich. Thus Spoke Zarathustra.  
357 Rogers, Carl. “Toward a Modern Approach to Values.”  
358 Ibid.  
359 Ibid.

173

these introjected values being fixed is that “he must hold [these  
conceptions] in a rigid and unchanging fashion. The alternative would be  
a collapse of his values.”360 Rogers believed that this picture of the  
individual, that of one with a large discrepancy between their experience  
and their introjected, conceived values, “is the picture of most of us.” 361  
On this fundamental discrepancy Rogers wrote:  
“By taking over the conceptions of others as our own we lose  
contact with the potential wisdom of our own functioning, and lose  
confidence in ourselves. Since these value constructs are often  
sharply at variance with what is going on in our own experiencing,  
we have in a very basic way divorced ourselves from ourselves,  
and this accounts for much of modern strain and insecurity. This  
fundamental discrepancy between the individual's concepts and  
what he is actually experiencing, between the intellectual structure  
of his values and the valuing process going on unrecognized within  
him - this is a part of the fundamental estrangement of modern  
man from himself.”   
362

173

It is at this point in development, where there is a fundamental  
discrepancy and dissonance in ourselves, that Nietzsche's lion is needed  
“create itself freedom” by discarding the old values of "the great dragon"  
of “Thou shalt not”s. Before, as a camel, the individual takes on and  
introjects the values of his society at large, moving his source of evaluation  
from a fluid center within himself to a fixed set of values outside of  
himself. This process is most likely necessary for all humans to go through,  
even though it has “divorced ourselves from ourselves.” It is at this point  
that the lion is needed, which is essentially symbolic of the discarding of  
old values. This lion in its rejecting of introjected values is a symbol of the  
transition from this psychologically immature outlook of values to  
becoming what Rogers called a psychologically mature adult. Rogers said  
that “some individuals are fortunate in... developing further in the  
direction of psychological maturity.”363 Being a therapist he naturally

173

361 Ibid.

174

recommends the therapeutic climate for this further development but also  
admitted that this development can also happen in life where various  
conditions are similar to therapy.

174

The Birth of a New System of Values

174

If we discard our own introjected values, what do we have left?  
This dimension is what many other essays on Thelemic morals have  
neglected. Once the lion has found the old set of values ineffective and  
useless, what takes the place of this new void? Is “Do what thou wilt”  
simply just a call to complete chaos and anarchy?

174

As we begin to discard these introjected values, we come again to  
an approach to values that is similar to the infant's perspective treated  
earlier. In this sense, “it is fluid, flexible, based on this particular moment,  
and the degree to which this moment is experienced as enhancing and  
actualizing. Values are not held rigidly, but are continually changing.”364  
This return to a fluid and flexible approach to values can only happen  
when we relinquish our attachment to various conceived values that have  
been introjected. The experience of our organism, which is constantly  
changing, becomes more important to the evaluation process than the  
thought structure of our values. Also in similarity with the infant's  
perspective, this new mature approach establishes, “the locus of  
evaluation... firmly within the person. It is his own experience which  
provides the value information or feedback. This does not mean that he is  
not open to all the evidence he can obtain from other sources. But it  
means that this is taken for what it is - outside evidence - and is not as  
significant as his own reactions.”365 Further, “there is also involved in this  
valuing process a letting oneself down into the immediacy of what one is  
experiencing, endeavoring to sense and to clarify all its complex  
meanings”366 just like in infancy. Essentially, one returns largely to the  
infant's point-of-view insofar as one's values are more fluid & flexible, the  
locus of evaluation is re-established within oneself, experiential evidence  
trumps outside evidence, and a sort of letting go to be “in the moment.”

174

174

Amazingly enough, as Carl Rogers says this new psychologically

175

mature look has much in common with the infant's perspective, Nietzsche  
designates the stage after the discarding of values by the lion as that of the  
child. He writes:  
“But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the  
lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a  
child?   
Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game,  
a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea. Aye, for the  
game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto  
life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world  
winneth the world's outcast.”   
367

175

The child is “innocence” because he does not reference his own  
actions against the values of others (whereby one feels guilt, shame, et  
cetera, for not complying) but of his own, he is “forgetfulness” because his  
values are not a fixed system but a fluid, ever-changing process, and he is  
“a new beginning” and “a first movement” because his values are always  
renewed in each moment, each calling a new judgment from his being.  
The child is “a game” because he does not take the following of  
introjected values so seriously anymore – in fact, finds those following  
them quite ignorant (Rogers writes that, “[the infant] would laugh at our  
concern over values, if he could understand it”368), he is “a self-rolling  
wheel” because his locus of evaluation has been relocated to within  
himself, and he is “a holy Yea” because in this bringing of valuing into the  
locus of oneself naturally brings one into being more accepting of  
experience in general.

175

This image of the mature child appears in an injunction by Christ  
to “become as little children,”369 and also Blavatsky's injunction, “The  
Pupil must regain the child-state he has lost,”370 and finally Nietzsche's own  
injunction “Maturity in a man: that means having found once again that

176

seriousness which man had as a child, in play.”371

176

Rogers emphasizes that similar to the infant, “the psychologically  
mature adult trusts and uses the wisdom of his organism, with the  
difference that he is able to do so knowingly. He realizes that if he can  
trust all of himself, his feelings and his intuitions may be wiser than his  
mind, that as a total person he can be more sensitive and accurate than his  
thoughts alone.”372 As emphasized in Thelema,373 reason cannot  
adequately be the guide of the Will. Rogers offers this “organismic valuing  
process” as a solution to not only what may guide our actions when we  
discard reason as the sole arbiter, but also it fills the vacuum created by  
our questioning and discarding of values. The “child” of Nietzsche who  
creates his own values is one who has adopted this psychologically mature  
“organismic valuing process.” Like Rogers, we assert that “there is an  
organismic base for an organized valuing process within the human  
individual... It is part of the functioning life process of any healthy

177

organism. It is the capacity for receiving feedback information which  
enables the organism continually to adjust its behavior and reactions so as  
to achieve the maximum possible self-enhancement.”374 This natural  
inclination is with us since birth and consequently covered over with our  
adopted of various conceived values in our need for love and esteem.  
Now as we being to question and discard our various conceived values  
that have been imposed from without, we are re-adopting many facets of  
this natural organismic valuing process yet with the psychological maturity  
and insight of the adult.

177

Finally, some often question whether relocating our valuing process  
within ourselves will result in widespread anarchy. Carl Rogers assures  
that although this process of organismic valuing is entirely individual, the  
values that are created share a large degree of commonality across  
humanity. He asserted that “where individuals are valued, where there is  
greater freedom to feel and to be, certain value directions seem to emerge.  
These are not chaotic directions but instead have a surprising  
commonality... this commonality does not seem to be due to the  
influences of any one culture... I like to think that this commonality of  
value directions is due to the fact that we all belong to the same species...  
As a species there may be certain elements of experience which tend to  
make for inner development and which would be chosen by all  
individuals if they were genuinely free to choose.”375 In fact, Rogers was  
able to identify various common themes, or “value directions,” that arise  
when individuals are accepted and left free to choose their own values:   
“They tend to move away from facades... pretense, defensiveness,  
putting up a front... they tend to move away from 'oughts'... they  
tend to move away from meeting the expectations of others...  
being real is positively valued... self-direction is positively  
valued...one's self, one's own feelings, come to be positively  
valued... being a process [as opposed to being fixed] is positively  
valued... sensitivity to others and acceptance of others is positively  
valued... deep relationships are positively valued... perhaps more  
than all else, the [individual] comes to value an openness to all of

177

374 Ibid.  
375 Ibid.

178

his inner and outer experience.”

178

376 Ibid.

178

Although these may be general trends of “value directions,” in  
Thelema it is recognized quite firmly that “There is no law beyond Do  
what thou wilt.” Instead of dogmatically imitating these apparently  
common stances on values, we may recognize that the very fact of a  
commonality of value directions among all humans who are relatively free  
and esteemed shows us that this process of understanding values that we  
all go through does not end in complete anarchy as some criticize.  
Essentially, “a new kind of emergent universality of value directions  
becomes possible when individuals move in the direction of psychological  
maturity, or more accurately, move in the direction of becoming open to  
their experiencing.”377

CHAPTER 3  
YAMA & NIYAMA:  
WHAT IS THE “IDEAL THELEMITE”?

32

What is the “ideal Thelemite”? In short: There is no such thing as  
an “ideal Thelemite.” The Law of Thelema is “Do what thou wilt,” which  
means that every individual is sovereign. Every man and every woman has  
their own individual Law, their own unique Will. As William Blake said,  
“One Law for the Lion and the Ox is Oppression.”15

32

The fact that “There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt”16 is  
precisely why there are no standard or universal ideals. Each individual  
has their own Will, and each Law must have its own, unique “ideal.”  
Regarding the fact that there are no standards or universal ideals, Crowley  
writes:   
“What is necessary is not to seek after some fantastic ideal, utterly  
unsuited to our real needs, but to discover the true nature of those

32

15 The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  
16 Liber AL, III:60.

33

needs, to fulfill them, and rejoice therein.”   
17  
“Know then, o my Son, that all Laws, all Systems, all Customs, all  
Ideals and Standards which tend to produce Uniformity, being in  
direct Opposition to Nature’s Will to change and to develop  
through Variety, are accursèd.”   
18  
“Each child must develop its own Individuality, and Will,  
disregarding alien Ideals… Let children educate themselves to be  
themselves. Those who train them to standards cripple and deform  
them. Alien ideals impose parasitic perversions… Standards of  
education, ideals of Right-and-Wrong, conventions, creeds, codes,  
stagnate Mankind.”   
19

33

One might argue that Thelema is itself a “universal ideal.”  
Thelema is a universal Law insofar as “Do what thou wilt” states that each  
individual must find their own unique Will, their own particular Law. The  
universal ideal is therefore that there are no universal ideals: each must  
“discover the true nature of [one's real] needs, to fulfill them, and rejoice  
therein.”20 The only absolute is that there are no absolutes; the only  
constant is change.

33

In a way, then, we can say that the “ideal Thelemite” is one who  
does their own Will and lets others do their Wills. This “ideal Thelemite”  
follows their own Law and others follow their own, different Laws; there  
are no universal ideals of “what is best” or “what is absolutely Right and  
Wrong” beyond this. This is what is sometimes called the “Yama and  
Niyama of Thelema.”

33

We borrow the terms “Yama” and “Niyama” from the Hindu  
system of raja yoga as explained, among other places, in Patanjali’s classic  
treatise called the Yogasutras. Yama and Niyama are words that mean  
opposite things, similar to “Thou shalt not” (Yama) and “Thou shalt”  
(Niyama). Unfortunately, translating them into English is not easy, but  
their real meaning in the context of Thelema becomes clear with just a

34

little explication.

34

The Yama of Thelema is to have the self-discipline to find one’s  
own Will and to do that Will. As it is said, “Thou hast no right but to do  
thy will.”21 The Niyama of Thelema is to mind your own business or, in  
other words, to allow others to find and do their Wills. The Niyama is to  
extend the same absolute liberty to do your own Will that you rightfully  
claim to all other individuals. In short:  
• The Yama of Thelema: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the  
Law. Thou hast no right but to do thy will.  
• The Niyama of Thelema: Mind your own business.

34

Yama: Crowley mentions that Yama means something similar to  
“control” or “the word 'inhibition' as used by biologists.”22 Basically, Yama  
means the self-discipline to remain on the “track” or “path” of one’s True  
Will and not swerving from it. “Thou hast no right but to do thy will,”23  
which shows that you are by definition outside of your sole right when you  
deviate from your Path. This requires the self-discipline to remain true to  
one’s own Law. As Crowley writes, “What is true for every School is  
equally true for every individual. Success in life, on the basis of the Law of  
Thelema, implies severe self-discipline.”24 Crowley gives a succinct  
summary of the Yama of Thelema when he writes:  
“I wish to thunder forth once more that no questions of right or  
wrong enter into our problems. But in the stratosphere it is 'right'  
for a man to be shut up in a pressure-resisting suit electrically  
heated, with an oxygen supply, whereas it would be 'wrong' for  
him to wear it if he were running the three miles in the summer  
sports. This is the pit into which all the great religious teachers  
have hitherto fallen, and I am sure you are all looking hungrily at  
me in the hope of seeing me do likewise. But no! There is one  
principle which carries us through all conflicts concerning conduct,  
because it is perfectly rigid and perfectly elastic: — 'Do what thou

22 Eight Lectures on Yoga.  
23 Liber AL, I:42.  
24 Magick Without Tears, chapter 8.

35

wilt shall be the whole of the Law.' That is Yama.”

35

Niyama: There is no “opposite term” of Yama, or self-discipline, to  
adequately translate “Niyama.” We might say that the complementary  
term of “self-discipline “is, in this case, something like “other-discipline.” If  
Yama is the discipline we have toward ourselves in remaining true to our  
own Law, Niyama is the discipline we have toward others in allowing  
them to remain true to their own Laws. This “other-discipline” can be  
summarized as “Mind your own business.” Crowley says as much in  
several places:  
“Mind your own business! is the sole sufficient rule.”   
26  
“I will have thee to know, moreover, my dear Son, the right Art of  
Conduct with them whom I shall give thee for Initiation. And the  
Rule thereof is one Rule: Do that thou wilt shall be the whole of  
the Law. See thou constantly to it that this be not broken;  
especially in the Section thereof (if I dare say so) which readeth  
Mind thine own Business. This is of Application equally to all, and  
the most dangerous Man (or Woman, as has occurred, or I err) is  
the Busy-body. Oh how ashamed are we, and moved to  
Indignation, seeing the Sins and Follies of our Neighbours!”   
27  
“Every Star has its own Nature, which is 'Right' for it. We are not  
to be missionaries, with ideal standards of dress and morals, and  
such hard-ideas. We are to do what we will, and leave others to do  
what they will. We are infinitely tolerant, save of intolerance.”   
28  
“It is necessary that we stop, once for all, this ignorant meddling  
with other people’s business. Each individual must be left free to  
follow his own path.”

36

The name Crowley gives for someone who fails to uphold the  
Niyama of Thelema is a “busy-body.” A busy-body is someone who is  
concerned about what other people are doing, how other people are  
doing things, and why other people are doing things. A busy-body is  
concerned about someone else’s True Will rather than being concerned  
with their own. They are indignant about the “sins and follies” of their  
neighbors rather than focusing on themselves, and generally meddle in  
others’ affairs. A busy-body, in short, does not mind their own business.

36

We are all busy-bodies to some degree or another whenever we  
impose our standards, expectations, or ideals on others, whenever we  
think that “we know best” for anyone other than ourselves. This can be  
anything from the most mundane and concrete such as criticizing  
another’s choice in clothing to the more subtle such as expecting others to  
perform the same spiritual practices as oneself or insisting that people who  
believe something different from oneself must be “corrected.”

36

When put into practice, we quickly see that the Niyama of  
Thelema – that of minding one’s own business and allowing others to do  
their Wills – is not simply a limp passivity. It is not “grinning and bearing  
it,” which implies that – deep down – you actually don’t want them to do  
their Wills (let alone that you obviously aren’t rejoicing in it!). The Niyama  
of Thelema is an active, positive thing: we actively affirm the right of each  
individual to know and do their True Will. When we greet one another,  
we look fearlessly into each others’ eyes and say, “Do what thou wilt shall  
be the whole of the Law.” This is to say to everyone you meet, as Crowley  
writes, “Look, brother, we are free! Rejoice with me, sister, there is no law  
beyond Do what thou wilt!”30

36

Some might say that it takes strength to control everything, but it is  
a much greater strength to not need to control everything and everyone. It  
is a symptom of being unsure and anxious to feel the need to control  
people by insisting that it’s your way or the highway. That is: Being a busy-body is a symptom of weakness and fear, although it will inevitably mask  
itself in the “virtue” that essentially comes down to “knowing what is best”  
for someone else (let alone all other Thelemites!). That is where  
“compassion” and “altruism” and even “teaching” teeters into the realm of  
folly.

36

We will all inevitably hear (or probably have already heard) some

self-avowed Thelemite question why others are not doing this or that,  
insisting they are complaining about others because they “really care”  
about Thelema. Many of us have fallen prey to this ourselves (“Oh no!  
Definitely not me!” … Yes, you especially!). This “care” – this “noble  
cause” of ours – is nothing but the demands of a busy-body cloaking itself  
in guise of “virtue.” We all should remember to “veil not your vices in  
virtuous words.”31 This “care” basically comes down to insisting that  
everyone else must have the same values as yourself, which is exactly  
opposite to affirming “Do what thou wilt.” If you ever find yourself asking,  
or hear someone else asking, something that amounts to “Why doesn’t this  
other person/these other people think that this is important?” The answer  
is most likely “Because it isn't important to them, nor does it need to be”…  
or, more pointedly, “Mind your own business.” This is why there is no  
“ideal Thelemite.” This is why “One Law for the Lion and the Ox is  
Oppression.” Any insistence otherwise will quickly fall into the same trap  
that characterized the Old Aeon, the tyranny of a single standard or ideal  
for all people, rather than a multiplicity of Laws, each uniquely suited to  
the individual.

37

Again: The Niyama of Thelema is not a limp, passive, “grin and  
bear it” quality. On the contrary: It takes an active, almost virile quality to  
say to every individual, “I don’t know what your Will is, I don’t know  
what your 'good' or 'bad' are, I don’t even know how your Will may  
interact with and effect mine, but I grant you the absolute right to do your  
Will and I claim the equally absolute right to do my Will.” This is far  
from a passive “letting things happen”; the Niyama of Thelema is an active  
affirmation, an enthusiastic encouragement, a joyous battle-cry for each  
and every man and woman to discover their real needs, to fulfill them,  
and to rejoice therein. To believe otherwise is the essence of tyranny; to  
act otherwise is the essence of oppression. This requires the strength to  
stand in the midst of uncertainty and ambiguity, of accepting variety and  
difference of style and opinion, of not knowing “how everything should  
be” for everyone or anyone else. Any concern arising about others “not  
doing it the right way” should be a reminder to us all to re-focus on our  
own Will: this should be a reminder of the Yama of staying true to our  
own Path and the Niyama of affirming the right of others to be true to  
their Paths.

This is the simplicity and the beauty of the Law of Thelema: There  
are no absolute standards or universal ideals. Every man and every  
woman has the indefeasible right and duty to know and do his or her  
True Will. Each has their own standard, their own Law. Any occurrence  
of someone imposing their Law on another, or anyone accepting a Law  
imposed on them by another, is a distortion and deforming of a star’s true  
nature. It is our Yama to adhere to this Law of our own True Will, and it  
is our Niyama to affirm the right of every other individual to adhere to the  
Law of his or her own True Will. This is real Freedom, the perfect order  
on Earth as the stars move seamlessly in the perfect order in the Heavens;  
this why our Law of “Do what thou wilt” is the Law of Liberty itself.

CHAPTER 2  
THE MANIFESTO OF RA-HOOR-KHUIT

28

The knight-monks – the prince-priests and the hermit-soldiers – are  
the body of Ra-Hoor-Khuit’s Army. They are not the cloistered and  
emasculated hermits of old.  
Although we too attain to the truth of Mystic Solitude wherein All  
is One and we proclaim, “I am alone: there is no God where I am” (AL,  
II:23), we immerse ourselves into the fecundity of the world instead of  
retreating therefrom. Work your jobs, do your duties, raise your children,  
laugh with friends, but let all these things, from the most important to the  
most trivial, be to the Glory of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!  
“Behold! these be grave mysteries; for there are also of my friends  
who be hermits. Now think not to find them in the forest or on the  
mountain; but in beds of purple, caressed by magnificent beasts of  
women with large limbs, and fire and light in their eyes, and  
masses of flaming hair about them; there shall ye find them. Ye  
shall see them at rule, at victorious armies, at all the joy; and there  
shall be in them a joy a million times greater than this.”  
– Liber AL, II:24

Note: “AMASS GREAT WEALTH. NEVER BECOME ATTACHED TO WHAT YOU OWN. BE PREPARED TO DESTROY ALL THAT YOU OWN”

29

We are not to shun material objects, wealth, and power. They are  
not inherently evil nor are they “un-spiritual.”  
Express your overflow of joy and beauty with fine robes, wine,  
headdresses, or whatever you will.  
Feel no regret, guilt, or shame in your reckless expression of being  
Drunk with the Glory of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!  
“Be goodly therefore: dress ye all in fine apparel; eat rich foods  
and drink sweet wines and wines that foam! Also, take your fill and  
will of love as ye will, when, where and with whom ye will! But  
always unto me… Ye shall gather goods and store of women and  
spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of the  
earth in splendour & pride; but always in the love of me, and so  
shall ye come to my joy… Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of  
sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.”  
– Liber AL, I:51, 61; II:22

29

Every man, woman, and child who consciously accepts the word of  
the Law, “Do what thou wilt,” is certainly a warrior in the Army of Ra-Hoor-Khuit. Simply by existing and enacting the Law of Thelema in every  
circumstance, the stars of Force & Fire (each one of you) will spread the  
Law by their own example.  
We must see the sublime beauty in Thelema’s answers to the  
conundrums of ethics, reasons, and metaphysics. Therefore must we  
constantly study the Holy Books of Thelema, especially Liber AL vel  
Legis, the Book of the Law.  
The most important thing is to exude your overflow of strength,  
beauty, force and fire in a natural way. Do what thou wilt and let all  
around you see the joy you have in doing so!  
“The excellence of the Law must be showed by its results upon  
those who accept it. When men see us as the hermits of Hadit

30

described in [The Book of the Law], they will determine to  
emulate our joy.” – Khabs am Pekht

30

One must make Thelema the center of one’s life, the locus of all  
meaning and motion. We may remind ourselves through rituals and feasts  
of all sorts.  
But a truly effective Warrior of Life & Light must be strong and  
healthy in both mind and body.  
“Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not  
animal; refine thy rapture!” – Liber AL, II:70  
Every warrior of Ra-Hoor-Khuit needs to exert themselves  
physically and mentally. We have no room for arm-chair dwellers who  
manipulate intellectual facts endlessly. Therefore every person should  
regularly exercise their bodies.  
“Establish at thy Kaaba a clerk-house; all must be done well and  
with business way.’” – Liber AL, III:41  
Your Kaaba, your starry heart and essence of consciousness, must  
be established within a mind of great power and conciseness, arranged  
like a business with orderliness and detachment. Therefore practice  
meditation to make the mind a perfect instrument of the Will: perfect the  
skills of concentration and non-attachment.  
Exercise your body and your mind with diligence but always strive  
unto higher goals and ideals. Never tire of competition and exceeding  
your own perceived limits.  
“But exceed! exceed! Strive ever to more!” – Liber AL, II:71-72

30

Every person must be a pyramid: flawless from base to apex,  
sufficient unto themselves. Yet each Star is part of the Body of Infinite  
22Space. Therefore make friends and enemies as ye will.  
Our attitude to one another must be one of great respect like the  
chivalry from the West or bushido from the East. Thrill with the joy of  
vigorous competition and conflict yet always out of overflow of Will,  
strength, beauty, love, and rapture.  
Therefore do not cover yourself to mask your true brilliance. Let  
the Sun of your Will shine effulgently on all things: care not that it will  
inevitably nourish some and destroy others.  
But also do not fear losing your supposed “freedom” by banding  
together with other stars. Verily, a galaxy is an inconceivably potent  
source of gravitational force although it is, in reality, made up of individual  
stars…  
Therefore make camps and lodges and groups and propagate the  
Spirit of Freedom, enshrined in the Word of the Law: Thelema.  
“But the keen and the proud, the royal and the lofty; ye are  
brothers! As brothers fight ye!” – Liber AL, III:58-59
