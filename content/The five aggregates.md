## The five aggregates  #‚è≥ 

The five aggragates are a scheme for analyzing the human sense of identity and for explicating the structure of living experience. These include:

- [[form]]
- [[feeling]]
- [[perception]]
- [[volitional formation]]s
- [[consciousness]]

The five aggregates are said to be the objective domain of [[clinging]]. We cling to the aggregates in two principle ways, which we may call appropriation and identification. Appropriation involves grasping the aggregates with desire and assuming possession of them. Identification involves using the aggregates as the basis for views about what ones real self is or for conceit (I am better than, good as, inferior to others. I. e. I am good looking, i am ugly, etc.). We are prone to think of the five aggregates thus: "this is mine, this i am, this is myself." The notion "this is mine" represents an act of appropriation, which is a function of [[craving]]. The notions "this i am" and "this is myself" represent two types of identification: the former expressing conceit, the latter expressing views.

The five aggregates are the ultimate adherent to the first [[The four nobel truths|nobel truth]]: the truth of dissatisfaction. and since [[the four nobel truths]] revolve around dissatisfaction, understanding the five aggregates is critical to understanding [[the four nobel truths]] as a whole. Second, the five aggregates are the objective domain of [[clinging]] and as such contribute to the causal origination of future dissatisfaction. Third, [[clinging]] to the five aggregates must be removed in order to realize [[Nibbana]]. And fourth, the kind of wisdom needed to remove [[clinging]] to the aggregates is [[insight]] into the [[the three characteristics]].
