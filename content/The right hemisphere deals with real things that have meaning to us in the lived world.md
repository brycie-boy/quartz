## The right hemisphere deals with real things that have meaning to us in the lived world # 

The [[right hemisphere]] prioritizes whatever actually is, and what concerns us. It prefers existing things, real scenes and stimuli that can be made sense of in terms of the lived world, whatever it is that has meaning and value for us as human beings. It is more able to assimilate information from the environment, without automatically responding to it, and, possibly as a result, the developing [[right hemisphere]] is more sensitive to environmental influences.
