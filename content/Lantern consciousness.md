## Lantern consciousness

Lantern [consciousness](Consciousness.md) is a [high-entropy state](High-entropy%20state.md) that occurs when attention is more widely diffused, allowing one to take in information from virtually anywhere in their field of awareness. It is dependent on the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) because [the right hemisphere has broad, global attention, while the left has narrow attention](The%20right%20hemisphere%20has%20broad,%20global%20attention,%20while%20the%20left%20has%20narrow%20attention.md). This is the default state that is experienced by children, as [babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left](Babies%20and%20children%20are%20more%20reliant%20on%20the%20right%20hemisphere%20than%20the%20left.md). While children seldom exhibit sustained periods of [spotlight consciousness](Spotlight%20consciousness.md), adults occasionally experience that ‚Äúvivid panoramic illumination of the everyday‚Äù that lantern [consciousness](Consciousness.md) affords us.

[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects](The%20left%20hemisphere%20prioritizes%20things%20that%20it%20already%20knows%20and%20expects.md), and being inexperienced in the way of the world, the mind of the young child has comparatively few priors and preconceptions from which the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) can guide their perceptions down the predictable tracks. Instead, the child approaches reality with the astonishment of an adult on [psychedelic](Psychedelic.md)s. This may also be the reason why [children, babies, and animals act independently without caring what others will think](Children,%20babies,%20and%20animals%20act%20independently%20without%20caring%20what%20others%20will%20think.md).
