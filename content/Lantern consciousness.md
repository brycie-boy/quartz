## Lantern consciousness  #🧠 

Lantern consciousness occurs when attention is more widely diffused, allowing one to take in information from virtually anywhere in their field of awareness. It is dependent on the [[right hemisphere]] because the right hemisphere has broad and global attention ([[The right hemisphere has broad, global, and flexible attention, while the left has narrow attention]]). This is the default state that is experienced by children, as [[babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left]].

[[The left hemisphere prioritizes things that it already knows and expects]], and being inexperienced in the way of the world, the mind of the young child has comparatively few priors and preconceptions from which the [[left hemisphere]] can guide their perceptions down the predictable tracks. Instead, the child approaches reality with the astonishment of an adult on [[psychedelic]]s.
