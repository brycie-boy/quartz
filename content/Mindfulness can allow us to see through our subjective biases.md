## Mindfulness can allow us to see through our subjective biases  # 

[[We ordinarily perceive reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments]]. If we get lost because our [[subjective bias]]es keep us running around in circles, [[mindfulness]] brings awareness to _these very biases_ so that we can see how we are leading our selves astray and [[We can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives]]. Once we see that we are not going anywhere, we can stop, drop the unecessary baggage, and reorient ourselves. Metaphorically, [[mindfulness]] becomes the map that helps us navigate lifes terrain.
