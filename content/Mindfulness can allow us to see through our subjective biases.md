## Mindfulness can allow us to see through our subjective biases

[We ordinarily perceive reality through subjective biases shaped by our craving and attachments](We%20ordinarily%20perceive%20reality%20through%20subjective%20biases%20shaped%20by%20our%20craving%20and%20attachments.md). If we get lost because our [subjective bias](Subjective%20bias.md)es keep us running around in circles, [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) brings awareness to *these very biases* so that we can see how we are leading our selves astray and [We can use our stress as a navigational tool to help guide our lives](We%20can%20use%20our%20stress%20as%20a%20navigational%20tool%20to%20help%20guide%20our%20lives.md). Once we see that we are not going anywhere, we can stop, drop the unecessary baggage, and reorient ourselves. Metaphorically, [mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) becomes the map that helps us navigate lifes terrain.
