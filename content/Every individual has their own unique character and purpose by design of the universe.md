## Every individual has their own unique character and purpose by design of the universe #🧠 

Every person is intrinsically an independent individual with their own proper character and proper motion or role by design of the Universe. As The Book of the Law puts it, "Every man and every woman is a star," meaning everyone has their own course, there own orbit, depending partly on our innermost self, and partly on the outer world.
