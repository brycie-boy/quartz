## To be self-reliant and innovative requires not conforming to social norms

We generally maintain the ability to entertain our personal intuitions while in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against individuality. It is like a joint-stock company in which the price of investment is to surrender our independence. The virtue in most request is [conformity](Conformity.md). For example, [public schools serve to manufacture a manageable population and to put down dissent and originality](Public%20schools%20serve%20to%20manufacture%20a%20manageable%20population%20and%20to%20put%20down%20dissent%20and%20originality.md). [Self-reliance](Self-reliance.md) is [conformity](Conformity.md)s aversion. [Conformity](Conformity.md) loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. To be [self-reliant](Self-reliance.md) is to be a nonconformist.

An innovative person must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore for themselves if it is goodness.[Values can only be considered truly valid until one witnesses their value for themselves](Values%20can%20only%20be%20considered%20truly%20valid%20until%20one%20witnesses%20their%20value%20for%20themselves.md). No law shall be sacred to them but that of their own nature. Good and bad are just names readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after their constitution, the only wrong what is against it. A [self-reliant](Self-reliance.md) individual is to carry themselves in the presence of all opposition.
