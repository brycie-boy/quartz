## To be self-reliant and innovative requires not conforming to social norms #üß† 

We generally maintain the ability to entertain our personal thoughts and desires while in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against individuality. It is like a joint-stock company in which the price of investment is to surrender our independence. The virtue in most request is [[conformity]]. [[Self-reliance]] is [[conformity]]s aversion. To be [[Self-reliance|self-reliant]] is to be a nonconformist.

The [[Self-reliance|self-reliant]] individual must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore for themselves if it really is goodness. No law is sacred to them but their [[True Will]]. Good and bad are just names readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after their own constitution, the only wrong what is against it. A [[Self-reliance|self-reliant]] individual is to carry themselves in the presence of all opposition.
