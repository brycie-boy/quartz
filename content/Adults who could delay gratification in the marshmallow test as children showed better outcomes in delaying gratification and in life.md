## Adults who could delay gratification in the marshmallow test as children showed better outcomes in delaying gratification and in life

[Preschoolers who previously delayed gratification in the marshmallow test showed better outcomes in delaying gratification and in life](Preschoolers%20who%20previously%20delayed%20gratification%20in%20the%20marshmallow%20test%20showed%20better%20outcomes%20in%20delaying%20gratification%20and%20in%20life.md). Around age twenty-five to thirty, those who had [delayed gratification](Delayed%20gratification.md) longer in [the Marshmallow Test](The%20Marshmallow%20Test.md) self-reported that they were more able to pursue and reach long-term goals, used risky drugs less, had reached higher educational levels, and had a significantly lower body mass index. They were also more resilient and adaptive in coping with interpersonal problems and better at maintaining close relationships.
