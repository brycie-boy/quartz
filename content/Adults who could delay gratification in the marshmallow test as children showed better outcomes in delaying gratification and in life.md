##  Adults who could delay gratification in the marshmallow test as children showed better outcomes in delaying gratification and in life # 

[[Preschoolers who previously delayed gratification in the marshmallow test showed better outcomes in delaying gratification and in life]]. Around age twenty-five to thirty, those who had [[delayed gratification]] longer in [[the Marshmallow Test]] self-reported that they were more able to pursue and reach long-term goals, used risky drugs less, had reached higher educational levels, and had a significantly lower body mass index. They were also more resilient and adaptive in coping with interpersonal problems and better at maintaining close relationships.
