## It has been shown that new neurons are able to be created in the brain

For the better part of the twentieth century, scientific dogma held that the [brain](Brain.md) was hardwired once fully developed in adolescence, meaning we’re born with all the neurons we’re going to get. We can rearrange [synapse](Synapse.md)s all we like, but we can only lose [neuron](Neuron.md)s.

But guess what? They do grow back — by the thousands. Not until scientists became handy with advanced imaging tools that enabled them to peer into the [brain](Brain.md) did they find conclusive evidence, which was published in a seminal 1998 paper. It came from an unlikely source. [Cancer]() patients are sometimes injected with a dye that shows up in proliferating [cell]()s so that the spread of the disease can be tracked. Researchers looked at the [brain](Brain.md)s of terminally ill patients who had donated their bodies to science and found that their [hippocampi](Hippocampus.md) were packed with the dye marker, proof that [neuron](Neuron.md)s were dividing and propagating — a process called [neurogenesis](Neurogenesis.md) — just like cells in the rest of the body.
