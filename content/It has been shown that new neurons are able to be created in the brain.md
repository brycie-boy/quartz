## It has been shown that new neurons are able to be created in the brain # 

For the better part of the twentieth century, scientific dogma held that the [[brain]] was hardwired once fully developed in adolescence, meaning we’re born with all the neurons we’re going to get. We can rearrange [[synapse]]s all we like, but we can only lose [[neuron]]s.

But guess what? They do grow back — by the thousands. Not until scientists became handy with advanced imaging tools that enabled them to peer into the [[brain]] did they find conclusive evidence, which was published in a seminal 1998 paper. It came from an unlikely source. [[Cancer]] patients are sometimes injected with a dye that shows up in proliferating [[cell]]s so that the spread of the disease can be tracked. Researchers looked at the [[brain]]s of terminally ill patients who had donated their bodies to science and found that their [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]] were packed with the dye marker, proof that [[neuron]]s were dividing and propagating — a process called [[neurogenesis]] — just like cells in the rest of the body.
