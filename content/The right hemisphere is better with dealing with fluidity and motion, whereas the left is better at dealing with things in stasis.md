## The right hemisphere is better with dealing with fluidity and motion, whereas the left is better at dealing with things in stasis

It has been suggested that, whereas the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) is required for the sustained ‚Äòmonitoring of temporal information‚Äô ([the right hemisphere is responsible for our sense of time as continuous and unified](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20responsible%20for%20our%20sense%20of%20time%20as%20continuous%20and%20unified.md)), the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is more efficient for detection of brief temporal flow interruptions that are decontextualised. I believe this merely confirms the predilection for abstraction ([the left hemisphere tends to understand things as logical, abstract, and stripped of context](The%20left%20hemisphere%20tends%20to%20understand%20things%20as%20logical,%20abstract,%20and%20stripped%20of%20context.md)), as well as the lack of capacity for perception of temporal flow ([the left hemisphere perceives time as a sequential series of fragmented individual moments](The%20left%20hemisphere%20perceives%20time%20as%20a%20sequential%20series%20of%20fragmented%20individual%20moments.md)), in the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md). The critical point here is that the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) has an advantage where there is fluency of motion, or flow over time, but the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) an advantage where there is stasis, or focus on a point in time. 

There is also an ambiguity in the idea of permanence. The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) seems to accept the permanence of something only if it is static. But things can change‚Äîflow‚Äîand yet have permanence: think of a river. [The right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20able%20to%20integrate%20individual%20aspects%20of%20things%20into%20a%20coherent%20whole%20whereas%20the%20left%20sees%20only%20separate%20entities.md), so the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) perceives that there is permanence even where there is flow. Hence, when it is damaged, living beings have no permanency‚Äîthe Capgras phenomenon.
