## Pure Reason #üß†

Pure Reason is a philosophical view originating from the Greeks which argues that, even if sense data is fallible ([Because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential](Because%20perception%20is%20not%20absolute,%20all%20of%20our%20ideas%20are%20somewhat%20conjectural%20and%20inferential.md)), there still exists a higher faculty which is not fallible and knows truths a priori.
