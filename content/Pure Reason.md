## Pure Reason #🧠 

Pure Reason is a philosophical view originating from the Greeks which argues that, even if sense data is fallible ([[Because perception is not absolute, all of our ideas are somewhat conjectural and inferential]]), there still exists a higher faculty which is not fallible and knows truths a priori.
