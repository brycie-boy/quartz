## Pure Reason  #‚è≥

Pure Reason is a philosophical view originating from the Greeks which argues that, even if sense data is fallible because [the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously interpret and edit their input](The%20brain's%20perceptual%20systems%20actively%20and%20pre-consciously%20interpret%20and%20edit%20their%20input.md), there still exists a higher faculty which is not fallible and knows truths a priori.
