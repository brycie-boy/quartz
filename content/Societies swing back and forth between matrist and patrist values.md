## Societies swing back and forth between matrist and patrist values

has been proposed, by sociologist G. Rattray Taylor that societies swing back and forth between “[Matrist]()” periods, in which motherly oral values predominate and “[Patrist]()” periods, in which fatherly anal values are in ascendance. Taylor’s table of the characteristics of these “Matrist” and “Patrist” periods is as follows:

Whether or not societies wobble between these extremes as Taylor claims, individuals certainly do. These are merely the consequences of (a) having the heaviest [imprint](Imprint.md) on the oral (Matrist) [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) or (b) having the heaviest [imprint](Imprint.md) on the anal (Patrist) [Emotional-Territorial Circuit](Emotional-Territorial%20Circuit.md).
