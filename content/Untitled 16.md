## Heading  # 

- [[We only rush to certitude when time pressure or prejudice is involved]]

In daily life and in "common sense" we maintain this degree of [[Model Agnosticism]] and "expect the unexpected" and "keep our eyes and ears open," etc. We only rush to conclusions when we are under time pressure to make a quick decision or when prejudices are involved, as in religous or political controversy. When there is no existensial pressure for quick decisions, only prejudice asserts certitude.
