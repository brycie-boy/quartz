## Heading

* [We only rush to certitude when time pressure or prejudice is involved](We%20only%20rush%20to%20certitude%20when%20time%20pressure%20or%20prejudice%20is%20involved.md)

In daily life and in "common sense" we maintain this degree of [Model Agnosticism](Model%20Agnosticism.md) and "expect the unexpected" and "keep our eyes and ears open," etc. We only rush to conclusions when we are under time pressure to make a quick decision or when prejudices are involved, as in religous or political controversy. When there is no existensial pressure for quick decisions, only prejudice asserts certitude.
