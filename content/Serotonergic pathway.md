The serotonergic pathway is a part of the [limbic system](Limbic%20system.md) and involves an area in the [midbrain]() called the [dorsal raphe nucleus]() which contains [neuron](Neuron.md)s that produce the [neurotransmitter](Neurotransmitter.md) [serotonin](Serotonin.md) which fans out to distant sites all over the [cerebral cortex](). [Serotonin](Serotonin.md) acts in different ways on different [neuron](Neuron.md)s, depending on each [neuron](Neuron.md)‚Äôs function and the type of [receptor](Receptor.md) that sits on its surface.
