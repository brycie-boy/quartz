## Preschoolers who previously delayed gratification in the marshmallow test showed better outcomes in delaying gratification and in life # 

In the first follow-up for [[the Marshmallow Test]], the researchers mailed small bundles of questionnaires to their parents and asked them to “think about your child in comparison to his or her peers, such as classmates and other same-age friends. We would like to get your impression of how your son or daughter compares to those peers.” They were to rate their children on a scale of 1 to 9 (from “Not at all” to “Moderately” to “Extremely”). We also obtained similar ratings from their teachers about the children’s cognitive and social skills at school.

Preschoolers who [[delayed gratification]] longer on [[the Marshmallow Test]] were rated a dozen years later as adolescents who exhibited better [[executive function]]. They had better self-control in frustrating situations; yielded less to temptation; were less distractible when trying to concentrate; were more intelligent, self-reliant, and confident; and trusted their own judgment. When under stress they did not fold as much as the low delayers did, and they were less likely to become rattled and disorganized or revert to immature behavior. Likewise, they thought ahead and planned more, and when motivated they were more able to pursue their goals. They were also more attentive and able to use and respond to reason, and they were less likely to be sidetracked by setbacks.
