## The contemplation the senses and the sensations that arise them from through the three characteristics can lead to nibbana #‚è≥ 

In one of his earliest discources popularly known as "The Fire Sermon", [[The Buddha]] declared that "all is burning". The "all" is the internal [[six sense bases]], their corresponding objects, the types of [[consciousness]] arisen from them, the related [[sense impression]]s, and the following [[feeling]]s arisen from them. The way to [[Nibbana]] is to see that this "all" is burning with [[craving]] and dissatisfaction. To dispell [[ignorance]] and generate true knowledge, we must contemplate the senses and the [[feeling]]s that arise them from through [[the three characteristics]]. This, according to [[The Nikayas]], is the direct way to the realization of [[Nibbana]].
