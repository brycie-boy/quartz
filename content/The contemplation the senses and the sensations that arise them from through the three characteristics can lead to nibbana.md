## The contemplation the senses and the sensations that arise them from through the three characteristics can lead to nibbana #‚è≥

In one of his earliest discources popularly known as "The Fire Sermon", [The Buddha]() declared that "all is burning". The "all" is the internal [six sense bases](Six%20sense%20bases.md), their corresponding objects, the types of [consciousness](Consciousness.md) arisen from them, the related [sense impression](Sense%20impression.md)s, and the following [feeling](Feeling.md)s arisen from them. The way to [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) is to see that this "all" is burning with [craving](Craving.md) and dissatisfaction. To dispell [ignorance](Ignorance.md) and generate true knowledge, we must contemplate the senses and the [feeling](Feeling.md)s that arise them from through [the three characteristics](The%20three%20characteristics.md). This, according to [The Nikayas](), is the direct way to the realization of [Nibbana](Nibbana.md).
