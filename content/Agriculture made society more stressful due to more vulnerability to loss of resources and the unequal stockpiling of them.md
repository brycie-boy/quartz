## Agriculture made society more stressful due to more vulnerability to loss of resources and the unequal stockpiling of them

[Unlike monkey's, humans who rank low in the hierarchy almost always have a disproportionate share of disease](Unlike%20monkey's,%20humans%20who%20rank%20low%20in%20the%20hierarchy%20almost%20always%20have%20a%20disproportionate%20share%20of%20disease.md). What does this dichotomy between our animal cousins and us signify? The primate relationship is nuanced and filled with qualifiers; the human relationship is a sledgehammer that obliterates every societal difference. Are we humans actually less complicated and sophisticated than nonhuman primates? Not even the most chauvinistic primatologists holding out for their beasts would vote for that conclusion. I think it suggests something else. 

Agriculture is a fairly recent human invention, and in many ways it was one of the great stupid moves of all time. Hunter-gatherers have thousands of wild sources of food to subsist on. Agriculture changed all that, generating an overwhelming reliance on a few dozen domesticated food sources, making you extremely vulnerable to the next famine, the next locust infestation, the next potato blight, etc. Agriculture also allowed for the stockpiling of surplus resources and thus, inevitably, the unequal stockpiling of them‚Äîstratification of society and the invention of classes. Thus, it allowed for the invention of poverty. I think that the punch line of the primate-human difference is that when humans invented poverty, they came up with a way of subjugating the low-ranking like nothing ever before seen in the primate world.
