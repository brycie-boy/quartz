## The capacity for psychedelics to break habitual thought patterns may help adults be able to entertain new ideas # 

- Children are more willing to entertain new ideas

[[Babies and children are more reliant on the right hemisphere than the left]]. As we get older, the [[left hemisphere]] and the [[default mode network]] develop and [[consciousness]] narrows. Adults have congealed in their beliefs and are hard to shift, whereas [[the right frontal lobes allow for flexibility in thought and behavior]] and children are more fluid and consequently more willing to entertain new ideas. As [[Lao Tzu]] describes: "A newborn is soft and tender,  [and] a crone, hard and stiff. Plants and animals, in life, are supple and succulent; In death, withered and dry.  So softness and tenderness are attributes of life, and hardness and stiffness, attributes of death."

For the mentally well, [[psychedelic]]s, by introducing more noise or entropy into the [[brain]], might shake people out of their habitual patterns of thought—“lubricate cognition,” in Dr. [[Robin Carhart-Harris]]’s words—in ways that might enhance well-being, make us more open and boost creativity.
