## Since the Monad reconciles all contraries, we can realize it through the fulfillment of all possibilities # 

[[An error in our Magick creates conflict with our own nature since change is not occurring in conformity with our True Will]]. Indeed, it may seem to some of us to overshoot the mark; for nothing is permissible in that scheme but frictionless adjustment and adaptation to circumstance. Enlightenment in other traditions involves in the absence of any sort of disturbance in consciousness. Those who want to realize the [[Monad]], ideally perfect as it is in itself, can also realize it in the fulfillment of all possibilities. All such phenomena or "point-events" are equally "illusion"—[[emptiness]] is always [[emptiness]]—but the projection of [[emptiness]] on this screen of phenomenal experience does not only explain, but constitutes, the Universe. It is the only system which reconciles all the contradictions inherent in thought, and in experience, since it is constituted by [[Dependent Origination]]. In it "Reality" _is_ "Illusion"; "Free-will" _is_ "Destiny"; the "Self' _is_ the "Not-Self'; and so for every puzzle of Philosophy.

A decent analogy for this is an endless piece of string. You cannot tie a knot in it; all the complexities you can contrive are false knots, and unravel at the proper touch. It is always either Nothing or Two. But every new re-arrangement throws further light on the possible tangles, that is, on the Nature of the String itself. It is always Nothing when you pull it out; but becomes "Everything" as you play about with it, since there is no limit to the combinations that you can form from it, save only in your imagination and that grows mightily with Experience. It is accordingly well worth while to fulfill oneself in every conceivable manner.
