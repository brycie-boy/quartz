## Exposure therapy # 

[[We must expose ourselves to trauma in order to overcome our aversion toward it]]. in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], a treatment method called exposure therapy does just this. It is a type of treatment for trauma in which patients are exposed to the things they find upsetting (at first in small ways, such as imagining them or looking at pictures), activating their fear, and helping them [[habituation|habituate]] to the stimuli.
