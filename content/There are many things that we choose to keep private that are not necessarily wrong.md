## There are many things that we choose to keep private that are not necessarily wrong  #üß†

The most common misconception about privacy is that its about having something to hide: "If you're not doing anything wrong, then you have nothing to hide," the saying goes, with the obvious implication that privacy only aids wrongdoers. If you think about it though, this makes no sense. We do nothing paticularly wrong when we have sex, go to the bathroom, or sing in the shower. We do nothing wrong when we search for a new job without telling our current employer. We do nothing wrong when we seek out private places for reflection or conversation, when we choose not to talk about something emotional or personal, or when we confide with a freind and no one else. And we do nothing wrong when we hide our bank info, legal documents, etc.
