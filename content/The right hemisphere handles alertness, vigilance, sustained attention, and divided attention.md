## The right hemisphere handles alertness, vigilance, sustained attention, and divided attention

Vigilance and sustained attention are grossly impaired in subjects with [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) lesions, especially right [frontal lobe](Frontal%20lobe.md) lesions; by contrast, in patients with [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md)lesions (therefore relying on their intact [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)) vigilance is preserved. Patients with [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) lesions also exhibit what is called perceptuomotor slowing, a sign of diminished alertness, associated with lapses of attention. Studies in both healthy subjects and split-brain patients corroborate the role of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) in the ‘intensity’ aspects of attention; and scanning studies provide further confirmatory evidence of [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) dominance in alertness and sustained attention. Overall it appears clear that intensity (alertness, vigilance and sustained attention) is reliant on the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md). While some studies suggest that both left and [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md)s are involved, there appears to be a clear primary role for the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), especially the right [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex](Dorsolateral%20prefrontal%20cortex.md).
