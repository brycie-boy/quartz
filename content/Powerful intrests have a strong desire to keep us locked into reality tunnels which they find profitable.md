## Powerful intrests have a strong desire to keep us locked into reality tunnels which they find profitable

[Many doctrines expound ideas which require a degree of trust and insist upon our faith in them](Many%20doctrines%20expound%20ideas%20which%20require%20a%20degree%20of%20trust%20and%20insist%20upon%20our%20faith%20in%20them.md). Powerful churches, political parties, and vested intrests have a strong desire to program the rest of us into the paticular [reality tunnel](Reality%20tunnel.md)s which they find profitable, and to keep us from becoming self-programmers. They want to *take responsibility* for us, and they have no wish to see us take responsibility for ourselves. Materialism-in-the-philosophical-sense is very much supported by materialism-in-the-economic-sense.
