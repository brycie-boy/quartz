## Powerful intrests have a strong desire to keep us locked into reality tunnels which they find profitable  # 

[[Many doctrines expound ideas which require a degree of trust and insist upon our faith in them]]. Powerful churches, political parties, and vested intrests have a strong desire to program the rest of us into the paticular [[reality tunnel]]s which they find profitable, and to keep us from becoming self-programmers. They want to _take responsibility_ for us, and they have no wish to see us take responsibility for ourselves. Materialism-in-the-philosophical-sense is very much supported by materialism-in-the-economic-sense.
