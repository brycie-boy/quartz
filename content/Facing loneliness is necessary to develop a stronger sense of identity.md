## Facing loneliness is necessary to develop a stronger sense of identity

The true antidote to the fact that [people with a weak sense of identity lack a foundation to structure and direct their lives](People%20with%20a%20weak%20sense%20of%20identity%20lack%20a%20foundation%20to%20structure%20and%20direct%20their%20lives.md) is to discover what we truly want with our life and to take the actions necessary to bring that identity, and life, into existence. To accomplish this, we must be willing to face up to our loneliness and the anxiety which accompanies it, for loneliness, as [Edward Edinger]() put it, is ‚Äúa precursor to the positive experience of aloneness.‚Äù And it is in periods of aloneness that we can begin to learn who we are and what we want with our life.
