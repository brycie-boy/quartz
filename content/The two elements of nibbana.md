## The two elements of nibbana  #⏳

[The Nikayas]() often speak of two "elements of [Nibbana](Nibbana.md)," the [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) element with residue remaining and the [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) element without residue remaining. The [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) element with residue remaining is described as the destruction of [the three unwholesome roots](The%20three%20unwholesome%20roots.md) while the [Arahant](Arahant.md) is still alive. the "residue" is the composite of [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md) that was brought into being by the ignorance and craving from the previous life and that must continue on until the end of the lifespan. As for the [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) element without residue remaining, it is described as the passing away of the [Arahant](Arahant.md) in which afterwords all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right there. Since there is no more clinging to [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md) and no more craving for a new existence with a fresh set of aggregates, the occurance of the aggregates comes to an end and cannot continue, the process of the aggregates is extinguished (the literal meaning of [Nibbana](Nibbana.md)).

[The Buddha](), however, says nothing at all in terms of exitstence or nonexistence, the condition of the [Arahant](Arahant.md) after death. It might seem logical that [The five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md) completely cease with the attainment of the [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) element without residue. The element itself must be a state of complete nonexistence, a state of nothingness. Yet no text within [The Nikayas]() ever states this. To the contrary, they often refer to [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) in terms of actualities. It is an element, a base, a reality, a state, and so on. However,  it is qualified in ways that indicate this state ultimately lies beyond all familiar categories and concepts. In a discourse within [The Nikayas](), the wanderer Vacchagotta asks [The Buddha]() whether the [Tathāgata]() is reborn or not after death. [The Buddha]() refuses to concede any of the four alternatives. To say that the [Tathāgata]() is reborn, is not reborn, both is and is not reborn, and neither is nor is not reborn—none of these is acceptable, for all accept the term [Tathāgata]() as indicative of a real being, while from an internal point of view a [Tathāgata]() has given up all [clinging](Clinging.md) to notions of a real being. [The Buddha]() illustrates this point with the simile of an extinguished fire. Just as a fire that has been extinguished cannot be said to have gone anywhere but must simply be said to have “gone out,” so too with the breakup of the body the [Tathāgata]() does not go anywhere but has simply “gone out.” However, if this simile is interpreted as a Buddhist version of [annihilationism](Annihilationism.md), then this impression would rest on a misunderstanding of the [Arahant](Arahant.md) as a "self" or "person" that is annihilated (see [identity view](Identity%20view.md)). Our problem with understanding the state of the [Tathāgata]() after death is compounded by our difficulty understanding the state of the [Tathāgata]() while alive. [The Buddha]()s simile of the great ocean underscores this difficulty. Since the [Tathāgata]() no longer identifies with [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md) that constitute individual identity, he cannot be reckoned in terms of them, individually or collectively. Freed from reckoning in terms of [the five aggregates](The%20five%20aggregates.md), the [Tathāgata]() transcends our understanding. Like a vast ocean, he is "deep, immesurable, and hard to fathom".
