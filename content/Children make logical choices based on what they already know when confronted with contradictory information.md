## Children make logical choices based on what they already know when confronted with contradictory information

[The cognitive approach to learning overlooks the role of environment in a students capacity to learn something](The%20cognitive%20approach%20to%20learning%20overlooks%20the%20role%20of%20environment%20in%20a%20students%20capacity%20to%20learn%20something.md). Luckily, not all cognitive scientists focus on pigeons and memorizing lists. Some observe children learning with wonder at their capabilities and capacity for reflection. One of these is [Alison Gopnik](), an American developmental psychologist and philosopher. Rather than trying to teach children information and testing them on their retention, [Gopnik]() designs experiments to show what young children already know, and how this knowledge interacts with their experiences.

For example, it turns out that, faced with two adults giving them contradictory information, children as young as three or four make logical choices about who to believe. They tend to believe their parent over a stranger, but they also take account of how confidently things are said. They‚Äôre more likely to believe someone who expresses their ideas with conviction than someone who sounds tentative.
