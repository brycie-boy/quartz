## Contemplation of mind

Contemplation of mind is one of [The establishments of mindfulness](The%20establishments%20of%20mindfulness.md). It is described by [the Buddha]() as follows:

 > 
 > “And how ... does a monk dwell contemplating ... \[the\] mind? Here a monk understands a mind with desire as a mind with desire, and a mind without desire as a mind without desire. He understands a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He understands a mind with [Ignorance](Ignorance.md) as a mind with [Ignorance](Ignorance.md), and a mind without [Ignorance](Ignorance.md) as a mind without [Ignorance](Ignorance.md). He understands a contracted mind as contracted, and a distracted mind as distracted. He understands an exalted mind as exalted, and an unexalted mind as unexalted. He understands a surpassable mind as surpassable, and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable. He understands a concentrated mind as concentrated, and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated. He understands a liberated mind as liberated, and an unliberated mind as unliberated.
