## Contemplation of mind  #

Contemplation of mind is one of [[The establishments of mindfulness]]. It is described by [[the Buddha]] as follows:

> “And how ... does a monk dwell contemplating ... [the] mind? Here a monk understands a mind with desire as a mind with desire, and a mind without desire as a mind without desire. He understands a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He understands a mind with [[Ignorance]] as a mind with [[Ignorance]], and a mind without [[Ignorance]] as a mind without [[Ignorance]]. He understands a contracted mind as contracted, and a distracted mind as distracted. He understands an exalted mind as exalted, and an unexalted mind as unexalted. He understands a surpassable mind as surpassable, and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable. He understands a concentrated mind as concentrated, and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated. He understands a liberated mind as liberated, and an unliberated mind as unliberated.
