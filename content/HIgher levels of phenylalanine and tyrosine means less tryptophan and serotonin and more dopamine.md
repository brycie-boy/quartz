## HIgher levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine means less tryptophan and serotonin and more dopamine

[Tryptophan]() is only one type of [amino acid]() that needs to make it into the brain. These building blocks hop on [amino acid transporter]()s to cross over the [blood-brain barrier](). The problem is, the transporters are sometimes difficult to come by. [Tryptophan]() is in competition with at least two other [amino acid]()s, [phenylalanine]() and [tyrosine](), which are the building blocks for [dopamine](Dopamine.md). The more building blocks for [dopamine](Dopamine.md). the fewer that are available for [tryptophan]() to head to the brain and thus less contentment for the evening. This competitive mechanism of [tryptophan]() transport into the [brain](Brain.md) is but one way by which reward trumps contentment.
