## Heading # 

[[Slave morality]] says No to what is outside and is different to itself, and this No is its creative deed. Its inversion of [[master morality]] and its need to direct one’s view outward instead of back to themselves is of the essence of [[resentment]]. in order to exist, slave morality always first needs a hostile external world. There every action is but a reaction.
