## Heading

[Slave morality](Slave%20Morality.md) says No to what is outside and is different to itself, and this No is its creative deed. Its inversion of [master morality](Master%20morality.md) and its need to direct one’s view outward instead of back to themselves is of the essence of [resentment](Resentment.md). in order to exist, slave morality always first needs a hostile external world. There every action is but a reaction.
