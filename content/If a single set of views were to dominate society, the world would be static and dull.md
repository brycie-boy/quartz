## If a single set of views were to dominate society, the world would be static and dull

[Nothing can be fully understood without its opposite](Nothing%20can%20be%20fully%20understood%20without%20its%20opposite.md), but arguments, division and tribalism are, of course, a source of discomfort and confusion. It is thus unsurprising that most people choose a side and want to see that side triumph. They long to enjoy the outbreak of peace that would‚Äîsupposedly‚Äîarrive after their chosen enemies had been wiped away. But a scenario like this would result in a static, unchanging world devoid of joy or surprise. [Humanities greatest innovators are ones who defied social norms and followed their own intuitions](Humanities%20greatest%20innovators%20are%20ones%20who%20defied%20social%20norms%20and%20followed%20their%20own%20intuitions.md). Without the momentum fueled by the clashing of perspectives, the universe would ground to a halt and die. Also, [society will have no chance of progress if surveillance prevents us from deviating from the societies current beliefs and values](Society%20will%20have%20no%20chance%20of%20progress%20if%20surveillance%20prevents%20us%20from%20deviating%20from%20the%20societies%20current%20beliefs%20and%20values.md).
