## If a single set of views were to dominate society, the world would be static and dull # 

[[Nothing can be fully understood without its opposite]]. However, [[the left hemisphere sees things abstracted, isolated, and stripped of context]]. Therefor it tends to choose a single side will want to see that side triumph. It longs to enjoy the outbreak of peace that would‚Äîsupposedly‚Äîarrive after its opponents are wiped away completely. But a scenario like this would result in a static, unchanging world devoid of progress. Without the momentum fueled by the clashing of such perspectives, society would ground to a halt and die. Thus, [[you should listen to your own judgement rather than to groupthink or authority bias]].
