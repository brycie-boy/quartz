## Precuneus  # 

![[Pasted image 20230312171007.png|250]]

The precuneus is a [[brain]] structure deeply connected both with emotion—it forms part of the [[limbic system]]—and the sense of the self. It is one of the brain's most consistently ‘hot’ spots, with a high resting metabolic rate, and it goes quiet in altered states of consciousness where the sense of self is no longer active. It seems to play an important role in episodic memory, which is critical for personal identity, and in adopting the first person perspective.
