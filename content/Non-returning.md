## Non-returning

Non-returning is the third stage of [the four stages of awakening](The%20four%20stages%20of%20awakening.md). The non-returner eradicates the five "lower fetters". That is, in addition to the first three fetters eliminated by [stream-entry](Stream-entry.md), the non-returner eradicates two additional fetters, sensual lust and ill will. The non-returner is still bound by the five "higher fetters": desire for existence in [the form realm](), desire for existence in [the formless realm](), the conceit "i am", restlessness, and [ignorance](Ignorance.md). Becuase non-returners have eradicated sensual lust, they have no ties binding them to the [The sense-sphere realm](). Thus, they take birth in [The form realm](), generally in one of the five planes called the "pure abodes" exclusivley reserved for non-returners. They attain final [Nibbana](Nibbana.md) there without ever returning to the sensual realm.
