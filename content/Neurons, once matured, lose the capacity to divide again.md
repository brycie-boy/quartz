## Neurons, once matured, lose the capacity to divide again  # 

When [[cell]]s in your body die, they are usually replaced with new ones. Not so with the [[brain]], with few exceptions (like the [[hippocampus]]). Once a primitive [[brain]] [[cell]] ([[neuroblast]]) turns into a functioning [[neuron]] and starts firing, it loses the capacity to divide again.
