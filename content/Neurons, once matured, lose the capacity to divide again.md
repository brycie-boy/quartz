## Neurons, once matured, lose the capacity to divide again

When [cell]()s in your body die, they are usually replaced with new ones. Not so with the [brain](Brain.md), with few exceptions (like the [hippocampus](Hippocampus.md)). Once a primitive [brain](Brain.md) [cell]() ([neuroblast]()) turns into a functioning [neuron](Neuron.md) and starts firing, it loses the capacity to divide again.
