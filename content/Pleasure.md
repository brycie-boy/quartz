## Pleasure  #🧠

Since [our culture confaltes happiness with pleasure](Our%20culture%20confaltes%20happiness%20with%20pleasure.md), I define pleasure as the concept of gratification or reward, as derived from the French plaisir for “to please,” and neurologically it involves the [mesolimbic pathway](Mesolimbic%20pathway.md). The keys to this definition are: (1) it is immediate, (2) it provides some level of excitement or amusement, and (3) it is dependent on circumstance.
