## Pleasure  #🧠 

Since [[our culture confaltes happiness with pleasure]], I define pleasure as the concept of gratification or reward, as derived from the French plaisir for “to please,” and neurologically it involves the [[mesolimbic pathway]]. The keys to this definition are: (1) it is immediate, (2) it provides some level of excitement or amusement, and (3) it is dependent on circumstance.
