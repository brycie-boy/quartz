## A2 caseins have been shown to cause gastrointestinal inflammation

Research suggests that [A1 casein]()s may be harmful to the [gut]() in ways that [A2 casein]()s are not. In 2016, a team led by [Sun Jianqin]() studied forty-five participants who consumed milk containing both A1 and A2 milk proteins, and then milk containing only [A2 casein](). The researchers found that when subjects drank milk containing [A1 casein](), they had more gastrointestinal [inflammation](), their thinking was slower, and they made more errors on an information-processing test. 

Luckily there is milk available that only has [A2 casein](). Milk from breeds of cows that originated in Northern Europe is generally high in [A1 casein](). These breeds include Holstein, Friesian, Ayrshire, and British shorthorn. Milk that is high in [A2 casein]() is mainly found in breeds that originated in the Channel Islands and southern France. These include Guernsey, Jersey, Charolais, and Limousin cows. Sheep’s and goats’ milk is generally [A2 casein]() milk. You can also try nut milks and milk nut yogurts as a way to avoid [A2 casein]().
