## You should listen to your own judgement rather than to groupthink or authority bias #üß† 

[[Humanities greatest thinkers are those who defied groupthink and authority bias and followed their own judgement]]. People should therefor learn to be [[Self-reliance|self-reliant]] and listen closely to their own judgement, rather than to [[groupthink]] or [[authority bias]]. Unfortunately, people tend to discard their own thoughts because they belong to them. In every original work, we recognize our rejected thoughts and they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more important lesson for us than this. They teach us to avoid [[groupthink]] or [[authority bias]] and to abide by our own judgement when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Otherwise we may hear some stranger say precisely what we have thought and felt in the back of our minds, and then we‚Äôll be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.

Also, [[The right hemisphere allows for the recognition of uniqueness and familiarity, while the left only re-presents generic categories of things]]. They teach us to listen to our [[right hemisphere]] whenever it detects an anomaly, rather than to appeal to the [[left hemisphere]]s enclosed system of classification.
