## Forced material and class schedules leads students to become indifferent towards self-initiaited learning

Students do not enter public schooling on their on initiative, but are forced to study material organized by someone else. This leads students to see learning as some kind of chore or merely as being a means to achieving so-called good grades, and thus not anything one would even think about pursueing for thre own enjoyment. In school, children learn that what's called "learning" is about assuming the position of an empty receptacle into which unquestionable absolute truth is poured and that this process can be turned on and off like a light switch. When the bell rings, teachers insist they drop whatever it is we have been doing and proceed quickly to the next work station. Nothing important is ever finished in class. Indeed, the lesson of bells is that no work is worth finishing, so why care too deeply about anything? Years of bells will condition all but the strongest to a world that can no longer offer important work to do. Bells are the secret logic of school time; their logic is inexorable. Bells destroy the past and future, rendering every interval the same as any other, as the abstraction of a map renders every living mountain and river the same, even though they are not. Bells inoculate each undertaking with indifference.
