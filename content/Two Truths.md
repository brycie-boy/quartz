## Two Truths

*  For Nāgārjuna, the two truths are *epistemological truths*. The phenomenal world is accorded a provisional existence. The character of the phenomenal world is declared to be neither real nor unreal, but logically indeterminable. Ultimately, [all phenomena are empty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyata "Sunyata") (*śūnyatā*) of an inherent self or essence due to the [non-existence of the self](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81 "Anattā") (*anattā*), but exist [depending on other phenomena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da "Pratītyasamutpāda")
* The doctrine of *śūnyatā* is an attempt to show that it is neither proper nor strictly justifiable to regard any metaphysical system as absolutely valid. It doesn't lead to nihilism but strikes a middle course between excessive naivete and excessive scepticism.
* Nagarjuna's *[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C5%ABlamadhyamakak%C4%81rik%C4%81 "Mūlamadhyamakakārikā")* provides a logical defense for the claim that all things are empty ([sunyata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyata "Sunyata")) of an inherently-existing self-nature. Sunyata, however, is also shown to be "empty", and Nagarjuna's assertion of "the emptiness of emptiness" prevents sunyata from constituting a higher or ultimate reality. Nagarjuna's view is that "the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth". According to Siderits, Nagarjuna is a "semantic anti-dualist" who posits that there are only conventional truths.
* The most important philosophical contributions of the Huayan school were in the area of its metaphysics. It taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in [Indra's net](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net "Indra's net"). One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing.
