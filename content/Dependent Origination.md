## Dependent Origination

Dependent Origination is a doctrine which states that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other phenomena. As [The Buddha]() puts it: "if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist." Thus no entity or event is isolated and self-enclosed but is inherently linked to other things in a complex web of dependently originated processes. I believe this to be the perspective of the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md), since [the right hemisphere is able to integrate individual aspects of things into a coherent whole whereas the left sees only separate entities](The%20right%20hemisphere%20is%20able%20to%20integrate%20individual%20aspects%20of%20things%20into%20a%20coherent%20whole%20whereas%20the%20left%20sees%20only%20separate%20entities.md). [The Nikayas]() typically expound the doctrine of Dependent Origination through [the twelve links of Dependent Origination](The%20twelve%20links%20of%20Dependent%20Origination.md).
