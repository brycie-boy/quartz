## Posterior cingulate cortex #🧠 

The posterior cingulate cortex is the central node of the [[default mode network]] and is correlated with self-reference, thinking about others, remembering the past, planning for the future, sense of self, and [[identity view]]. It is also linked to [[clinging]] to and trying to control one’s experience, where as [[non-forcing]] is associated with decreased PCC activity. The mode of subjective experience that lined up with PCC activity is not perception of an object, but how we relate to it. In a sense, if we try to control a situation (or our lives), we have to work hard at doing something to get the results we want. In contrast, we can relax into an attitude that is more like a dance with the object, simply being with it as the situation unfolds, no striving or struggling necessary, as we get out of our own way and rest in an awareness of what is happening moment to moment.
