## Arahant

Those who have cut off the five higher fetters: desire for existence in [The Form Realm](), desire for existence in [The Formless Realm](), conceit, restlessness, and [ignorance](Ignorance.md), have no ties binding them to [Samsara](Samsara.md). These are the arahants, the final stage of [the four stages of awakening](The%20four%20stages%20of%20awakening.md), who have destroyed all defilements and are "completely liberated through final knowlege".
