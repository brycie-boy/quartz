## Arahant  #

Those who have cut off the five higher fetters: desire for existence in [[The Form Realm]], desire for existence in [[The Formless Realm]], conceit, restlessness, and [[ignorance]], have no ties binding them to [[Samsara]]. These are the arahants, the final stage of [[the four stages of awakening]], who have destroyed all defilements and are "completely liberated through final knowlege".
