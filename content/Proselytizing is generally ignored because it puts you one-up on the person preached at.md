## Proselytizing is generally ignored because it puts you one-up on the person preached at

Preaching and proselytizing is bad [Emotional-Territorial Circuit](Emotional-Territorial%20Circuit.md) politics, since it puts you one-up on the person preached-at. You are not one-up unless [imprint](Imprint.md)ed as such by being an alpha male in the same gene-pool or conditioned ([Conditioning](Conditioning.md)) as such by being a ‚Äúboss‚Äù or other authority-figure. The counter-culture of the 1960‚Äôs, like may other idealistic movements, failed because it did so much preaching from a morally one-up position when nobody had been [imprint](Imprint.md)ed or conditioned to accept it as one-up.
