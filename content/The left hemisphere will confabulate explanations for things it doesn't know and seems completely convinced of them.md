## The left hemisphere will confabulate explanations for things it doesn't know and seems completely convinced of them

[The left hemisphere of split-brain subjects has been shown to have to come up with random reasons for things the right hemisphere does](The%20left%20hemisphere%20of%20split-brain%20subjects%20has%20been%20shown%20to%20have%20to%20come%20up%20with%20random%20reasons%20for%20things%20the%20right%20hemisphere%20does.md). This may be linked to a phenomenon known as confabulation, where the [brain](Brain.md), not being able to recall something, rather than admit to a gap in its understanding, makes up something plausible, that appears consistent, to fill it. Thus, for example, in the presence of a [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) lesion, the [brain](Brain.md) loses the contextual information that would help it make sense of experience ([The right hemisphere sees things in their context](The%20right%20hemisphere%20sees%20things%20in%20their%20context.md)); the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md), nothing loath, makes up a story, and, lacking insight, appears completely convinced by it. Even in the absence of [amnesia](), the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) exhibits a strong tendency to confabulate: it thinks it knows something, recognizes something, which it doesn't, a tendency that may be linked to its lack of ability to discriminate unique cases from the generalized categories into which it places them: [The right hemisphere allows for the recognition uniqueness and familiarity, while the left only re-presents generic categories of things](The%20right%20hemisphere%20allows%20for%20the%20recognition%20uniqueness%20and%20familiarity,%20while%20the%20left%20only%20re-presents%20generic%20categories%20of%20things.md).

The [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) is the equivalent of the sort of person who, when asked for directions, prefers to make something up rather than admit to not knowing. This impression is confirmed by Panksepp: ‚ÄòThe linguistically proficient [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) ‚Ä¶ appears predisposed to repress negative emotions, and even chooses to confabulate.‚Äô To some extent perhaps we inevitably confabulate stories about our lives, a process overseen by what [Micheal Gazzaniga]() calls the [left hemisphere](Left%20hemisphere.md) ‚Äòinterpreter‚Äô. However, it is the [right hemisphere](Right%20hemisphere.md) that makes judgments about the truth or plausibility of these narratives.
