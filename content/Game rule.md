## Game rule  #🧠 

Game rules refer to the rules of a system that one must follow in order to participate in that system. For example, take the proposition "The Pope is infallible in matters of faith and morals." This may be considered to be a [[meaningless statement]] by some, and by others, it may be considered a badly formulated [[self-referential statement]]. But it may be best considered a Game Rule—it is a rule which one must except if they are to play the Roman Catholic game, and if they were to reject it, they would be automatically excluded from the Roman Catholic game.
