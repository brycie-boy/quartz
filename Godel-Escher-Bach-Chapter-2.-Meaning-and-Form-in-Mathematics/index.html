Just as Lewis Carroll took liberties with Zeno&rsquo;s Tortoise and Achilles, so have I taken liberties with Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s Tortoise and Achilles. In Carroll&rsquo;s dialogue, the same events take place over and over again, only each time on a higher and higher level; it is a wonderful analogue to Bach&rsquo;s Ever-Rising Canon. The Carrollian Dialogue, with its wit subtracted out, still leaves a deep philosophical problem: Do words and thoughts follow formal rules, or do they not? That problem is the problem of this book.</p><hr><p>57</p><p>In the Introduction, the word &ldquo;isomorphism&rdquo; was defined as an information preserving transformation. We can now go into that notion a little more deeply, and see it from another perspective. The word &ldquo;isomorphism&rsquo; applies when two complex structures can be mapped onto each other, in such a way that to each part of one structure there is a corresponding part in the other structure, where &ldquo;corresponding&rdquo; means that the two part play similar roles in their respective structures.</p><p>58</p><p>This usage of the word &ldquo;isomorphism&rdquo; is derived from a more precise notion in mathematics. It is cause for joy when a mathematician discovers an isomorphism between two structures which he knows. It is often a &ldquo;bolt from the blue&rdquo;, and a source of wonderment. The perception of an isomorphism between two known structures is a significant advance in knowledge-and I claim that it is such perceptions of isomorphism which create meanings in the minds of people. A final word on the perception of isomorphisms: since they come in many shapes and sizes, figuratively speaking, it is not always totally clear when you really have found an isomorphism. Thus, &ldquo;isomorphism&rdquo; is a word with all the usual vagueness of words—which is a deficit but an advatage as well.</p><hr><p>58</p><p>Secondly, on a higher level, there is the correspondence between true statements and theorems. But-note carefully-this higher-level correspondence could not be perceived without the prior choice of an interpretation for the symbols. Thus it would be more accurate to describe it as a correspondence between true statements and interpreted theorems. In any case we have displayed a two-tiered correspondence, which is typical of all isomorphisms.</p><p>58</p><p>When you confront a formal system you know nothing of, and if you hope to discover some hidden meaning in it, your problem is how to assign interpretations to its symbols in a meaningful way-that is, in such a way that a higher-level correspondence emerges between true statements and theorems. You may make several tentative stabs in the dark before finding a good set of words to associate with the symbols. It is very similar to attempts to crack a code, or to decipher inscriptions in an unknown language like Linear B of Crete: the only way to proceed is by trial and error, based on educated guesses. When you hit a good choice, a &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; choice, all of a sudden things just feel right, and work speeds up enormously. Pretty soon everything falls into place. The excitement of such an experience is captured in The Decipherment of Linear B by John C</p><hr><p>58</p><p>But it is uncommon, to say the least, for someone to be in the position of &ldquo;decoding&rdquo; a formal system turned up in the excavations of a ruined civilization! Mathematicians (and more recently, linguists, philosophers, and some others) are the only users of formal systems, and they invariably have an interpretation in mind for the formal systems which they use and publish. The idea of these people is to set up a formal system whose theorems reflect some portion of reality isomorphically. In such a case, the choice of symbols is a highly motivated one, as is the choice of typographical rules of production. When I devised the pq-system, I was in position. You see why I chose the symbols I chose. It is no accident theorems are isomorphic to additions; it happened because I deliberately sought out a way to reflect additions typographically</p><p>58</p><p>This symbol-word correspondence has a name: interpretation.</p><hr><p>59</p><p>You can choose interpretations other than the one I chose. You need make every theorem come out true. But there would be very little reason make an interpretation in which, say, all theorems came out false, certainly even less reason to make an interpretation under which there is no correlation at all, positive or negative, between theoremhood and truth. Let us therefore make a distinction between two types of interpretations of a formal system. First, we can have a meaningless interpretation, one in which we fail to see any isomorphic connection between theorems of system, and reality. Such interpretations abound-any random choice a will do. For instance, take this one: </p><p>p &lt;= => horse
q &lt;= => happy
.-  &lt;= => apple</p><p>Now -p-q&ndash; acquires a new interpretation: &ldquo;apple horse apple happy apple apple&rdquo;-a poetic sentiment, which might appeal to horses, and miight even lead them to favor this mode of interpreting pq-strings! However, the interpretation has very little &ldquo;meaningfulness&rdquo;; under interpretation, theorems don&rsquo;t sound any truer, or any better, than nontheorems. A horse might enjoy &ldquo;happy happy happy apple horse&rdquo; (mapped onto q q q) just as much as any interpreted theorem.</p><hr><p>59</p><p>The other kind of interpretation will be called meaningful. Under such an interpretation, theorems and truths correspond-that is, an isomorphism exists between theorems and some portion of reality. That is why it is good to distinguish between interpretations and meanings. Any old word can be used as an interpretation for &lsquo;p&rsquo;, but  &lsquo;plus&rsquo; is the only meaningful choice we&rsquo;ve come up with. In summary, the meaning of &lsquo;p&rsquo; seems to be &lsquo;plus’ though it can have a million different interpretations.</p><hr><p>59</p><p>Probably the most significant fact of this Chapter, if understood deeply, is this:</p><p>the pq-system seems to force us into recognizing that symbols of a formal system, though initially without meaning, cannot avoid taking on &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of sorts at least if an isomorphism is found.</p><p>The difference between meaning in a formal system and in a language is a very important one, however. It is this:</p><p>in a language, when we have learned a meaning for a word, we then make new <br>statements based on the meaning of the word. In a sense the meaning becomes active, since it brings into being a new rule for creating sentences. This means that our command of language is not like a finished product: the rules for making sentences increase when we learn new meanings. On the other hand, in a formal system, the theorems are predefined, by the rules of production. We can choose &ldquo;meanings&rdquo; based on an isomorphism (if we can find one) between theorems and true statements. But this does not give us the license to go out and add new theorems to the established theorems. That is what the Requirement of Formality in Chapter I was warning you of.</p><hr><p>60</p><p>In the MIU-system, of course, there was no temptation to go beyond the four <br>rules, because no interpretation was sought or found. But here, in our new system, one might be seduced by the newly found &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of each symbol into thinking that the string &ndash;p&ndash;p&ndash;p&ndash;q&mdash;&mdash;&ndash; is a theorem. At least, one might wish that this string were a theorem. But wishing doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it isn&rsquo;t. And it would be a serious mistake to think that it &ldquo;must&rdquo; be a theorem, just because 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 equals 8. It would even be misleading to attribute it any meaning at all, since it is not well-formed, and our meaningful interpretation is entirely derived from looking at well-formed strings.</p><p>60</p><p>In a formal system, the meaning must remain passive; we can read each string according to the meanings of its constituent symbols, but we do not have the right to create new theorems purely on the basis of the meanings we&rsquo;ve assigned the symbols. Interpreted formal systems straddle the line between systems without meaning, and systems with meaning. Their strings can be thought of as &ldquo;expressing&rdquo; things, but this must come only as a consequence of the formal properties of the system.</p><hr><p>60</p><p>And now, I want to destroy any illusion about having found the meanings for the symbols of the pq-system. Consider the following association: </p><p>p &lt;= => equals
q &lt;= => taken from <br>.- &lt;= => one
&ndash; &lt;= => two
etc.</p><p>Now, &ndash;p&mdash;q&mdash;- has a new interpretation: &ldquo;2 equals 3 taken from 5&rdquo;. Of course it is a true statement. All theorems will come out true under this new interpretation. It is just as meaningful as the old one. Obviously, it is silly to ask, &ldquo;But which one is the meaning of the string?&rdquo; An interpertation will be meaningful to the extent that it accurately reflects some isomorphism to the <br>real world. When different aspects of the real world are isomorphic to each other (in this case, additions and subtractions), one single formal system can be isomorphic to both, and therefore can take one two passive meanings. This kind of double-valuedness of symbols and strings is an extremely important phenomenon. Here it seems trivial curious, annoying. But it will come back in deeper contexts and bring with it a great richness of ideas.</p><hr><p>61</p><p>Here is a summary of our observations about the pq-system. Under either of the two meaningful interpretations given, every well-formed string has a grammatical assertion for its counterpart-some are true, some false. The idea of well formed strings in any formal system is that they are those strings which, when interpreted symbol for symbol, yield grammatical sentences. (Of course, it depends on the interpretation, but usually, there is one in mind.) Among the well-formed strings occur the theorems. These are defined by an axiom schema, and a rule of production. My goal in inventing the pq-system was to imitate additions: I wanted every theorem to express a true addition under interpretation; conversely, I wanted every true addition of precisely two positive integers to be translatable into a string, which would be a theorem. That goal was achieved. Notice, then fore, that all false additions, such as &ldquo;2 plus 3 equals 6&rdquo;, are mapped into strings which are well-formed, but which are not theorems.</p><p>61</p><p>This is our first example of a case where a formal system is based upon a portion of reality, and seems to mimic it perfectly, in that its theorems are isomorphic to truths about that part of reality. However, reality and the formal system are independent. Nobody need be aware that there is a isomorphism between the two. Each side stands by itself-one plus one equals two, whether or not we know that -p-q&ndash; is a theorem; and -p-q&ndash; is still a theorem whether or not we connect it with addition.</p><hr><p>61</p><p>You might wonder whether making this formal system, or any formal system, sheds new light on truths in the domain of its interpretation. Have we learned any new additions by producing pq-theorems? Certainly not but we have learned something about the nature of addition as process-namely, that it is easily mimicked by a typographical rule governing meaningless symbols. This still should not be a big surprise since addition is such a simple concept. It is a commonplace that addition can be captured in the spinning gears of a devince like a cash register.</p><hr><p>61</p><p>But it is clear that we have hardly scratched the surface, as far formal systems go; it is natural to wonder about what portion of reality can be imitated in its behavior by a set of meaningless symbols governed by formal rules. Can all of reality be turned into a formal system? In a very broad sense, the answer might appear to be yes. One could suggest, for instance, that reality is itself nothing but one very complicated formal system. Its symbols do not move around on paper, but rather in a three-dimensional vacuum (space); they are the elementary particles of which everything is composed. (Tacit assumption: that there is an end to the descending chain of matter, so that the expression &ldquo;elementary particles&rdquo; makes sense.) The &ldquo;typographical rules&rdquo; are the laws of physics, which tell how, given the positions and velocities of all particles at a given instant, to modify them, resulting in a new set of positions and velocities belonging to the  &ldquo;next&rdquo; instant. So the theorems of this grand formal system are the possible configurations of particles at different times in the history of the universe. The sole axiom is (or perhaps, was) the original configuration of all the particles at the &ldquo;beginning of time&rdquo;. This is so grandiose a conception, however, that it has only the most theoretical interest; and besides, quantum mechanics (and other parts of physics) casts at least some doubt on even the theoretical worth of this idea. Basically, we are asking if the universe operates deterministically, which is an open question.</p><hr><p>62</p><p>Instead of dealing with such a big picture, let&rsquo;s limit ourselves to mathematics as our &ldquo;real world&rdquo;. Here, a serious question arises: How can we be sure, if we&rsquo;ve tried to model a formal system on some part of mathematics, that we&rsquo;ve done the job accurately-especially if we&rsquo;re not one hundred per cent familiar with that portion of mathematics already? Suppose the goal of the formal system is to bring us new knowledge in that discipline. How will we know that the interpretation of every theorem is true, unless we&rsquo;ve proven that the isomorphism is perfect? And how will we prove that the isomorphism is perfect, if we don&rsquo;t already know all about the truths in the discipline to begin with?</p><p>62</p><p>Suppose that in an excavation somewhere, we actually did discover some <br>mysterious formal system. We would try out various interpretations and perhaps eventually hit upon one which seemed to make every theorem come out true, and every nontheorem come out false. But this is something which we could only check directly in a finite number of cases. The set of theorems is most likely infinite. How will we know that all theorems express truths under this interpretation, unless we know everything there is to know about both the formal system and the corresponding domain of interpretation?</p><hr><p>62</p><p>It is in somewhat this odd position that we will find ourselves when we attempt to match the reality of natural numbers (i.e., the nonnegative integers: 0, 1, 2, &mldr;) with the typographical symbols of a formal system. We will try to understand the relationship between what we call &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in number theory and what we can get at by symbol manipulation. So let us briefly look at the basis for calling some statements of number theory true, and others false. How much is 12 times 12? Everyone knows it is 144. But how many of the people who give that answer have actually at any time in their lives drawn a 12 by 12 rectangle, and then counted the little squares in it? Most people would regard the drawing and counting unnecessary. They would instead offer as proof a few marks on paper, such as are shown below: </p><p>12<br>x12<br>———
24
12<br>———
144</p><p>And that would be the &ldquo;proof&rdquo;. Nearly everyone believes that if you counted the squares, you would get 144 of them; few people feel that outcome is in doubt.</p><p>63</p><p>The conflict between the two points of view comes into sharper focus when you  consider the problem of determining the value 987654321 x 123456789. First of all, it is virtually impossible to construct the appropriate rectangle; and what is worse, even if it were constructed and huge armies of people spent centuries counting the little squares, only a very gullible person would be willing to believe their final answer. It is just too likely that somewhere, somehow, somebody bobbled just a little bit. So is it ever possible to know what the answer is? If you trust the symbolic process which involves manipulating digits according to certain simple rules, yes. That process is presented to children as a device which gets right answer; lost in the shuffle, for many children, are the rhyme reason of that process. The digit-shunting laws for multiplication are based mostly on a few properties of addition and multiplication which are assumed to hold for all numbers.</p><hr><p>63</p><p>The kind of assumption I mean is illustrated below. Suppose that you lay down a few sticks: </p><p>/ // // // / /</p><p>Now you count them. At the same time, somebody else counts them, starting from the other end. Is it clear that the two of you will get the same answer? The result of a counting process is independent of the way in which it is done. This is really an assumption about what counting is. i would be senseless to try to prove it, because it is so basic; either you see it or you don&rsquo;t-but in the latter case, a proof won&rsquo;t help you a bit.</p><p>64</p><p>From this kind of assumption, one can get to the commutativity and associativity of addition (i.e., first that b + c = c + b always, and second that b + (c + d) = (b + c) + d always). The same assumption can also lead you to the commutativity and associativity of multiplication; just think of many cubes assembled to form a large rectangular solid. Multiplicative commutativity <br>and associativity are just the assumptions that when you rotate the solid in various ways, the number of cubes will not change. Now these assumptions are not verifiable in all possible cases, because the number of such cases is infinite. We take them for granted; we believe them (if we ever think about them) as deeply as we could believe anything. The amount of money in our pocket will not change as we walk down the street, jostling it up and down; the number of books we have will not change if we pack them up in a box, load them into our car, drive one hundred miles, unload the box, unpack it, and place the books in a new shelf. All of this is part of what we mean by number.</p><hr><p>64</p><p>There are certain types of people who, as soon as some undeniable fact is written down, find it amusing to show why that &ldquo;fact&rdquo; is false after all. I am such a person, and as soon as I had written down the examples above involving sticks, money, and books, I invented situations in which they were wrong. You may have done the same. It goes to show that numbers as abstractions are really quite different from the everyday numbers which we use. People enjoy inventing slogans which violate basic arithmetic but which illustrate &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; truths, such as &ldquo;1 and 1 make 1&rdquo; (for lovers), or &ldquo;1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 1&rdquo; (the Trinity). You can easily pick holes in those slogans, showing why, for instance, using the plus-sign is inappropriate in both cases. But such cases proliferate. Two raindrops running down a windowpane merge; does one plus one make one? A cloud breaks up into two clouds-more evidence for the same? It is not at all easy to draw a sharp line between cases where what is happening could be called &ldquo;addition&rdquo;, and where some other word is wanted. If you think about the question, you will probably come up with some criterion involving separation of the objects in space, and making sure each one is clearly distinguishable from all the others. But then how could one count ideas? Or the number of gases comprising the atmosphere? Somewhere, if you try to look it up, you can probably find a statement such as, &ldquo;There are 17 languages in India, and 462 dialects.&rdquo; There is something strange about precise statements like that, when the concepts &ldquo;language&rdquo; and &ldquo;dialect&rdquo; are themselves fuzzy.</p><hr><p>64</p><p>Numbers as realities misbehave. However, there is an ancient and innate sense in people that numbers ought not to misbehave. There is something clean and pure in the abstract notion of number, removed from counting beads, dialects, or clouds; and there ought to be a way of talking about numbers without always having the silliness of reality come in and intrude. The hard-edged rules that govern &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; numbers constitute arithmetic, and their more advanced consequences constitute number theory. There is only one relevant question to be asked, in making the transition from numbers as practical things to numbers as formal things. Once you have decided to try to capsulize all of number theory in an ideal system, is it really possible to do the job completely? Are numbers so clean and crystalline and regular that their nature can be completely captured in the rules of a formal system? The picture Liberation (Fig. 13), one of Escher&rsquo;s most beautiful, is a marvelous contrast between the formal and the informal, with a fascinating transition region. Are numbers really as free as birds? Do they suffer as much from being crystallized into a rule-obeying system? Is there a magical transition region between numbers in reality and numbers on paper?</p><hr><p>66</p><p>When I speak of the properties of natural numbers, I don&rsquo;t just mean properties  such as the sum of a particular pair of integers. That can be found out by counting, and anybody who has grown up in this century cannot doubt the mechanizability of such processes as counting, adding, multiplying, and so on. I mean the kinds of properties which mathematicians are interested in exploring, questions for which no counting-process is sufficient to provide the answer-not even theoretically sufficient. Let us take a classic example of such a property of natural numbers. The statement is: &ldquo;There are infinitely many prime numbers.&rdquo; First of all, there is no counting process which will ever be able to confirm, or refute, this assertion. The best we could do would be to count primes for a while and concede that there are &ldquo;a lot&rdquo;. But no amount of counting alone would ever resolve the question of whether the number of primes is finite or infinite. There could always be more. The statement-and it is called &ldquo;Euclid&rsquo;s Theorem&rdquo; (notice the capital &ldquo;T&rdquo;)-is quite unobvious. It may seem reasonable, or appealing, but it is not obvious. However, mathematicians since Euclid have always called it true. What is the reason? The reason is that reasoning tells them it is so.</p><p>66</p><p>Let us follow the reasoning involved. We will look at a variant of Euclid&rsquo;s proof. This proof works by showing that whatever number you pick, there is a prime larger than it. Pick a number-N. Multiply all the positive integers starting with 1 and ending with N; in other words, form the factorial of N, written &ldquo;N!&rdquo;. What you get is divisible by every number up to N. When you add 1 to N!, the result</p><p>can&rsquo;t be a multiple of 2 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by 2);
can&rsquo;t be a multiple of 3 (because it leaves I over, when you divide by 3);
can&rsquo;t be a multiple of 4 (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by 4);
can&rsquo;t be a multiple of N (because it leaves 1 over, when you divide by N)</p><p>67</p><p>In other words, N! + 1, if it is divisible at all (other than by 1 and itself only is divisible by numbers greater than N. So either it is itself prime, or prime divisors are greater than N. But in either case we&rsquo;ve shown there must exist a prime above N. The process holds no matter what the number is. Whatever N is, there is a prime greater than N. And thus ends the demonstration of the infinitude of the primes. This last step, incidentally, is called generalization, and we will meet again later in a more formal context. It is where we phrase an argument in terms of a single number (N), and then point out that N was unspecified and therefore the argument is a general one.</p><hr><p>67</p><p>Euclid&rsquo;s proof is typical of what constitutes &ldquo;real mathematics&rdquo;. It simple, <br>compelling, and beautiful. It illustrates that by taking several rash short steps one can get a long way from one&rsquo;s starting point. In our case, the starting points are basic ideas about multiplication and division and forth. The short steps are the steps of reasoning. And though every individual step of the reasoning seems obvious, the end result is not obvious. We can never check directly whether the statement is true or not; yet we believe it, because we believe in reasoning. If you accept reasoning there seems to be no escape route; once you agree to hear Euclid out, you’ll have to agree with his conclusion. That&rsquo;s most fortunate-because it means that mathematicians will always agree on what statements to label &ldquo;true and what statements to label &ldquo;false&rdquo;.</p><hr><p>67</p><p>This proof exemplifies an orderly thought process. Each statement is related to previous ones in an irresistible way. This is why it is called &ldquo;proof&rsquo;&rsquo; rather than just &ldquo;good evidence&rdquo;. In mathematics the goal always to give an ironclad proof for some unobvious statement. The very fact of the steps being linked together in an ironclad way suggests that there may be a patterned structure binding these statements together. The structure can best be exposed by finding a new vocabulary-a stylized vocabulary, consisting of symbols-suitable only for expressing statements about numbers. Then we can look at the proof as it exists in its translated version. It will be a set of statements which are related, line by line, in some detectable way. But the statements, since they&rsquo;re represented by means a small and stylized set of symbols, take on the aspect of patterns. In other words, though when read aloud, they seem to be statements about numbers and their properties, still when looked at on paper, they seem to be abstract patterns-and the line-by-line structure of the proof may start to look like slow transformation of patterns according to some few typographical rules</p><hr><p>67</p><p>Although Euclid&rsquo;s proof is a proof that all numbers have a certain property it avoids treating each of the infinitely many cases separately. It gets around it by using phrases like &ldquo;whatever N is&rdquo;, or &ldquo;no matter what number N is&rdquo;. We could also phrase-the proof over again, so that it uses the phrase &ldquo;all N&rdquo;. By knowing the appropriate context and correct ways of using such phrases, we never have to deal with infinitely many statements. We deal with just two or three concepts, such as the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;-which, though themselves finite, embody an infinitude; and by using them, we sidestep the apparent problem that there are an infinite number of facts we want to prove.</p><hr><p>68</p><p>We use the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; in a few ways which are defined by the thought processes of reasoning. That is, there are rules which our usage of &ldquo;all&rdquo; obeys. We may be unconscious of them, and tend to claim we operate on the basis of the meaning of the word; but that, after all, is only a circumlocution for saying that we are guided by rules which we never make explicit. We have used words all our lives in certain patterns, and instead of calling the patterns &ldquo;rules&rdquo;, we attribute the courses of our thought processes to the &ldquo;meanings&rdquo; of words. That discovery was a crucial recognition in the long path towards the formalization of number theory.</p><hr><p>68</p><p>If we were to delve into Euclid&rsquo;s proof more and more carefully, we would see <br>that it is composed of many, many small-almost infinitesimal steps. If all those steps were written out line after line, the proof would appear incredibly complicated. To our minds it is clearest when several steps are telescoped together, to form one single sentence. If we tried to look at the proof in slow motion, we would begin to discern individual frames. In other words, the dissection can go only so far, and then we hit the &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; nature of reasoning processes. A proof can be broken down into a series of tiny but discontinuous jumps which seem to flow smoothly when perceived from a higher vantage point. In Chapter VIII, I will show one way of breaking the proof into atomic units, and you will see how incredibly many steps are involved. Perhaps it should not surprise you, though. The operations in Euclid&rsquo;s brain when he invented the proof must have involved millions of neurons (nerve cells), many of which fired several hundred times in a single second. The mere utterance of a sentence involves hundreds of thousands of neurons. If Euclid&rsquo;s thoughts were that complicated, it makes sense for his proof to contain a huge number of steps! (There may be little direct connection between the neural actions in his brain, and a proof in our formal system, but the complexities of the two are comparable. It is as if nature wants the complexity of the proof of the infinitude of primes to be conserved, even when the systems involved are very different from each other.)</p><hr><p>68</p><p>In Chapters to come, we will lay out a formal system that (1) includes a stylized vocabulary in which all statements about natural numbers can be expressed, and (2) has rules corresponding to all the types of reasoning which seem necessary. A very important question will be whether the rules for symbol manipulation which we have then formulated are really of equal power (as far as number theory is concerned) to our usual mental reasoning abilities-or, more generally, whether it is theoretically possible to attain the level of our thinking abilities, by using some formal system.</p><hr><a href=#notes><h3 id=notes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Notes</h3></a></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#D0A4FF}</style><script src=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bryce Mcalister using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com>Home</a></li><li><a href></a></li><li><a href></a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
