Link to: &ldquo;the just man follows his life on earth, but grows meek in its undisturbed pattern. Life becomes ritual instead of action; his domestication produced bees in barren places and roses in places where thorns naturally grow&rdquo;</p><p>0:45</p><p>based on evidence. But it was also defined by  new time & space technologies like the clock, maps, and measuring devices. This allows  cooperation because they standardize the world and make it communicable to others. But  they also make the world more complex. We have to specialize, choose which path to  follow, and trust experts more than ever.</p><p>1:14</p><p>But I think one thing in particular typifies the modern attitude – control. The sociologist Anthony Giddens described living  in the modern world as being ‘more like being aboard a careering juggernaut rather than being in  a carefully controlled and well-driven motor car.’ We can drive to some extent, but the Juggernaut  also threatens to career out of our control. It might not even be in one piece, the carriages,  wheels, drivers, and desires of the passengers all push and pull the juggernaut in different  directions, a t different intensities and speeds. But Giddens insisted we live   in a modern world, not a postmodern one – does  that mean that someone is still at the wheel? First, we should ask what we mean by  control? We might think of control as being free to decide what to do, or having  the power to act, to move things, to command people, objects, or ideas,  to make plans and then carry them out. Throughout the Medieval period, It was Kings and  noblemen – and to some extent the Church – that wielded the most power, that could command armies  and make laws. Control was in the hands of a few. Since the Enlightenment, things have become  more complicated. On the one hand, control was democratized as more people participated  in making decisions. AS capitalism developed, businesses had more control over resources and  workers. An intellectual elite emerged that, with the aid of developments like the  printing press, had control over ideas. The people had some power, too – the power to  vote, the power to protest, the power to influence laws through activism or trade unions. But above  all, it was the state that state that had ultimate authority through its monopoly on violence.  When pushed, the state had the final say. Most obviously, states controlled infrastructure,  some key industries like mining, they controlled businesses and people through regulation. To return to Gidden’s Juggernaut metaphor, states literally laid the tracks, decided  in what capacity they could be operated, and in some cases actually ran the trains.</p><p>4:12</p><p>Three things, in particular, have changed this: the fall of the soviet union, the emergence  of neoliberalism and globalization. All of these things have weakened  state control and planning, disempowered the role of intellectuals in making decisions, and strengthened businesses and corporations. Globalization, as we saw  in the last video, means that things on one side of the world – the price of resources, the  shutting of a factory, a wall street crash, the eruption of a volcano – has direct consequences  for things on the other side of the world. People are pushed and pulled around like puppets. Individuals and politicians have less control over these events. A state regulator has less power in threatening taxation of regulation of a large company if they threaten to move their operations  – quickly and easily - to another country. Prices and plans are determined  by mining, resource movement, or an unpredictable war. There are so many  factors effecting one an other that individuals and groups cannot possible have command over them.  Economies become unmanageable. We become impotent. There is no master blueprint, no metanarrative.</p><p>5:41</p><p>There is no master blueprint, no metanarrative. Sociologist Claus Offe writes that ‘The dominant pattern might be described as &ldquo;releasing  the brakes&rdquo;: deregulation, liberalization, flexibility, increased fluidity, and facilitating  &mldr; transactions on &mldr; financial real estate and labour markets, easing the tax burden, etc.&rsquo; Transnational corporations wield unprecedented levels of power. They’re able to influence  events more than governments both at home and abroad, and have larger budgets  than almost every nation on earth. As plans, blueprints, and metanarratives  lose their legitimacy, the state loses its legitimacy to do anything to. Grand old philosophers like Kant, Marx, or Mill don’t have any postmodern equivalents. Instead, its left to the people to decide. We deregulate, privatise, and dismantle the last vestiges of decaying welfare states.</p><p>7:22</p><p>Is anyone at the wheel? the postmodern answer is no. Algorithms, code, mathematical modelling, and stockmarket trends having taken control out of the hands of real people, real flesh and brains. Decisions are no longer  made in the town square or at council meetings or in board rooms but instead are manipulated  and directed in cryptic corners of cyberspace.</p><p>7:51</p><p>But this process is affects us personally too.  We no longer have one single map – one single plan or blueprint, like the Ordinance Survey Map  – but are bombarded with different maps, different apps. There’s no universally recognised system. We  have a GPS ap, a city mapper app, a tourist map, a virtual mixed-reality map. The same goes  for media outlets, weather apps, recipes, photo apps, messaging apps – we’re inundated  with choices. We become paralysed by choice.</p><p>8:58</p><p>We’re effected more by things outside our time zones, half way around the world.</p><p>9:09</p><p>Modern media ordered us – provided schedules, a few choices – the library organised the books into schemas. Now everything’s on demand, there is no categorization process, we create our  own, we’re the curators of our own experience.</p><p>9:54</p><p>What does this mean for our postmodern attitude? IN short, we find it difficult to plan, to organise, to predict. We are both more in  control of some choices and less in control of others. Authority and guidance become less  trustworthy. We’re no longer babysitted. Life is much more chaotic.</p><p>10:16</p><p>So, what happened to the advice? To those who knew what they were doing? The experts we used to trust?</p><p>11:16</p><p>Planning the future, organizing people to build, produce, and develop is, most fundamentally, a matter of communication. Effective communication with others requires, of course, a common language, standardized  measurements, codes, categories and agreeing to doing things at specified times. The philosophers, politicians, and aristocrats of the Enlightenment shared a loose vocabulary, a set of assumptions and goals which meant alliance between state, intellectuals and capitalist was possible. Information and ideas were exchanged through a  ‘republic of letters'</p><p>12:13</p><p>based on Marx’s principles. Modern life was meant to fit together like a jigsaw. This relationship has fractured. In postmodern society, tastes, values, designs, and ideas are so broad, diverse, specialized., and subject to quick change, that agreement and consensus becomes impossible. We search for advice – top 100 films, best lasagna recipe, must see tourist destinations, whether to wear masks, which car insurance – only to find that no-one agrees.  One choice is as good as any other. Individuals are left wandering and searching on their own.</p><p>13:33</p><p>No one can become an expert in anything. There is too much information. Ever more specialization is key. You can no longer be a historian but must be a historian of ‘children’s fashion in Vienna in the 1880’s’. Scientific findings change from week to week. Red wine is bad, then good, then bad but for different reasons. Masks are effective, then they’re not, then they’re effective again. What does this mean for our postmodern attitude? We don’t know who to trust. We have no guidance. We’re constantly searching. We’re wandering in the desert, as Bauman has put it. We have more control and choice in many areas but no yard-stick, no criteria for making those choices. Does this lead to nihilism? To paralysis? To pessimism?</p><p>15:10</p><p>Is the postmodern world inherently pessimistic? Does a lack of control, a lack of legitimate advice, and a lack of  leadership lead to a despondent psychology Is the postmodern world inherently  pessimistic? Does a lack of control, a lack of legitimate advice, and a lack of  leadership lead to a despondent psychology? When data can be interpreted in countless ways,   when any situation can lead to a variety of  results, when ideas, beliefs, and values can no longer be adopted rationally, when there are no  guarantees of improvement, and no more teleology, no goal that we’re moving towards, no heaven, no  utopia, no scientific solution to every problem, every illness, every malady,  where do we go from here?</p><p>15:58</p><p>Science has created a new risk for every problem  its solved. Good intentions have unintended consequences. Nuclear power? Nuclear accidents  and nuclear waste. Fossil Fuels? Global warming, flooding, lung disease. Plastic bottles? Litter  and the devastation of ecosystems. Hospitals? Superbugs. Cars? Road Accidents. Biological,  chemical, and nuclear weapons become a pervasive threat, existentially hanging over our heads threat, existentially hanging over our heads. Chernobyl, the Ozone Layer, Aids, Terrorism, Mad Cow disease – all made worse because of  globalization. Tragic events, pandemics, climate change, and financial bubbles become magnified. Where the Enlightenment was characterised by optimism, postmodernity might be said to be laced with pessimism.</p><p>17:25</p><p>Postmodernity has demonstrated that no matter how  much we try to order our lives, order society, order are plans, something always slip  through the gaps. Biases, prejudice, the outsider, the thing that doesn’t fit into the plan – all persist. Rather than universal global emancipation, we regress  to isolated nationalisms, fear, and anxiety. Values become contested. Marriage, nation, family,   work, tradition, nature – they no longer  mean what they used to mean, they’re used, misused, reinterpreted, deconstructed,  and rejected. They become empty shells.</p><p>18:52</p><p>In postmodernity, the value of marriage itself  becomes questioned, something to be discarded, people want fewer or no children.  Divorce rates skyrocket. Polyamory   returns. ‘Alternative’ lifestyles become popular.</p><p>Note: femenist movement, whore of babylon</p><p>20:44</p><p>As we become victims of unpredictability, speed, and pessimism, philosophies like stoicism return. We all become responsible for our own lives. Identity becomes difficult – change becomes more normal than stability. What does this mean for our postmodern attitude? We live in an age of psychological extremes. Pessimism and excitement, stoicism and utopianism. Scientific possibility  and scientific risk. We are schizophrenic.</p><p>21:46</p><p>So where are we going if there’s no plan? Modernity means the planning and building of factories, housing, food, medicines, and products based on simple needs. But for Bauman, postmodernity is defined less by production and more by consumption. You are not what you do but what you consume  –we’re defined by our music tastes, the games play, global trends, accessories, clothes,  even health and fitness become personalised. Postmodernity is driven less by reason, and  more by desire, by adverts that are designed to pull us in and activate a craving.</p><p>Note: Per Blake: &ldquo;The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand years is true, as I have heard from Hell. For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed, and appear infinite, and holy whereas it now appears finite & corrupt. This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment.&rdquo;</p><p>Bauman writes that ‘Seductive impulses, to be effective, must be transmitted in all directions and addressed indiscriminately to everybody who will listen.’ Shopping Malls, Las Vegas, Disney World: they all seem ordered but  it’s a façade, designed to draw us in, to encourage the short-term pursuit of  pleasure with no real long-term goal. News gets traction through clickbait,  through appeals to emotion, to shock and awe. We read the worst news because its shocking or the  best because its heartwarming, and whatevers in between gets lost. Its either ISIS or cats. Politics is left to desires too. We like big characters, joke-tellers, with  charisma and screen-presence. We’ve moved from politicians making plans based on their  own ideas to politicians being led by polling. Bauman writes that ‘The composition of political  platforms and the making of decisions on controversial issues are guided by the advance  consideration of the relative popularity of the intended move and careful calculation of  the anticipated electoral gains and losses.’ For the rest of us, politics becomes a matter  of ‘campaign politics’ – goals become fractured into divisible elements rather than any overall  ideology or metanarrative. – stopping a train line, banning trucks from the Alps, campaigning  for a new road - micro level issues dominate. Again, global issues and international  projects disintegrate into nationalisms, isolation, and local independence movements. We’re driven by issues that are personal to us, that tug on our heart strings, by news  that makes us go either awwww or ugghh.</p><p>24:34</p><p>What does this mean for our postmodern attitude?  We’re desensitised. We’ve seen the funniest cat video and the worst atrocities. Yet we’re still led by our desires, by our emotions, and the world is too. Yes, we’re still modern – we still try  to think logically and rationally – but emotions have returned – we have to go with our gut, pursue  what’s most pleasurable, we search for new tastes.</p><p>25:10</p><p>Ok, this all sounds quite negative. Difficulty in  planning, predicting, a lack of control and trust, schizophrenia, less confidence in guidance.  More responsibility placed on our shoulders, both to look after ourselves and to choose  for ourself. We’re seduced by our drives, by advertising, emotions are as important as reason. How can we possibly make sense of this? Where are we heading? Bauman has written that ‘history  has become a playground of the contingent, the unexpected, the fortuitous, the capricious,  the under-determined and the unpredictable&rsquo;’ For the moderns, time has a definite progressive  orientation towards bigger and better, a forwards and backwards, a future and a past.</p><p>26:00</p><p>Built in the middle of the 19th century, Leeds Town Hall has the word ‘forward!’  engraved in it. The planners were in no doubt which way forward was. Sartre – the last philosopher of   modernity – was interesting in building orderly,  progressive, free, and rational life-projects. Bauman writes that instead, ‘the dominant sentiment is now the feeling of a new type of uncertainty – not limited  to one’s own luck and talents, but concerning as well the future shape of the world, the right way of living in it, and the criteria by which to judge the  rights and wrongs of the way of living.’ He likens being postmodern to being either  a tourist or a vagabond, always exploring or wandering, looking around the next corner.We no longer have definitive guided tours or sacred destinations – we’re not pilgrims – instead  we’re more like modern explorers searching our own subjective experience, our own desires, our own  place – colonial exploreres of our own minds. We’re all nomads, wandering, deconstructing,  looking for meaning and belonging.</p><p>27:53</p><p>The postmodern condition defies any single  interpretation. It is dizzying, contradictory, and by its nature difficult to pin down. This  has been one of many possible narratives, and one that at times has  maybe seemed pessimistic,   but postmodernity opens up as many avenues as  it closes. We might have no guides, no priests, less legitimate leadership, but the steel cage  of certainty and oppressive authority becomes more difficult to justify and sustain itself,  too. We’re pushed and pull around by emotion, desire, advertising, and consumerism, but those  same drives are the ones that sustain the drive to create new values, new ideas, and new ways of  living. We’re schizophrenic, uncertain, wandering, yet the future is – possibly – more open  that ever. Are we destined to balance the mentalities of modernity and postmodernity – are  we both modern and postmodern at the same time? Or are we just at the edge of a new horizon.  Is something new about to make both attitudes a thing of the past?</p><hr><a href=#notes><h3 id=notes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Notes</h3></a></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#D0A4FF}</style><script src=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bryce Mcalister using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com>Home</a></li><li><a href></a></li><li><a href></a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
