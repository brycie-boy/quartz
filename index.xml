Privacy Security Education Organize:
Humanity is only poor because our the products of our labour are siezed by a few owners Since every creation is the culmination of countless contributors, no single individual should be able to claim it as their own Capitalism forces the worker to give up much of what they produce People go without because the bourgeois will limit production in order to keep prices up A lot of work in a capitalist system is wasted on useless products Every product is to some extent dependent on the external community A communist society would be forced to immedietly abandon all wage systems Communist tendencies can be seen in all individualist societies Individualist societies still have many services that do not measure individual consumption or contribution to society before use Organization would be more effecient and less constraining without government intervention Expropriation The wealth of the rich is derived from the poverty of the poor No one will sell their labour if they are given access to all things civilization produces The whole economy must be expropriated simultanuosly to ensure the success of the revolution Food, clothes and housing must also be expropriated as they are as necessary to the worker as intruments of production are themselves The revolution must handle food before any other issue The revolution should begin by taking possesion of and keeping account of all food Upon revolution, wage labour must be abolished immediatly in order to ensure that people can be fed Communes will not limit the consumption of abundent resources, and will only do so whenever it becomes scarce We should let people organize themselves freely according to immediate need The productive force of labour increased by capitalism must be seized by the workers to ensure well-being for all Under capitalism, even the well-being of highpayed workers is volatile and insecure Writers in an anarcho-communist society with work with collaborators instead of publishers to get their work published The greatest science is always self-financed Directly seeing our well-being increase in proportion to our work is a better motivator to work than a wage Most of the so-called lazy have simply found themselves in the wrong place Many people condemn laziness without enquiring into it&amp;rsquo;s cause It is often workplaces who work together without supervision who see the good quality of the work Upon abolishing private property, wages would also have to be abolished along with it A distinction between professional and simple work results in social inequalities Collectivist remuneration will only perpetuate the injustices of capitalist society Since work is the a collaborative effort of the whole of society, it is impossible to measure the individual value of labour The collectivists are aware that the needs of the individual do not always correspond to their works We should begin the organization of production around the needs of the people, rather than beginning with production Eugenics had dismissed the democratic ideal that all people are of equal value The eugenics movement first took hold in the United States in the late 1800s when immigration began to increase and immigrants filled asylums Eugenics had spread from America to Nazi Germany when their economy fell after world war I and they couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to place mentally ill soldiers in asylums German eugenicists were funded by wealthy Americans to accumulate evidence that mental illness was speading genetically The high rate of sterilization in Nazi Germany encouraged the

ADHD Depression Psychiatry&amp;rsquo;s expectation for constant positivity leads to the suppression of outrage toward oppression and the dismissal of trauma caused by society Psychiatry plays a moralizing role for society by defining behavior in terms of normal and abnormal Psychiatric diagnosis‚Äô can distort and control dissenting information by regarding rebellious behavior as a product of mental illness Psychiatric categories fulfill the need for stable identities in our chaotic late capitalist society For many people, mental illness categories are more for providing definitive identities and predictability in our chaotic late capitalist society than for mental health Psychiatric categories provide in-groups with behavioral scripts from which behavioral uniformity may be imposed People may defend their mental illnesses because challenges threaten the stability of their identity, clarity, and community Parents seek autism diagnoses for their children to acquire eligibility for school and therapeutic programs ADHD and addiction can be traced to similar causes ADHD and sleep dificiency symptoms are nearly identical Probiotic consumption has been shown to reverse depression symptoms Depression can interfear with circadian cortisol regulation Eugenics considered the mentally ill to be the most unfit The eugenics movement first took hold in the United States in the late 1800s when immigration began to increase and immigrants filled asylums Charles Davenport approached his eugenics studies by applying Mendelian inheritance to human behavior traits Aaron Rosanoff had adjusted the definition of mental illness to make his inheritance calculations more accurate in order to justify the sterilization of the mentally ill The eugenics movement had established the paradigm that mental illness was genetically inherited Although the mentally ill were far less likely to have sex, eugenicists had rationalized the notion that they were breeding prolifically by proposing that it was the unsupervised ones that were doing so People with depression generally have higher levels of glucocorticoids due to an overactive stress-response Rats previously exposed to repeated uncontrollable stressors were shown to be unable to learn how to avoid shocks People who develop learned helplessness lack the motivation to apply coping strategies in adverse situations Organisms who develop learned helplessness are less capable of perceiving the effectiveness of their coping strategies Those undergoing significant stress are more likely to develop depression Genes that predispose someone to depression are only expressed when they are repeatedly exposed to stressors Genetic theories of medical or mental conditions can enable people or society to absolve themselves from responsibility Psychiatry has not yet been able to come up with laboratory tests for psychiatric conditions Psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on subjective judgement rather than empirical tests The cutoffs in the bell-shaped curves which psychology often relies on to define normality are determined by context The two standard deviation for determining high or low IQ is arbitrary and dependent on context Psychiatrist have expanded the percentage of mental illness to fit more people in order to expand their business Mental disorder and and normality are too ambiguous to distinguish between The ambiguity between mental disorder and normality puts into question which disorders should be included in the DSM and who receives diagnosis Each mental disorder is defined by a precise set of symptoms, how many must be present, and their duration The threshold for diagnosing mental disorders are somewhat arbitrary and can be adjusted Psychiatry diagnostic thresholds oscillate to avoid over or under diagnosis Some people believe psychiatry can find the true essence of mental disorders Reliability and validity must be balanced when defining mental disorders The DSM has to prioritize reliability when defining mental disorders to prevent disagreement, which sacrifices validity By embracing reliability of definitional criteria, the DSM has become overreliant on using simple checklists to diagnose people Psychiatrists must run field trials for each new set of diagnostic criteria to prevent unpleasant surprises Field trails for new diagnostic criteria for mental disorders are unreliable for predicting future rates Field trials for diagnostic criteria for mental disorders are tested on samples of people chosen by researchers, generating better results than in real psychiatric settings It is much easier for psychiatrists to diagnose in a field study than in everyday practice Pharma companies exploit the fuzziness between mild mental disorder and being probably well to extend diagnosis and sell more drugs Mental illness rates have increased do to adjustment in definition rather than increased distress Psychiatric diagnosis tends to rise when it can lead to something valuable Psychiatrists are drawn toward premature diagnosis in order to be reimbursed by medical insurance companies Before the 70s, psychiatric drugs were very risky and were only given to the sickest of patients During the 70s, psychiatric drugs became much less risky and were beginning to be offered to the wider temporarily distressed public In the late 80s and 90s, new SSRIs began to sell widely and rapidly After the 90s, antipsychotics began to be prescribed carelessly even to non-schizophrenics Pharma finds its biggest market for psychiatric drugs in the worried well rather than the genuinely mentally ill Finding meaning in our suffering can counter act the tendency instilled in us by conventional psychiatry to be ashamed of our unhappiness As of 2010, 85 percent of students have depression and anxiety scores higher than the average in the 50s As of 2010, suicide rates have quadrupled for students under 15 and and doubled for those between 15 and 24 Scores for MMPI and MMPI-A tests rose significantly between 1938 and 1989 Locus of control Internal-External Locus of Control Scale Free play can elevate mental illness in students by giving them a sense of control, allowing them to confront risk, letting them learn social skills and allowing to find their passions Studies have shown children to be the least happy while in school and the most

Breakthrough moments are the result of the compounding of incremental actions Goldilocks Rule Improvement requires behaviors to remain novel in order to maintain engangement To really become proficient in something, you will inevitably have to embrace boredom The evolutionary function of guilt is to prevent us from disappointing parental figures Learned helplessness Rats previously exposed to repeated uncontrollable stressors were shown to be unable to learn how to avoid shocks People who develop learned helplessness lack the motivation to apply coping strategies in adverse situations Organisms who develop learned helplessness are less capable of perceiving the effectiveness of their coping strategies Those undergoing significant stress are more likely to develop depression Poverty can bring many psychological stressors The poor are less able to plan for the future and can only respond to present stressors The poor have less outlets to help deal with stress Xenophobia Working memory Classical conditioning Will to meaning Existential frustration No√∂genic neuroses Existential frustration does not always entail neurosis Having meaning to ones life can help someone withstand even the worst conditions No√∂-dynamics Existential vacuum The existential vacuum has spread through humanity due to the lack of instincts to help guide human behavior The existential vacuum has spread through humanity due to the lack of a central tradition to our their lives The existential vacuum may be numbed by the pursuit of power or pleasure The logotherapist tries to broaden the patients attention to potential meaning and responsibility in the world Meaning must be found in the outside world rather than being created in ones own mind We can find meaning in uncontrollable suffering by taking it as a challenge to triumph and change our attitudes If suffering is avoidable, we should strive to remove it rather than endure it Finding meaning in our suffering can counter act the tendency instilled in us by conventional psychiatry to be ashamed of our unhappiness Since suffering is unavoidable, it can be a constant source of meaning Lack of predictability predicts stress-response Lack of control predicts stress-response Behaviorism assumes that it is external entities that control learning Psychologists were quick to begin using conditioning on children soon after it&amp;rsquo;s conception The behaviorist model of learning overlooks the role of the students own experience of learning Around the 1960s, cognitive psychologists became dissatisfied with behaviorism for understanding learning and started focusing more on thought Cognitive scientists measured learning through observation of natural learning or through tests in controlled settings The cognitive science approach to learning strips it of it&amp;rsquo;s context and meaning to the student A cognitive model of learning which suggests that learning is only the commitment of information to long-term memory has gained precedence in schools Schools have extrapolated form chess professionals that storing information into long-term memory ahead of time will prepare them for expertise later People become experts in something by actively doing it rather than by preparing for it Experts have purpose and context in what they learn because they have chosen to learn it The cognitive approach to learning overlooks the role of environment in a students capacity to learn something Children make logical choices based on what they already know when confronted with contradictory information Instructing a child&amp;rsquo;s education can prevent them from learning other possibilities by making them more likely to imitate Children learn by actively using their own prior knowledge to understand new experiences Informally educated children learn through personal observation and imitation, whereas school children tend to learn by waiting for someone else to show them what to do Education should be oriented toward whatever is important in the students particular culture and environment Community of practice Learning outside of school involves active doing and purpose, whereas learning in school involves abstracted standardized outcomes Learning by immersion makes it difficult to ascertain ones progress because their are no preconfigured testing methods Thought-terminating clich√© Stress experienced by humans is generally psychological or social Natural consequences allow people to make associations between actions and their inherent consequences Natrual consequences foster intrinsic motivation Jump out of the system Mechanic mode Being self-reliant means living in the present and not relying on previous authority&amp;rsquo;s Societies overvaluation of interpersonal relationships has lead people to overlook other ways of finding personal fulfillment Solitude allows for self-change and self-discovery by freeing us from the needs and
