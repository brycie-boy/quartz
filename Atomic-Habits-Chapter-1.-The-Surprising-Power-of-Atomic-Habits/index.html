Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 238</p><p>we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 239</p><p>Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 241</p><p>Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 242</p><p>Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 243</p><p>1% BETTER EVERY DAY 1% worse every day for one year. 0.99365 = 00.03 1% better every day for one year. 1.01365 = 37.78</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 247</p><p>The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 249</p><p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 250</p><p>They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 251</p><p>It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.</p><hr><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 256</p><p>Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.</p><hr><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 261</p><p>The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.* Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 267</p><p>That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s not going to end well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re moving slower than you’d like.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 274</p><p>If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 277</p><p>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.</p><hr><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 306</p><p>Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 307</p><p>This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 309</p><p>Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 313</p><p>This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential. If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 318</p><p>Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 320</p><p>When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress—that makes the jump today possible.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 328</p><p>THE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL</p><p>Note - Location 330</p><p>Image</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 332</p><p>FIGURE 2: We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have done. This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 336</p><p>All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.</p><hr><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 341</p><p>FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 342</p><p>Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set specific, actionable goals. For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I wanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 348</p><p>Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.</p><p>Note - Location 348</p><p>As was mentioned in The Craving Mind, when we think about something we desire, it releases dopamine, the chemical associated with craving, and we can become addicted to thinking and mind wandering. In the context of goals, goals make you think about what you don’t have and what you wish you did have, thus goals leave you never satisfied and always feeling like you need to accomplish more. Discarding goals makes you more present and satifsied. When you focus on systems, life is a constant suprise. Also, what someone considers a reasonable goal seems a on there expectations of themselves. If someone has high expectation they may give themselves goals that are too big and feel less motivated</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 357</p><p>The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</p><hr><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 370</p><p>Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 373</p><p>Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.</p><hr><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 377</p><p>Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.</p><p>The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.</p><hr><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 387</p><p>Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.</p><p>Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 393</p><p>If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p><hr><a href=#notes><h3 id=notes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Notes</h3></a><ul><li><a href=/We-tend-to-overestimate-the-importance-of-one-defining-moment-and-underestimate-the-effect-of-small-actions-on-a-daily-basis/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/We-tend-to-overestimate-the-importance-of-one-defining-moment-and-underestimate-the-effect-of-small-actions-on-a-daily-basis/>We tend to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the effect of small actions on a daily basis</a></li><li><a href=/Our-bad-decisions-may-seem-insubstantial-in-the-short-term-but-if-repeated-can-compound-over-the-long-term/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Our-bad-decisions-may-seem-insubstantial-in-the-short-term-but-if-repeated-can-compound-over-the-long-term/>Our bad decisions may seem insubstantial in the short term but if repeated can compound over the long term</a></li><li><a href=/The-trajectory-your-daily-actions-are-leading-you-toward-matters-more-than-their-current-results/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/The-trajectory-your-daily-actions-are-leading-you-toward-matters-more-than-their-current-results/>The trajectory your daily actions are leading you toward matters more than their current results</a></li><li><a href=/Focus-on-systems-instead-of-goals/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Focus-on-systems-instead-of-goals/>Focus on systems instead of goals</a></li><li><a href=/Setting-goals-leaves-you-continuously-putting-your-satisfaction-off-until-the-next-milestone/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Setting-goals-leaves-you-continuously-putting-your-satisfaction-off-until-the-next-milestone/>Setting goals leaves you continuously putting your satisfaction off until the next milestone</a></li><li><a href=/Completing-a-goal-only-provides-temporary-change-while-systems-maintain-continuous-progress/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Completing-a-goal-only-provides-temporary-change-while-systems-maintain-continuous-progress/>Completing a goal only provides temporary change, while systems maintain continuous progress</a></li><li><a href=/After-we-accomplish-a-goal-we-have-nothing-to-motivate-us-to-continue-working/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/After-we-accomplish-a-goal-we-have-nothing-to-motivate-us-to-continue-working/>After we accomplish a goal, we have nothing to motivate us to continue working</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#D0A4FF}</style><script src=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bryce Mcalister using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com>Home</a></li><li><a href></a></li><li><a href></a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
