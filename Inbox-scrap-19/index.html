Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 421</p><p>However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 425</p><p>Our first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. To understand what I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur. You can imagine them like the layers of an onion.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 431</p><p>The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 433</p><p>The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 435</p><p>The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 437</p><p>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 440</p><p>Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 450</p><p>Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 453</p><p>The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone who smokes.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 455</p><p>Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 458</p><p>Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 460</p><p>You can imagine many ways to try to get more people to vote in a democracy, but such behavior change would never get off the ground in a dictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 462</p><p>A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals, organizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 464</p><p>You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 465</p><p>You may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 466</p><p>It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 475</p><p>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 477</p><p>The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 481</p><p>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are. The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 488</p><p>Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 489</p><p>Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 493</p><p>when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 494</p><p>Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 496</p><p>Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity. “I’m terrible with directions.” “I’m not a morning person.” “I’m bad at remembering people’s names.” “I’m always late.” “I’m not good with technology.” “I’m horrible at math.” . . . and a thousand other variations.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 504</p><p>When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 507</p><p>The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 510</p><p>On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 512</p><p>This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 517</p><p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.* More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 520</p><p>The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 523</p><p>Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you have evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour every night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 525</p><p>The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 532</p><p>The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 535</p><p>We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 536</p><p>Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you finish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If you go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If you practice playing the guitar, perhaps you are the type of person who likes music.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 540</p><p>meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 542</p><p>Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 548</p><p>Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 550</p><p>Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 551</p><p>The good news is that you don’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes for both sides. You don’t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 555</p><p>It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 558</p><p>First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 560</p><p>These are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin—but they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double their salary. That’s fine. Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a new language? Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up? For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based). This process can lead to beliefs like: “I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.” “I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy they need.” “I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 574</p><p>The concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to another key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 584</p><p>Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 586</p><p>Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 587</p><p>Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.</p><p>3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 600</p><p>IN 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment that would lay the foundation for our understanding of how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior. Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 603</p><p>He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door “by some simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform.” For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 606</p><p>Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would happen to press the magical lever, the door would open, and they would escape.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 608</p><p>Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 611</p><p>After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example, Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act. 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 613</p><p>During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 615</p><p>From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 617</p><p>His work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers to some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And why does the brain bother building them at all?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 619</p><p>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 622</p><p>Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. You’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 624</p><p>Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution. You’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you down. You’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that playing video games relaxes you. You’re exploring, exploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 627</p><p>After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What did I do right before that?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 628</p><p>This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 629</p><p>With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 630</p><p>Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 631</p><p>As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 632</p><p>As habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 633</p><p>When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation. Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that. These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is appropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice that once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 637</p><p>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 639</p><p>The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 640</p><p>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 641</p><p>As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 644</p><p>Despite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits of habits. The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull? I don’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. They make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two complement each other.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 647</p><p>Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 650</p><p>If you’re always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work out, where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time for freedom.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 651</p><p>It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 652</p><p>Conversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 655</p><p>The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 661</p><p>This four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain runs through these steps in the same order each time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 662</p><p>First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 663</p><p>Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 665</p><p>(Of course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 666</p><p>Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 668</p><p>Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 669</p><p>What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 671</p><p>Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 672</p><p>Cravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of information could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not motivated by the same cues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines can be a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background noise.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 675</p><p>Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 676</p><p>The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 678</p><p>Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 680</p><p>Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 682</p><p>The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect. Getting in shape improves your health and your dating prospects. But the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain status or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 686</p><p>Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 689</p><p>If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 696</p><p>The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This “habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 699</p><p>In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 700</p><p>Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits. This cycle is known as the habit loop.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 702</p><p>This four-step process is not something that happens occasionally, but rather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active during every moment you are alive—even now. The brain is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 704</p><p>The entire process is completed in a split second, and we use it again and again without realizing everything that has been packed into the previous moment.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 705</p><p>We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire. Problem phase 1. Cue 2. Craving Solution phase 3. Response 4. Reward</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 712</p><p>All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 757</p><p>By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact that we tie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster after each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting home from work. After decades of mental programming, we automatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 761</p><p>the four stages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly everything we do each day.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 762</p><p>we need to transform these four steps into a practical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 763</p><p>I refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones. You can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior. When the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless. When they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 766</p><p>How to Create a Good Habit The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 772</p><p>How to Break a Bad Habit Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 778</p><p>the Four Laws of Behavior Change apply to nearly every field, from sports to politics, art to medicine, comedy to management. These laws can be used no matter what challenge you are facing. There is no need for completely different strategies for each habit.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 780</p><p>Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 785</p><p>If you have ever wondered, “Why don’t I do what I say I’m going to do? Why don’t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement or start that side business? Why do I say something is important but never seem to make time for it?” The answers to those questions can be found somewhere in these four laws. The key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 789</p><p>Your habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters that follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and show how you can use them to create a system in which good habits emerge naturally and bad habits wither away.</p><p>4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 820</p><p>The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. Whenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 823</p><p>With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t always explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 826</p><p>We underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without thinking. You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your lungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles all this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious self.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 828</p><p>Consider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time to eat. Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body has a variety of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time to eat again and that track what is going on around you and within you.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 831</p><p>Cravings can arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating through your body. Suddenly, you’re hungry even though you’re not quite sure what tipped you off.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 832</p><p>This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 834</p><p>It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 837</p><p>the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become to question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 844</p><p>Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible:</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 845</p><p>Our responses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 847</p><p>Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 850</p><p>The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice that the conductors have a peculiar habit. As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 857</p><p>This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 860</p><p>Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 864</p><p>The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 867</p><p>One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives.</p><p>Note - Location 869</p><p>Mindfulness</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 869</p><p>That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 882</p><p>Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 895</p><p>The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals. For someone who is trying to lose weight, eating a bagel with peanut butter every morning might be a bad habit. For someone who is trying to bulk up and add muscle, the same behavior might be a good habit. It all depends on what you’re working toward.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 898</p><p>Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as well. The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 900</p><p>For this exercise, categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run. Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 903</p><p>If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 905</p><p>As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes.</p><p>Note - Location 907</p><p>Literally definition of mindfulness</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 908</p><p>If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as if you were watching someone else.

It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Just saying out loud, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,” increases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re getting yourself to acknowledge the need for action—and that can make all the difference.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 918</p><p>Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a way that benefits you.</p><p>5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 930</p><p>IN 2001, RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with 248 people to build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The subjects were divided into three groups.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 932</p><p>The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to track how often they exercised.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 933</p><p>The second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not only to track their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits of exercise. The researchers also explained to the group how exercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve heart health.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 935</p><p>Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when and where they would exercise over the following week. Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 938</p><p>In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 941</p><p>The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 942</p><p>The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 945</p><p>Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 953</p><p>people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 954</p><p>Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 956</p><p>An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like “I want to work out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should vote” and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 958</p><p>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 959</p><p>Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait for inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I meditate this morning or at lunch? When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 962</p><p>The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 969</p><p>If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 971</p><p>Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 972</p><p>We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 974</p><p>Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 991</p><p>Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 995</p><p>Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 997</p><p>No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 998</p><p>When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1000</p><p>Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1003</p><p>The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1012</p><p>The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1013</p><p>This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot Effect.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1034</p><p>Overall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for which action should come next.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1035</p><p>Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate:</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1047</p><p>No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1047</p><p>Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time and location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine can make a big difference.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1050</p><p>Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1053</p><p>One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits Scorecard from the last chapter as a starting point.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1054</p><p>Alternatively, you can create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the habits you do each day without fail.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1069</p><p>In the second column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1074</p><p>Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1075</p><p>Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1079</p><p>Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. The specificity is important. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.</p><p>6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More ❗️</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1111</p><p>People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1114</p><p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1116</p><p>In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.</p><p>7: The Secret to Self-Control</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1238</p><p>Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that completely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. In other words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1241</p><p>This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1242</p><p>Instead, Robins revealed that addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1246</p><p>Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean—which is devoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous cues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. It’s no wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact opposite of those in the Vietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users become re-addicted once they return home from rehab.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1250</p><p>The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy behavior as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1254</p><p>people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1256</p><p>The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1257</p><p>So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1259</p><p>This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1263</p><p>The cues were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1263</p><p>Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change techniques can backfire.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1267</p><p>If you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1267</p><p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1271</p><p>Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1273</p><p>This process is happening all the time—often without us realizing it. Scientists have found that showing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain and sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to consciously register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you what they had seen—but they craved the drug all the same.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1275</p><p>Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1277</p><p>And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1278</p><p>In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1280</p><p>A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1289</p><p>This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1291</p><p>Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.</p><p>Note - Location 1293</p><p>I also feel that sometimes this strategy just isn’t possible and you inevitably have to confront craving. I hypothesize that the more you don’t react to a craving the less intensity it will have over time</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1293</p><p>This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.</p><p>8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible</p><p>9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1510</p><p>whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1512</p><p>Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1514</p><p>Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed increased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1517</p><p>We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and groups comes with its own set of expectations and standards—when</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1520</p><p>In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day. You’re always keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not top of your mind.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1521</p><p>Often, you follow the habits of your culture without thinking, without questioning, and sometimes without remembering. As the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices of life in society sweep us along.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1527</p><p>We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close. The many. The powerful.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1532</p><ol><li>Imitating the Close</li></ol><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1532</p><p>Proximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true of the social environment.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1534</p><p>We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1536</p><p>I find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body posture of the other person. In college, I began to talk like my roommates. When traveling to other countries, I unconsciously imitate the local accent despite reminding myself to stop.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1538</p><p>As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. One groundbreaking study tracked twelve thousand people for thirty-two years and found that “a person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who became obese.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1540</p><p>It works the other way, too. Another study found that if one person in a relationship lost weight, the other partner would also slim down about one third of the time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1542</p><p>Our friends and family provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1543</p><p>Of course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad influences.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1545</p><p>Similarly, one study found that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after controlling for natural levels of intelligence.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1547</p><p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1550</p><p>Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise together.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1551</p><p>To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step further. Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1553</p><p>Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which “helps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose weight, get strong, and get healthy.” His clients include video game lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in shape. Many people feel out of place the first time they go to the gym or try to change their diet, but if you are already similar to the other members of the group in some way—say, your mutual love of Star Wars—change becomes more appealing because it feels like something people like you already do.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1557</p><p>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1562</p><ol start=2><li>Imitating the Many</li></ol><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1562</p><p>In the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a series of experiments that are now taught to legions of undergrads each year. To begin each experiment, the subject entered the room with a group of strangers. Unbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors planted by the researcher and instructed to deliver scripted answers to certain questions.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1565</p><p>The group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a second card with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the line on the second card that was similar in length to the line on the first card.</p><p>Note - Location 1569</p><p>Image </p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1570</p><p>FIGURE 10: This is a representation of two cards used by Solomon Asch in his famous social conformity experiments. The length of the line on the first card (left) is obviously the same as line C, but when a group of actors claimed it was a different length the research subjects would often change their minds and go with the crowd rather than believe their own eyes.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1573</p><p>The experiment always began the same. First, there would be some easy trials where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few rounds, the participants were shown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones, except the actors in the room would select an intentionally incorrect answer. For example, they would respond “A” to the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree that the lines were the same even though they were clearly different.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1577</p><p>The subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately become bewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They would laugh nervously to themselves. They would double-check the reactions of other participants. Their agitation would grow as one person after another delivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject began to doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they delivered the answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1580</p><p>Asch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways. What he discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did the conformity of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor, then there was no effect on the person’s choice. They just assumed they were in the room with a dummy. When two actors were in the room with the subject, there was still little impact. But as the number of people increased to three actors and four and all the way to eight, the subject became more likely to second-guess themselves. By the end of the experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the group answer even though it was obviously incorrect.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1585</p><p>Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1587</p><p>But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1590</p><p>Humans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1593</p><p>The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1595</p><p>When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive.

We want pins and medallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in our titles. We want to be acknowledged, recognized, and praised.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1598</p><p>This tendency can seem vain, but overall, it’s a smart move. Historically, a person with greater power and status has access to more resources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a more attractive mate.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1600</p><p>We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the most accomplished children because these things separate us from the crowd. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1602</p><p>This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1603</p><p>Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire. You replicate the marketing strategies of the most successful firms in your industry. You make a recipe from your favorite baker. You borrow the storytelling strategies of your favorite writer. You mimic the communication style of your boss. We imitate people we envy.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1606</p><p>High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1607</p><p>We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want to be the slob of the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because we don’t want to be judged. We are continually wondering “What will others think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the answer.</p><p>10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1651</p><p>Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive. I often have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If you were to ask me why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t say, “Because I need food to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I am motivated to eat tacos because I have to eat to survive. The underlying motive is to obtain food and water even if my specific craving is for a taco.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1655</p><p>Some of our underlying motives include:* Conserve energy Obtain food and water Find love and reproduce Connect and bond with others Win social acceptance and approval Reduce uncertainty Achieve status and prestige</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1662</p><p>A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1665</p><p>Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature. Find love and reproduce = using Tinder Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook Win social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google Achieve status and prestige = playing video games</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1672</p><p>Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1673</p><p>Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address the same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress by smoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1677</p><p>Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1677</p><p>As we covered in our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1679</p><p>Cue: You notice that the stove is hot. Prediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it. Cue: You see that the traffic light turned green. Prediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the intersection and get closer to my destination, so I should step on the gas. You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the appropriate response.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1683</p><p>This all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in your habits because every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1686</p><p>Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put another way, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1687</p><p>Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1688</p><p>The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1689</p><p>These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply. They help explain what we are currently sensing. For instance, whether or not you realize it, you are noticing how warm or cold you feel right now. If the temperature drops by one degree, you probably won’t do anything. If the temperature drops ten degrees, however, you’ll feel cold and put on another layer of clothing. Feeling cold was the signal that prompted you to act. You have been sensing the cues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that you would be better off in a different state that you take action.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1694</p><p>A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1697</p><p>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1698</p><p>what you really want is not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel different.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1700</p><p>Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1701</p><p>Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions. We have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1705</p><p>Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1707</p><p>You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1708</p><p>For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1710</p><p>Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1711</p><p>You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1714</p><p>We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1714</p><p>I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1717</p><p>Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1718</p><p>Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1721</p><p>Finance. Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However, you can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living below your current means increases your future means. The money you save this month increases your purchasing power next month.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1723</p><p>Meditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next distraction inevitably pops into your mind. You can transform frustration into delight when you realize that each interruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you need distractions to practice meditation.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1741</p><p>You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love. Maybe you take three deep breaths and smile. Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat. Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy. Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with the original situation.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1747</p><p>The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one.</p><p>11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1798</p><p>It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1800</p><p>refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1801</p><p>When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1802</p><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1805</p><p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1806</p><p>Only the action of working out will get the result you’re looking to achieve.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1807</p><p>If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1808</p><p>Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1810</p><p>It’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you’re still making progress. You think, “I’ve got conversations going with four potential clients right now. This is good. We’re moving in the right direction.” Or, “I brainstormed some ideas for that book I want to write. This is coming together.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1813</p><p>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1815</p><p>If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1817</p><p>Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. With each repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural connections tighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1822</p><p>Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. In musicians, the cerebellum—critical for physical movements like plucking a guitar string or pulling a violin bow—is larger than it is in nonmusicians. Mathematicians, meanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior parietal lobule, which plays a key role in computation and calculation. Its size is directly correlated with the amount of time spent in the field; the older and more experienced the mathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1826</p><p>When scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found that the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial memory—was significantly larger in their subjects than in non–taxi drivers. Even more fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a driver retired.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1828</p><p>Like the muscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1829</p><p>Of course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was recognized long before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860, the English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1834</p><p>Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1837</p><p>All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1839</p><p>It looks something like this: THE HABIT LINE</p><p>Note - Location 1841</p><p>Image</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1841</p><p>FIGURE 11: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold—the habit line—the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. A new habit has been formed.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1845</p><p>On the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers track the level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten minutes each day. The shape of these charts, which scientists call learning curves, reveals an important truth about behavior change: habits form based on frequency, not time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1847</p><p>WALKING 10 MINUTES PER DAY</p><p>Note - Location 1848</p><p>Image</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1849</p><p>FIGURE 12: This graph shows someone who built the habit of walking for ten minutes after breakfast each day. Notice that as the repetitions increase, so does automaticity, until the behavior is as easy and automatic as it can be.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1853</p><p>There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days or three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or two hundred times. It’s the frequency that makes the difference. Your current habits have been internalized over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of repetitions.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1856</p><p>New habits require the same level of frequency. You need to string together enough successful attempts until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.</p><p>14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2153</p><p>Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2156</p><p>A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2159</p><p>There are many ways to create a commitment device. You can reduce overeating by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in bulk size. You can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos and online poker sites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of athletes who have to “make weight” for a competition choosing to leave their wallets at home during the week before weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2162</p><p>As another example, my friend and fellow habits expert Nir Eyal purchased an outlet timer, which is an adapter that he plugged in between his internet router and the power outlet. At 10 p.m. each night, the outlet timer cuts off the power to the router. When the internet goes off, everyone knows it is time to go to bed.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2164</p><p>Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter to split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If I waited until the meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half,” it would never work.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2167</p><p>The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling motivated to get in shape, schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the business you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up a consulting call. When the time comes to act, the only way to bail is to cancel the meeting, which requires effort and may cost money.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2186</p><p>The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2188</p><p>Some actions—like installing a cash register—pay off again and again. These onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value over time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2215</p><p>Of course, there are many ways to automate good habits and eliminate bad ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work for you. Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior. This is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too infrequently to become habitual. Things you have to do monthly or yearly—like rebalancing your investment portfolio—are never repeated frequently enough to become a habit, so they benefit in particular from technology “remembering” to do them for you.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2225</p><p>When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2246</p><p>When working in your favor, automation can make your good habits inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to lock in future behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment. By utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can create an environment of inevitability—a space where good habits are not just an outcome you hope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.</p><p>15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2325</p><p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2337</p><p>Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2340</p><p>Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2342</p><p>The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2346</p><p>Imagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of Africa—a giraffe or an elephant or a lion. On any given day, most of your decisions have an immediate impact. You are always thinking about what to eat or where to sleep or how to avoid a predator. You are constantly focused on the present or the very near future. You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2349</p><p>Now switch back to your human self. In modern society, many of the choices you make today will not benefit you immediately. If you do a good job at work, you’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today, perhaps you won’t be overweight next year. If you save money now, maybe you’ll have enough for retirement decades from now. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2353</p><p>The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The earliest remains of modern humans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old. These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2357</p><p>It is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2358</p><p>Compared to the age of the brain, modern society is brand-new.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2360</p><p>The world has changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed little.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2360</p><p>Similar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors spent their days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal, and taking shelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value on instant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2363</p><p>Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.* You value the present more than the future. Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2366</p><p>But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems. Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually transmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings now. Overeating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the moment. Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away. Disease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks, even years.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2372</p><p>Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.” Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2377</p><p>The brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for your future self. And when you envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits. We all want better lives for our future selves. However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2381</p><p>As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2383</p><p>With a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some behaviors and avoid others, let’s update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2385</p><p>Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2388</p><p>This is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills. We’ve all seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay watching television and get your homework done, you’ll generally learn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts and chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when you get home. At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2392</p><p>Here’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2398</p><p>In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the real world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have provided you with something.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2402</p><p>This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2403</p><p>What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2407</p><p>Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with habits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol this month” because nothing happens when you skip happy hour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about that.</p><p>16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2443</p><p>IN 1993, a bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-three-year-old stockbroker named Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most of the big business deals were being made. Given the location, and the fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit. Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep dialing the phone until I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me. Within eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the firm. By age twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the equivalent of $125,000 today. Not long after, he landed a six-figure job with another company.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2451</p><p>I like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over the years, I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways. One woman shifted a hairpin from one container to another whenever she wrote a page of her book. Another man moved a marble from one bin to the next after each set of push-ups.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2453</p><p>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2455</p><p>Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2466</p><p>“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2468</p><p>Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2470</p><p>Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2470</p><p>Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2472</p><p>Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t. One study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2475</p><p>Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day. One glance at the paper clips in the container and you immediately know how much work you have (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2478</p><p>Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2479</p><p>The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2481</p><p>This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling down, it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made. Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get started because you don’t want to lose your progress by breaking the streak.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2484</p><p>Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2484</p><p>This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2487</p><p>Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2518</p><p>No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life will interrupt you at some point.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2520</p><p>Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice. If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2522</p><p>As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the next one.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2523</p><p>The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2524</p><p>This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2527</p><p>Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2532</p><p>This is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your compounding.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2534</p><p>Furthermore, it’s not always about what happens during the workout. It’s about being the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2545</p><p>The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success is measured by quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting for quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower number on the scale, even if that means embracing crash diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to “win” whatever game is being played.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2549</p><p>This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2552</p><p>This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2554</p><p>In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.</p><p>17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2590</p><p>Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2592</p><p>The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at his job. The possibility of a customer never returning makes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut carefully. When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2595</p><p>The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2597</p><p>We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. There can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2599</p><p>As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to change. Customers pay their bills on time when they are charged a late fee. Students show up to class when their grade is linked to attendance. We’ll jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2601</p><p>There is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely on punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a restaurant or failing to recycle adds consequence to an action. Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2613</p><p>Laws and regulations are an example of how government can change our habits by creating a social contract.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2615</p><p>The group agrees to act in a certain way, and if you don’t follow along, you’ll be punished.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2617</p><p>you can create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2648</p><p>We are always trying to present our best selves to the world. We comb our hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully because we know these habits are likely to get a positive reaction. We want to get good grades and graduate from top schools to impress potential employers and mates and our friends and family. We care about the opinions of those around us because it helps if others like us. This is precisely why getting an accountability partner or signing a habit contract can work so well.</p><p>18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2737</p><p>In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2738</p><p>The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2742</p><p>Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2743</p><p>Genes have been shown to influence everything from the number of hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to marry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine. There’s a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2746</p><p>As Robert Plomin, a behavioral geneticist at King’s College in London, told me, “It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits have a genetic component because we literally can’t find a single one that isn’t influenced by our genes.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2748</p><p>Bundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a particular personality. Your personality is the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2750</p><p>The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2752</p><p>Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2753</p><p>Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2755</p><p>Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2756</p><p>Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2758</p><p>Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2759</p><p>All five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion, for instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away. When the researchers tracked these children through life, they found that the babies who turned toward the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away were more likely to become introverts.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2762</p><p>People who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and warm. They also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an important role in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can act as a natural antidepressant.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2765</p><p>As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been linked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for noticing threats. In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2768</p><p>Our habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there is no doubt that our genes nudge us in a certain direction.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2786</p><p>How do you pick the right habit? The first step is something we covered in the 3rd Law: make it easy. In many cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too difficult. When a habit is easy, you are more likely to be successful. When you are successful, you are more likely to feel satisfied.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2789</p><p>However, there is another level to consider. In the long-run, if you continue to advance and improve, any area can become challenging. At some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your skillset. How do you figure that out?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2791</p><p>The most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a problem with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try every career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit trade-off.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2793</p><p>In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2795</p><p>After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2798</p><p>In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2799</p><p>Google famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2801</p><p>The optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. If you have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—it makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a good amount of time to exploit it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2802</p><p>If you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on the deadline for a project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found so far and get some results.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2804</p><p>As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2805</p><p>What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2808</p><p>What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some degree.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2811</p><p>Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2814</p><p>What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2821</p><p>But what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck? If you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2822</p><p>Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, “Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2826</p><p>When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2827</p><p>You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2828</p><p>A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2831</p><p>It was also easier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone else. After all, nobody else was taking the same combination of classes, so who could say if they were better or worse?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2839</p><p>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2842</p><p>Biological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2845</p><p>Furthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing the work. Yes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes, but if you haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.</p><p>20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2968</p><p>HABITS CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR MASTERY. In chess, it is only after the basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space for more effortful thinking. This is true for any endeavor. When you know the simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2972</p><p>However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2975</p><p>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—not improving them.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2977</p><p>In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2981</p><p>when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice. Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2984</p><p>To become great, certain skills do need to become automatic. Basketball players need to be able to dribble without thinking before they can move on to mastering layups with their nondominant hand.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2987</p><p>But after one habit has been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and begin building the next habit.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2988</p><p>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2989</p><p>Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it doesn’t get easier overall because now you’re pouring your energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It’s an endless cycle.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2991</p><p>MASTERING ONE HABIT</p><p>Note - Location 2993</p><p>Image</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2994</p><p>MASTERING A FIELD</p><p>Note - Location 2996</p><p>Image</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 2998</p><p>FIGURE 16: The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3000</p><p>Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve. It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill—right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3002</p><p>The solution? Establish a system for reflection and review.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3037</p><p>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3047</p><p>I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3050</p><p>Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary—like Pat Riley adjusting the effort of his players on a nightly basis. You don’t want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3052</p><p>Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3055</p><p>Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions: What went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What did I learn?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3059</p><p>Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wish to become.*</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3062</p><p>My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions: What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3067</p><p>These two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—but they are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual slide that happens when I don’t pay close attention. They provide an annual reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me become the type of person I wish to be. They indicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on new challenges and when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3070</p><p>Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. There is too much feedback.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3072</p><p>Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror. You aren’t aware of easily fixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your teeth. There is too little feedback.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3074</p><p>Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to view the entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3076</p><p>Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of behavior change: identity.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3078</p><p>In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3079</p><p>When working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3081</p><p>The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3082</p><p>You see this in every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is committed to doing things “his way.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and then gets stuck in a rut.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3084</p><p>The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3085</p><p>One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3086</p><p>The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie everything up in being the point guard or the partner at the firm or whatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a health condition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your hands.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3089</p><p>When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle. Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3089</p><p>For most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my identity. After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself. When you spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and that disappears, who are you now?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3091</p><p>Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings. If your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what happens when your period of service ends? For many business owners, their identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.” If you have spent every waking moment working on your business, how will you feel after you sell the company?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3094</p><p>The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes. “I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally tough and loves a physical challenge.” “I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.” “I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and creates things.”</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3100</p><p>When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than brittle. Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the changing circumstances rather than against them.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3102</p><p>The following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas perfectly: Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail.—LAO TZU</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3109</p><p>Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you. A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.</p><p>Notes</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3688</p><p>dopamine . . . plays a central role in many neurological processes: Researchers later discovered that endorphins and opioids were responsible for pleasure responses.

It states that the path followed between any two points will always be the path requiring the least energy. This simple principle underpins the laws of the universe. From this one idea, you can describe the laws of motion and relativity.</li></ul><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4861</p><ul><li>This can derail our decision making as well. The brain overestimates the danger of anything that seems like an immediate threat but has almost no likelihood of actually occurring: your plane crashing during a bit of turbulence, a burglar breaking in while you’re home alone, a terrorist blowing up the bus you’re on. Meanwhile, it underestimates what appears to be a distant threat but is actually very likely: the steady accumulation of fat from eating unhealthy food, the gradual decay of your muscles from sitting at a desk, the slow creep of clutter when you fail to tidy up.</li></ul><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4873</p><ul><li>I have a pet theory about what happens when we achieve a flow state. This isn’t confirmed. It’s just my guess. Psychologists commonly refer to the brain as operating in two modes: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast and instinctual. Generally speaking, processes you can perform very quickly (like habits) are governed by System 1. Meanwhile, System 2 controls thinking processes that are more effortful and slow—like calculating the answer to a difficult math problem. With regard to flow, I like to imagine System 1 and System 2 as residing on opposite ends of the spectrum of thinking. The more automatic a cognitive process is, the more it slides toward the System 1 side of the spectrum. The more effortful a task is, the more it slides toward System 2. Flow, I believe, resides on the razor’s edge between System 1 and System 2. You are fully using all of your automatic and implicit knowledge related to the task while also working hard to rise to a challenge beyond your ability. Both brain modes are fully engaged. The conscious and nonconscious are working perfectly in sync.</li></ul><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4881</p><ul><li>The discovery of variable rewards happened by accident. One day in the lab, the famous Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner was running low on food pellets during one experiment and making more was a time-consuming process because he had to manually press the pellets in a machine. This situation led him to “ask myself why every press of the lever had to be reinforced.” He decided to only give treats to the rats intermittently and, to his surprise, varying the delivery of food did not decrease behavior, but actually increased it.</li></ul><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4885</p><ul><li>I created a template for readers interested in keeping a decision journal.
