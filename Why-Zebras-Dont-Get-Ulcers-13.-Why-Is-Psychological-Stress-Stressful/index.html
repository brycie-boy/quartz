Rats only occasionally use it, but primates are great at it. Put a primate through something unpleasant: it gets a stress-response. Put it through the same stressor while in a room full of other primates and…it depends. If hose primates are strangers, the stress-response gets worse. But if they are friends, the stress-response is decreased. Social support networks—it helps to have a shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold, an ear to listen to you, someone to cradle you and to tell you it will be okay.</p><p>360</p><p>The same is seen with primates in the wild. While I mostly do laboratory research on how stress and glucocorticoids affect the brain, I spend my summers in Kenya studying patterns of stress-related physiology and disease among wild baboons living in a national park. The social life of a male baboon can be pretty stressful—you get beaten up as a victim of displaced aggression; you carefully search for some tuber to eat and clean it off, only to have it stolen by someone of higher rank; and so on. Glucocorticoid levels are elevated among low-ranking baboons and among the entire group if the dominance hierarchy is unstable, or if a new aggressive male has just joined the troop. But if you are a male baboon with a lot of friends, you are likely to have lower glucocorticoid concentrations than males of the same general rank who lack these outlets. And what counts as friends? You play with kids, have frequent nonsexual grooming bouts with females (and social grooming in nonhuman primates lowers blood pressure).</p><hr><p>361</p><p>Social support is certainly protective for humans as well. This can be demonstrated even in transient instances of support. In a number of subtle studies, subjects were exposed to a stressor such as having to give a public speech or perform a mental arithmetic task, or having two strangers argue with them, with or without a supportive friend present. In each case, social support translated into less of a cardiovascular stress-response. Profound and persistent differences in degrees of social support can influence human physiology as well: within the same family, there are significantly higher glucocorticoid levels among stepchildren than among biological children. Or, as another example, among women with metastatic breast cancer, the more social support, the lower the resting cortisol levels.</p><hr><p>362❗️</p><p>As noted in chapter 8, people with spouses or close friends have longer life expectancies. When the spouse dies, the risk of dying rises. Recall also from that chapter the study of parents of Israeli soldiers killed in the Lebanon war: in the aftermath of this stressor, there was no notable increase in risk of diseases or mortality, except among those who were already divorced or widowed. Some additional examples concern the cardiovascular system. People who are socially isolated have overly active sympathetic nervous systems. Given the likelihood that this will lead to higher blood pressure and more platelet aggregation in their blood vessels (remember that from chapter 3?), they are more likely to have heart disease—two to five times as likely, as it turns out. And once they have the heart disease, they are more likely to die at a younger age. In a study of patients with severe coronary heart disease, Redford Williams of Duke University and colleagues found that half of those lacking social support were dead within five years—a rate three times higher than was seen in patients who had a spouse or close friend, after controlling for the severity</p><p>362</p><p>Finally, support can exist at the broad community level (stay tuned for chapter 17). If you are a member of an ethnic minority, the fewer members there are of your group in your neighborhood, the higher your risks of mental illness, psychiatric hospitalization, and suicide.</p><hr><p>363</p><p>Predictability</p><p>Weiss’s rat studies uncovered another variable modulating the stress-response. The rat gets the same pattern of electric shocks, but this time, just before each shock, it hears a warning bell. Fewer ulcers. Predictability makes stressors less stressful. The rat with the warning gets two pieces of information. It learns when something dreadful is about to happen. The rest of the time, it learns that something dreadful is not about to happen. It can relax. The rat without a warning can always be a half-second away from the next shock. In effect, information that increases predictability tells you that there is bad news, but comforts you that it’s not going to be worse—you are going to get shocked soon, but it’s never going to be sprung on you without warning.</p><p>Note: variable reward</p><p>363</p><p>By being given news about the stressor to come, you are also implicitly being comforted by now knowing what stressors are not coming.</p><hr><p>364</p><p>As another variant on the helpfulness of predictability, organisms will eventually habituate to a stressor if it is applied over and over; it may knock physiological allostasis equally out of balance the umpteenth time that it happens, but it is a familiar, predictable stressor by then, and a smaller stress-response is triggered. One classic demonstration involved men in the Norwegian military going through parachute training—as the process went from being hair-raisingly novel to something they could do in their sleep, their anticipatory stress-response went from being gargantuan to nonexistent.</p><hr><p>364</p><p>The power of loss of predictability as a psychological stressor is shown in an elegant, subtle study. A rat is going about its business in its cage, and at measured intervals the experimenter delivers a piece of food down a chute into the cage; rat eats happily. This is called an intermittent reinforcement schedule. Now, change the pattern of food delivery so that the rat gets exactly the same total amount of food over the course of an hour, but at a random rate. The rat receives just as much reward, but less predictably, and up go glucocorticoid levels. There is not a single physically stressful thing going on in the rat’s world. It’s not hungry, pained, running for its life—nothing is out of allostatic balance. In the absence of any stressor, loss of predictability triggers a stress-response.</p><hr><p>365</p><p>There are even circumstances in which a stress-response can be more likely to occur in someone despite the reality that the outside world is less stressful. Work by the zoologist John Wingfield of the University of Washington has shown an example of this with wild birds. Consider some species that migrates between the Arctic and the tropics. Bird #1 is in the Arctic, where the temperature averages 5 degrees and where it is, indeed, 5 degrees outside that day. In contrast, Bird #2 is in the tropics, where the average temperature is 80 degrees, but today it has dropped down to 60. Who has the bigger stress-response? Amazingly, Bird #2. The point isn’t that the temperature in the tropics is 55 degrees warmer than in the Arctic (what kind of stressor would that be?). It’s that the temperature in the tropics is 20 degrees colder than anticipated.</p><p>365</p><p>A human version of the same idea has been documented. During the onset of the Nazi blitzkrieg bombings of England, London was hit every night like clockwork. Lots of stress. In the suburbs the bombings were far more sporadic, occurring perhaps once a week. Fewer stressors, but much less predictability. There was a significant increase in the incidence of ulcers during that time. Who developed more ulcers? The suburban population. (As another measure of the importance of unpredictability, by the third month of the bombing, ulcer rates in all the hospitals had dropped back to normal.)</p><hr><p>366</p><p>Despite the similarity between the responses of humans and of other animals to a lack of predictability, I suspect that there they are not identical, and in an important way. The warning of impending shocks to a rat has little effect on the size of the stress-response during the shocks; instead, allowing the rat to feel more confident about when it doesn’t have to worry reduces the rat’s anticipatory stress-response the rest of the time. Analogously, when the dentist says, “Only two more times and then we’re done,” it allows us to relax at the end of the second burst of drilling. But I suggest, although I cannot prove it, that unlike the case for the rat, proper information will also lower our stress-response during the pain. If you were told “only two times more” versus “only ten times more,” wouldn’t you use different mental strategies to try to cope? With either scenario, you would pull out the comforting thought of “only one more and then it’s the last one” at different times; you would save your most distracting fantasy for a different point; you would try counting to zero from different numbers. Predictive information lets us know what internal coping strategy is likely to work best during a stressor.</p><p>366</p><p>We often wish for information about the course of some medical problem because it aids our strategizing about how we will cope. A simple example: you have some minor surgery, and you’re given predictive information—the first post-surgical day, there is going to be a lot of pain, pretty constant, whereas by the second day, you’ll just feel a bit achy. Armed with that information, you are more likely to plan on watching the eight distracting videos on day one and to devote day two to writing delicate haikus than the other way around. Among other reasons, we wish to optimize our coping strategies when we request the most devastating piece of medical information any of us will ever face: “How much time do I have left?”</p><hr><p>367</p><p>Control Rat studies also demonstrate a related facet of psychological stress. Give the rat the same series of shocks. This time, however, you study a rat that has been trained to press a lever to avoid electric shocks. Take away the lever, shock it, and the rat develops a massive stress-response. It’s as if the rat were thinking, “I can’t believe this. I know what to do about electric shocks; give me a damned lever and I could handle this. This isn’t fair.” Ulceration city (as well as higher glucocorticoid levels, poorer immune function, and faster tumor growth). Give the trained rat a lever to press; even if it is disconnected from the shock mechanism, it still helps: down goes the stress-response. So long as the rat has been exposed to a higher rate of shocks previously, it will think that the lower rate now is due to its having control over the situation. This is an extraordinarily powerful variable in modulating the stress-response.</p><p>367</p><p>The identical style of experiment with humans yields similar results. Place two people in adjoining rooms, and expose both to intermittent noxious, loud noises; the person who has a button and believes that pressing it decreases the likelihood of more noise is less hypertensive. In one variant on this experiment, subjects with the button who did not bother to press it did just as well as those who actually pressed the button. Thus, the exercise of control is not critical; rather, it is the belief that you have it. An everyday example: airplanes are safer than cars, yet more of us are phobic about flying. Why? Because your average driver believes that he is a better-than-average driver, thus more in control. In an airplane, we have no control at all. My wife and I tease each other on plane flights, exchanging control: “Okay, you rest for a while, I’ll take over concentrating on keeping the pilot from having a stroke.”</p><hr><p>368</p><p>occupational stress is built more around lack of control, work life spent as a piece of the machine. Endless studies have shown that the link between occupational stress and increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is anchored in the killer combination of high demand and low control—you have to work hard, a lot is expected of you, and you have minimal control over the process. This is the epitome of the assembly line, the combination of stressors that makes for Marx’s alienation of the workers. The control element is more powerful than the demand one—low demand and low control is more damaging to one’s health than high demand and high control.</p><p>369</p><p>The stressfulness of lack of control on the job applies in only certain domains, however. For example, there is the issue of what product is made, and lack of control in this realm tends not to be all that stressful—few people are ulcerating because of their deep conviction that all of their capable and motivated fellow workers should be cranking vast numbers of stuffed Snoopys out of this factory instead of ball bearings. Instead, it is stress about lack of control over the process—what work rate is expected and how much flexibility there is about it, what amenities there are and how much control you have over them, how authoritarian the authorities are.</p><p>369</p><p>These issues can apply just as readily to some less expected workplaces, ones that can be highly prestigious and desirable. For example, professional musicians in orchestras generally have lower job satisfaction and more stress than those in small chamber groups (such as a string quartet). Why? One pair of researchers suggest that this is because of the lack of autonomy in an orchestra, where centuries of tradition hold that orchestras are subservient to the dictatorial whims of the maestro conducting them. For example, it was only in recent years that orchestra unions won the right for regularly scheduled bathroom breaks during rehearsals, instead of having to wait until the conductor cared to note how squirmy the reed players had become.*</p><hr><p>369</p><p>So the variable of control is extremely important; controlling the rewards that you get can be more desirable than getting them for nothing. As an extraordinary example, both pigeons and rats prefer to press a lever in order to obtain food (so long as the task is not too difficult) over having the food delivered freely—a theme found in the activities and statements of many scions of great fortunes, who regret the contingency-free nature of their lives, without purpose or striving.</p><hr><p>370</p><p>Loss of control and lack of predictive information are closely related. Some researchers have emphasized this, pointing out that the common theme is that the organism is subjected to novelty. You thought you knew how to manage things, you thought you knew what would happen next, and it turns out you are wrong in this novel situation. The potency of this is demonstrated in primate studies in which merely placing the animal into a novel cage suppresses its immune system. Others have emphasized that these types of stressors cause arousal and vigilance, as you search for the new rules of control and prediction. Both views are different aspects of the same issue.</p><hr><a href=#notes><h3 id=notes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Notes</h3></a><ul><li><a
