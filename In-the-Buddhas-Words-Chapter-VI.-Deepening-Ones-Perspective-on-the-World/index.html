A blissful heavenly rebirth, however, is not the final purpose for which the Buddha taught the Dhamma. At best it is only a temporary waystation. The ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering, and the bliss of the heavens, no matter how blissful, is not the same as the cessation of suffering.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3214
all states of existence within the round of rebirths, even the heavens, are transient, unreliable, bound up with pain. Thus the ultimate aim of the Dhamma is nothing short of liberation, which means total release from the round of birth and death.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3216
What lies beyond the round of rebirths is an unconditioned state called Nibbāna.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3808
when he has completed the entire lifespan of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, and to the domain of spirits. But the Blessed One’s disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire lifespan of those devas, he attains final Nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the difference, the disparity, the distinction between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, with regard to destination and rebirth.
(AN 4:125; II 128–29)</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3216
Nibbāna transcends the conditioned world, yet it can be attained within conditioned existence, in this very life, and experienced as the extinction of suffering.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3218
The realization of Nibbāna comes with the blossoming of wisdom and brings perfect peace, untarnished happiness, and the stilling of the mind’s compulsive drives.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3219
Nibbāna is the destruction of thirst, the thirst of craving.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3221
To guide his spiritually mature disciples toward Nibbāna, the Buddha had to steer them beyond the blissful rewards that could be won in a future life by performing wholesome deeds. He did so through the “supramundane” facets of his teaching, those aspects designed to lead disciples beyond the “triple world” of sense-sphere existence, form-sphere existence, and formless existence.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3253
To follow the Buddha in the direction he wants to lead us, we have to learn to see beneath the surface glitter of pleasure, position, and power that usually enthralls us, and at the same time, to learn to see through the deceptive distortions of perception, thought, and views that habitually cloak our vision.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3255
Ordinarily, we represent things to ourselves through the refractory prism of subjective biases. These biases are shaped by our craving and attachments, which they in turn reinforce. We see things that we want to see; we blot out things that threaten or disturb us, that shake our complacency, that throw into question our comforting assumptions about ourselves and our lives. To undo this process involves a commitment to truth that is often unsettling, but in the long run proves exhilarating and liberating.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3259
To help us transform our understanding and deepen our perspective on the world, he offers us three standpoints from which we can appraise the values by which we order our lives. These three standpoints also represent three “moments” or steps in an unfolding process of insight that starts from our common-sense attitudes and moves strategically toward higher knowledge, enlightenment, and release.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3262
The three moments are: gratification (ass̄da), danger (ādīnava), and escape (nissarạa).</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3267
one begins by recognizing the indubitable fact that such worldly phenomena as sense objects, forms, and feelings give us some degree of gratification. This gratification consists in the pleasure and joy (sukha-somanassa) we experience when we succeed in fulfilling our desires. Once we acknowledge this fact, we can then probe deeper by asking whether such pleasure and joy are entirely satisfactory.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
‘Whatever pleasure and joy there is in the world, this is the gratification in the world
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3270
If we address this question with utter honesty, in a dispassionate frame of mind, we will realize that such pleasure and joy are far from satisfactory. To the contrary, they are saddled with drawbacks and defects ranging from the trifling to the catastrophic, defects that we perpetually hide from ourselves so that we can continue unhindered in our quest for gratification. This is their danger, the second moment or step of observation.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3273
The most pervasive danger lurking behind the innocent façade of our worldly pleasures is their inherent nature of being impermanent (anicca), bound up with suffering and discontent (dukkha), and subject to inevitable change and decay (vipariṇāmadhamma).</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
that the world is impermanent, bound up with suffering, and subject to change, this is the danger in the world
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3275
The third moment, the moment of escape,</p></li><li><p>Highlight - Location 3276
“Escape” here is not escapism, a word that implies an anxious attempt to avoid facing one’s problems by pretending they don’t exist and losing oneself in distractions. True escape is quite the opposite:</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3279
Once we see that the objects of our attachment are flawed, beset with hidden dangers, we then realize that the way of escape lies in dropping our attachment to them.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3366
the removal and abandoning of desire and lust for the world, this is the escape from the world.’
(AN 3:101 §§1–2; I 258–59)</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3286
three major objects of attachment: sensual pleasures, bodily form, and feelings.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3287
It begins with a close-up view of the tribulations that a “clansman”—a young householder pursuing the ancient Indian counterpart of a professional career—might undergo in his quest for sensual gratification.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3411
the danger in the case of sensual pleasures?
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3412
Here, monks, on account of the craft by which a clansman makes a living—whether checking, accounting, calculating, farming, trading, husbandry, archery, the royal service, or whatever craft it may be—he has to face cold and heat; he is injured by contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and creeping things; he risks death by hunger and thirst. Now this is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life,
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3416
“If no property comes to the clansman while he works and strives and makes an effort thus, he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: ‘My work is in vain, my effort is fruitless!’ Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life,
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3419
“If property comes to the clansman while he works and strives and makes an effort thus, he experiences pain and grief in protecting it:
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3421
as he guards and protects his property, kings or thieves make off with it, or fire burns it, or water sweeps it away, or unloved heirs make off with it. And he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: ‘I no longer have my property!’ Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of 8suffering visible in this present life
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3288
the scope of the examination widens from the personal to the collective, encompassing the broader social and political consequences of this quest. It reaches its climax in striking images of the warfare and human devastation that follow from the frenzied mass drive for sensual gratification.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3425
“Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause &mldr; kings quarrel with kings, khattiyas with khattiyas, brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders; mother quarrels with son, son with mother, father with son, son with father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, friend with friend. And here in their quarrels, brawls, and disputes they attack each other with fists, clods, sticks, or knives, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life,
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3438
“Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause &mldr; men break into houses, plunder wealth, commit burglary, ambush highways, seduce others’ wives, and when they are caught, kings have many kinds of torture inflicted on them &mldr; whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible in this present life,
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3441
“Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause &mldr; people indulge in misconduct of body, speech, and mind. Having done so, on the breakup of the body, after death, they are reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. Now this is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering in the life to come,
(MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta; I 84–90)</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3318
Craving for sensual pleasures is one trap that keeps beings bound to the round of rebirths. Another major trap is attachment to views.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3320
The most dangerous of wrong views are those that deny or undermine the foundations of ethics.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3321
a number of perils posed by this type of wrong view; prominent among them is rebirth in the lower realms. Views also lead to one-sided, biased interpretations of reality that we cling to as accurate and complete.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3323
People who cling tenaciously to their own views of a particular situation often come into conflict with those who view the same situation in a different light. Views thus give rise to conflicts and disputes.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3325

Now at that time a number of ascetics and brahmins,
(Ud 6:4; 67–69)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3774
held various views, beliefs, and opinions, and propagated various views. And they were quarrelsome, disputatious, wrangling, wounding each other with verbal darts, saying, “The Dhamma is like this, the Dhamma is not like that!
(Ud 6:4; 67–69)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3780
“Formerly, monks, there was a king in Sāvatthī who addressed a man and asked him to round up all the persons in the city who were blind from birth. When the man had done so, the king asked the man to show the blind men an elephant. To some of the blind men he presented the head of the elephant, to some the ear, to others a tusk, the trunk, the body, a foot, the hindquarters, the tail, or the tuft at the end of the tail. And to each one he said, ‘This is an elephant.’
(Ud 6:4; 67–69)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3783
“When he reported to the king what he had done, the king went to the blind men and asked them, ‘Tell me, blind men, what is an elephant like?’
(Ud 6:4; 67–69)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3785
“Those who had been shown the head of the elephant replied, ‘An elephant, your majesty, is just like a water jar.’ Those who had been shown the ear replied, ‘An elephant is just like a winnowing basket.’ Those who had been shown the tusk replied, ‘An elephant is just like a plowshare.’ Those who had been shown the trunk replied, ‘An elephant is just like a plow pole.’ Those who had been shown the body replied, ‘An elephant is just like a storeroom.’ And each of the others likewise described the elephant in terms of the part they had been shown.
(Ud 6:4; 67–69)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3789
“Then, saying, ‘An elephant is like this, an elephant is not like that! An elephant is not like this, an elephant is like that!’ they fought each other with their fists. And the king was delighted. Even so, monks, are the wanderers of other sects blind and sightless, and thus they become quarrelsome, disputatious, and wrangling, wounding each other with verbal darts.”

To show the danger in “feeling,” the Buddha selects the feelings of a meditating monk in the jhānas, the meditative absorptions, the most refined mundane experiences of pleasure and peace.

“Suppose, Māgandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterizing his body over a burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The physician would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy, independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes.

What do you think, Māgandiya? Would that man envy that leper for his burning charcoal pit or his use of medicine?” “No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because when there is sickness, there is need for medicine, and when there is no sickness there is no need for medicine.”

a particular problem posed by eternalist views. Such views can inspire meditators to attain states of deep meditative bliss, which they interpret as union with a divine reality or realization of an eternal self. From the perspective of the Buddha’s teaching, however, such attainments merely create the karmic potential for rebirth into a realm in which that meditative experience becomes the fundamental condition of consciousness. In other words, the attainment of these states in the human realm generates rebirth into the corresponding planes in the realm of subtle form or the formless realm.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3338
The text cited here shows that certain meditators attain the four “divine abodes” and take rebirth in the corresponding planes of the brahma world, where they might abide even for as long as five hundred great eons. Eventually, however, they must inevitably pass away and may then fall into the unfortunate realms of rebirth.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3341

when he has completed the entire lifespan of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, and to the domain of spirits. But the Blessed One’s disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire lifespan of those devas, he attains final Nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the difference, the disparity, the distinction between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, with regard to destination and rebirth.
