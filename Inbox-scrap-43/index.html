It&rsquo;s easy to imagine everything in the universe lumped together into one big something beyond which there is nothing. But it&rsquo;s the concept of nothing that sends our primate minds into a tailspin. Now, the very young Chicken Qabalist might be tempted to think of this divine nothingness as kind of a negative ‚ÄúenO‚Äù from which the ‚ÄúOne‚Äù somehow popped into being as if from behind a mysterious looking-glass. But, as the Second Command-Rant will demonstrate, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù is ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù altogether.</p><p>30</p><p>Second Command-Rant</p><p>The First Command-Rant is a lie. All is Nothing.</p><p>30</p><p>Astronomers and physicists tell us there is more nothing in the universe than anything else. In fact, they now say that most of the matter and energy in the cosmos (well over 90 percent) is somehow hiding in all this nothingness. Come to think about it, even matter that we can see is really mostly nothing. There is infinitely more nothing in an atom than protons and electrons. There is more nothing in our bodies than anything else. We are full of tubes and pockets and sacs and bladders and cavities and chambers and openings and voids. Every cell in your body is mostly nothing. When a cell starts to divide to produce more cells, it first folds in on itself to create more precious nothing to work with. Even your brain grew out of the nothingness of this embryonic internal disappearing act.</p><p>31</p><p>Physicists cannot even say with any certainty that matter, as most people think of it, exists at all. The components of atoms (protons, neutrons, electrons, quarks, charm, etc.) are not matter. They are tendencies. (Tell that to your head the next time you slam it getting into your car!) Physicists and mystics are now using the same vocabulary, and it is only a matter of time before our learned men and women of science will announce clearly what Qabalists have been saying cryptically for centuries.</p><p>31</p><p>Elements of creation as we know them‚Äîminerals and metals, animals and people, planets and stars, light and energy‚Äîare merely the husks of an invisible universal force that sustains the entire cosmos. We&rsquo;re like dead skin cells that have flaked off from the body of the unmanifest Super-Being. This force‚Äîthis nothingness, is better than reality. It is undiluted, unlimited potentiality! It is the ultimate reality, and the nature of that reality is pure consciousness.</p><p>31</p><p>The first thing that attracted me to the Qabalah as a young Chicken Qabalist (hatchling) was the concept that everything proceeded out of this ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù That made Nothing the ultimate creator, not the Elohim,1 or Jehovah, or any of the other ill-tempered bullies of the Old Testament. I liked the idea of brooding and inscrutable Nothing behind everything in the universe.</p><p>31</p><p>You can think about the Elohim creating stuff like crazy; you can think about YHVH Elohim2 blowing life into Adam&rsquo;s nose; you can even think about a sneaky stinky cloud killing the first-born babies in ancient Egypt; but you can&rsquo;t think about Nothing! Anything you can think about ‚Äîanything you can capture and hold in your mind&rsquo;s eye‚Äîis automatically disqualified from infinityhood and can&rsquo;t possibly be the ultimate Deity.</p><p>32</p><p>Qabalistic tradition informs us that everything proceeded from the Great One, and the Great One proceeded from a very special kind of Nothing‚Äîactually three very special kinds of Nothing. Beginning Chicken Qabalists need not spend a great deal of time trying to grasp this concept because, first, it can&rsquo;t be understood, and second, if you did understand it, there would no longer be a need for you to study anything. However, as you approach the meditative summit of your career as a Chicken Qabalist, the irrational mystery of the three kinds of Nothing will increasingly absorb you. For this reason I offer the following.</p><p>32</p><p>The first kind of Nothing is called Ain 3 This Nothing is really nothing‚Äînot even the concept of no-thing (i.e., the absence of anything). Now, if Ain just sat around nowhere doing nothing it&rsquo;s a sure bet that nothing was going to get done. However, something happened to make Ain actually become Nothing (maybe because it was Nothing all along and just had to wake up to the fact). This new, defined Nothing the Qabalists call Limitless Nothing, or Ain Soph . The third kind of Nothing is a hybrid Ain Soph called Ain Soph Aur, , Limitless Light. I view it as the light bulb that goes off in the vastness of Ain Soph when it realizes the perfect Notness of its Nothingness! Nothing is Not! This double negative is tantamount to saying ‚ÄúSomething is!‚Äù and sets the stage for the first Positive in the universe‚Äîthe concept of One.4</p><p>32</p><p>Don&rsquo;t worry if none of this makes any sense to you right now. It is enough to remember that realization of ‚ÄúOne‚Äù is the second-to-last goal of all Qabalists. The final goal is to attain the consciousness of ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù</p><p>32</p><p>Third Command-Rant</p><p>There really isn&rsquo;t a creation, time or space, Heaven or Earth‚Ä¶</p><p>32</p><p>Get used to it. Ultimate reality is Nothing, so all perceivable phenomena, including time and space, are illusions. We could take a picture proving this if our camera had a wide enough lens. That lens, of course, would have to take in not only the absolute One, but all that Nothing, too!</p><p>33</p><p>Third Command-Rant (continued)</p><p>‚Ä¶But there is a you!</p><p>33</p><p>On the other hand, you are real5‚Äîa sparkling image of the absolute reality. You must remember, however, that the real you is something far different and more wonderful than your ape-like brain and reptilian nervous system can grasp. The real you is not just a piece of the force of universal consciousness‚Äîthe real you is, in essence, the universal consciousness itself! You are not your body, or your brain, or your mind, or your astral body, or any of the more subtle sheathes that yogis and spoon-benders say you are nestled inside. Bodies and brains and minds are as unreal as creation, time, space, Heaven or Earth. The real you doesn&rsquo;t eat, or drink, or think, or sleep, or die. I&rsquo;m sure we would all be amazed to know just how skinny, and light, and thoughtless, and sleepless, and immortal we really are.</p><p>33</p><p>fourth Command-Rant</p><p>We perceive there is a creation, time and space, Heaven, and Earth because of a fundamental defect in our powers of perception.</p><p>33</p><p>Our eyes cannot see infrared or ultraviolet; our ears cannot hear a dog-whistle or the extra-low frequencies generated by giant redwood trees; most people&rsquo;s noses can&rsquo;t even smell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. Even if we could utilize all the sensitive new scientific instruments that enable us to see more, hear more, or smell more, do we really think that we could ever gather enough information (or develop powers of intelligence profound enough to interpret that information) to unveil the ultimate reality? Get real! We are all sleepwalkers stumbling blind, deaf, and numb through a life we could never understand even if we could see, hear, feel, or smell like Superman.</p><p>33</p><p>It is perfectly natural for you to ask, ‚ÄúWhy is there evil in the world?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy do bad things happen to good people?‚Äù but stop flattering yourself. You&rsquo;re never going to find an answer to those questions by gathering information with your senses and attempting to process that information with your brain.</p><p>33</p><p>Fifth Command-Rant</p><p>This defect cannot be repaired, but it can be overcome.</p><p>34</p><p>Caution: Most people will be happier if they never try to overcome this defect. That is why most people in the world find it so easy to believe the most outrageous religious concepts without batting an eyelash. The rest of us brave and foolish souls must consciously misuse our defective powers of perception to our advantage. This is done by Qabalistic study and thought.</p><p>34</p><p>Six Command-Rant</p><p>In order to overcome our defective powers of perception we must be willing to abuse them until they break.</p><p>34</p><p>Qabalistic study and thought is designed to make you crazier than most people by requiring that you attain the all-encompassing consciousness of the real you. Obviously, this is not easy to achieve, but you may as well bite the bullet and get to work because it is the ultimate fate of all units of evolving consciousness‚Äîeven Chicken Qabalists!</p><p>34</p><p>In order to hit this mystical and omniscient mark, it will be necessary for you to partially disable the mechanisms of normal thought by overloading your laughably inadequate mind with data from your laughably inadequate powers of perception. If all goes well, you will become so sick of the whole ponderous cosmos that your inadequate faculties will look for any way out of the insanity and eventually surrender to transcendent consciousness.6</p><p>34</p><p>The first step is easy. All you have to do is join 99 percent of the world&rsquo;s population and accept creation/time/space/Heaven/Earth as ‚Äúreality.‚Äù Then, through Qabalistic exercises, you systematically dissect and analyze every aspect of that ‚Äúreality.‚Äù You connect everything you can think of with everything else you can think of until there is no ‚Äúanything‚Äù left.</p><p>34</p><p>This process is not as tedious as it may at first appear because the illusionary universe obligingly provides us with three very helpful Command-Rants of its own.</p><p>‚ô¶ Everything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth.</p><p>‚ô¶ Everything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven and Earth.</p><p>‚ô¶ Everything in Heaven and Earth contains the pattern of everything in Heaven and Earth.</p><p>35</p><p>Seventh Command-Rant</p><p>Everything in Heaven and Earth is connected to everything in Heaven and Earth.</p><p>35</p><p>This one&rsquo;s easy. We are living in a wall-to-wall universe. Everything is connected to everything else. The lox on the cream cheese rests upon the bagel; which is connected to my fingers; which are connected to my hand; which is connected (via the rest of my body) to my foot; which is connected to my shoe; which is connected to the floor; which is part of the delicatessen; which rests upon Earth; which is spinning in space; which also contains and is connected to the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and all the other heavenly bodies in the universe.</p><p>35</p><p>It follows, then, that all lox is ultimately connected to all cream cheese, bagels, fingers, hands, feet, shoes, floors, delicatessens, planets, Sun, Moon, stars and heavenly bodies everywhere. It also follows that each unit of lox possesses a special affinity with every other unit of lox by virtue of its vibratory ‚Äúloxness,‚Äù and by the fact that they are all indirectly connected. Naturally, the same can be said for all cream cheese, bagels, body parts, and extraterrestrial delicatessens.</p><p>35</p><p>Eightth Command-Rant</p><p>Everything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven and Earth.</p><p>35</p><p>A piano has 88 keys, but theoretically we could build a piano with an infinite number of keys stretching forever lower in one direction and forever higher in the other. But no matter how big we make our piano, we will never have more than twelve notes with which to play. We can draw similar parallels in the characteristics of light and color, and the behavior of organic and mineral life.</p><p>35</p><p>In the subatomic realm, electrons orbit the nucleus of the atom in the same way moons orbit their planets, and planets orbit stars, and solar systems orbit whatever inscrutable ‚Äúthing‚Äù is at the center of their galaxies, etc.</p><p>36</p><p>Look around. You are smack dab in the middle of a ribbon of repeating patterns stretching infinitely toward macrocosmic immensity in one direction, and infinitely toward microcosmic smallness in the other. As above, so below. If we study the tiny subject, we simultaneously study its giant counterpart and vice versa.</p><p>36</p><p>Nineth Command-Rant</p><p>Everything in Heaven and Earth contains the pattern of everything in Heaven and Earth.</p><p>36</p><p>This Command-Rant is really an extension of the previous one. As everything in Heaven and Earth is the reflection of everything in Heaven and Earth, every reflectee houses a faithful blueprint of that which it reflects. Since prehistoric times, this was observable in flora and fauna, but now we are magically blessed with the wondrous knowledge of DNA. Not only does everything in Heaven and Earth contain the pattern of everything in Heaven and Earth, everything is first cousin to everything in Heaven and Earth!</p><p>36</p><p>Tenth Command-rant</p><p>Look hard enough at anything and you will eventually see everything.</p><p>36</p><p>Only then, dear Chicken Qabalist, will you have an eye big enough to really close‚Ä¶so you can finally get some well-deserved rest.</p><p>37</p><p>3</p><p>THE SEPHER YETZIRAH</p><p>37</p><p>Introduced by Lon Milo DuQuette</p><p>What happened to Jehovah? Isn&rsquo;t Jehovah God?<br>Didn&rsquo;t Jehovah create Heaven and Earth? Hell no!<br>Elohim did, and Elohim is a very peculiar word.</p><p>‚ÄîRABBI LAMED BEN CLIFFORD</p><p>38</p><p>And said the Elohim, Let there be light: and there was light.</p><p>‚ÄîGenesis 1 :3</p><p>I&rsquo;M SURE MANY OF YOU students are asking yourselves why I am starting our study of Genesis with the third verse of chapter 1 instead of the first. The answer is simple. Verse 1 tells us squat! It informs us; ‚ÄúIn the beginning the Elohim created Heaven and Earth.‚Äù3</p><p>Big deal! What the hell is an Elohim? Is it God? Translators of the English Bible seem to think so. Most versions read: ‚ÄúIn the beginning God created Heaven and Earth.‚Äù</p><p>What happened to Jehovah? Isn&rsquo;t Jehovah God? Didn&rsquo;t Jehovah create Heaven and Earth? Hell no! Elohim did, and Elohim is a very peculiar word.</p><p>El ()4 is the root word for Deity. Eloh () is a feminine singular, in other words, a female Deity (a Goddess); im () is the plural ending for things that are masculine. Elohim (), then, should be translated either ‚ÄúGods and Goddesses‚Äù or ‚ÄúDual-Gendered Deity.‚Äù Later on in verses 26 and 27 the Elohim even refer to themselves as plural, ‚ÄúAnd said the Elohim, Let us make Adam in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth. And created the Elohim Adam in the image of Elohim created they them, male and female created they them.‚Äù</p><p>Surprised? So was everyone who had their hearts set on God not having a vagina and everyone who believed that Adam was an historical character, like General Custer, and not just a name for the human race. They were so upset when they discovered that in the beginning the Dual-Gendered Deity created Heaven and Earth that they made sure that Elohim and innumerable other special names would be translated ‚ÄúGod‚Äù or ‚ÄúLord‚Äù or ‚ÄúLord God‚Äù or other such ambiguous masculine-sounding names.5</p><p>161</p><p>3 The Biblical translations here are obviously those of the Rabbi himself, who worked from the standard Hebrew texts.</p><p>162</p><p>5 It might surprise you to know that traditionally the concept of God as a father is foreign to the ancient Jewish mind. Abraham was the father of the Jews, and the father figure to the Jews. In the Bible, Abraham never referred to God as father, neither did Noah, Moses, Elijah, Elias, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Amos, Jonah, Solomon, Ezra, or Nehemiah. In fact, in the entire Old Testament only two verses in the book of Isaiah and one Psalm of David make reference to the fatherlike qualities of Deity.</p><p>39</p><p>Besides this little titbit, verse 1 leaves us in the dark concerning what Heaven is, what Earth is, or how the Elohim went about creating these things. Verse 2 is even worse:</p><p>And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters.</p><p>If Earth was void and formless, where was all this water coming from? If the author was trying to be inscrutable, he sure did a damned good job of it.</p><p>Verse 3 finally gives us something we can dig our teeth into:</p><p>And the Elohim said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p><p>The key word here is ‚Äúsaid.‚Äù That&rsquo;s how everything was created‚Äîthe Elohim talked everything into existence.6 The Elohim said it, and it was so. Obviously words are very important in the grand creation scenario. A word is a vibration, and vibration creates and sustains the universe. The atomic weight of the chemical elements is just another way of measuring their vibration. Molecules hold themselves together and bond with other molecules by the ‚Äúglue‚Äù of their compatible vibrations. That&rsquo;s what is meant by the term ‚Äúthe creative Logos, or Word.‚Äù That&rsquo;s what John7 was talking about when he wrote, ‚ÄúIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.‚Äù Duh!</p><p>And what, my sleepy students, are words made up of? Letters! Our Hebrew alphabet (and what other alphabet would the Elohim dare use?) is made up of 22 sacred letters, and the story of their creation is not found in the Bible, but in a mysterious little masterpiece called the Sepher Yetzirah: The Book of Formation.</p><p>162</p><p>6 Qabalists are quick to point out that because the phrase , ‚Äúand God said‚Äù (literally ‚Äúand said Elohim‚Äù) appears ten times in the first chapter of Genesis, that the number I 0 is the key number of creation.</p><p>162</p><p>7 The Gospel According to Saint John, 1:1.</p><p>40</p><p>Sepher Yetzirah The Book of Information</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>41</p><p>Deity, whom we call Yah, Yea-man, Jehovah of hosts, Joe Heavy, What-It-Is, the Big Kahuna, the Mighty Duh, the living Elohim, King of the Universe, Omnipotent, All-King and Merciful, Supreme, and Extolled is all-powerful, eternal; who is really, really holy and very, very large; who is so big It is both King and Queen of the Universe, who is so all-encompassing and huge that It has nowhere to sit down because all the chairs are inside of Itself; who, because It is everywhere and nowhere, everything and nothing, had no one to play with‚Äîthis Dude of Dudes created the Universe (with the help of three imaginary friends, ‚ÄúNumbers, Letters, and Words‚Äù) in 32 Mysterious Paths of Wisdom. They consist of I 0 Sephiroth out of nothing and of 22 Letters.</p><p>The Deity divided the 22 Letters into three divisions: Three Mothers (fundamental letters), Seven Double letters, and Twelve Simple letters.</p><p>41</p><p>THE 10 SEPHIROTH OUT OF NOTHING</p><p>41</p><p>Ten of these paths came out of nothing. (Because the Deity is everything, It had lots of nothing to play with.) These ten paths are called Sephiroth or emanations. Because they came out of nothing they aren&rsquo;t actually real. (But then, of course, only the Deity knows that for sure.)</p><p>The 10 Sephiroth out of nothing are reflected in the human body by our ten fingers and toes, five on each side. In between the two sets of fingers is the tongue, and in between the two sets of toes are the naughty bits that make humans creative beings, too‚Äîjust like the Deity!</p><p>Ten are the Sephiroth not 9; 10 and not 11 or 12, or 6 %. Think about that for a while. Inquire into it. Put it in your pipe and smoke it. Ponder it while the music from ‚ÄúJeopardy‚Äù plays, and roll it around in your mouth a little before swallowing. Render it evident and lead the Creator back to Its throne so we can all go home.</p><p>But‚Äîat the same time, don&rsquo;t talk about it. Don&rsquo;t even think about it. If your mouth urges you to speak, burn its roof with hot pizza! If your heart urges you to think about it, turn on the television! As it is written, ‚ÄúYour answer must be in the form of a question.‚Äù</p><p>42</p><p>Then 10 Sephiroth out of nothing are infinite in ten ways (I&rsquo;ll put them in Tree of Life order):</p><ol><li><p>Beginning Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>Good Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>End Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>Height Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>Evil Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>Depth Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>West Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>East Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>North Infinite¬†</p></li><li><p>South Infinite¬†</p></li></ol><p>Then 10 Sephiroth out of nothing appear like a lightning flash. Being endless, the Deity&rsquo;s word is in them when they go and return. They run like hell when the Deity orders them around, and are constantly groveling before the throne.</p><p>From the Spirit of the Living God (1) emanated Air (2), from the Air emanated Water (3), from the Water emanated Fire √Üther (4), from the √Üther emanated the Height (5), and the Depth (6), the East (7), and the West (8), the North (9), and the South (10).</p><p>44</p><p>THE 22 LETTERS</p><p>44</p><p>The remaining twenty-two paths are the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. They form the foundation of everything we can think of, and all the other things that will never occur to us. The Deity weighed them and measured them, poked them and prodded them, issued them numbers, stapled and two-hole punched them; stamped their passports and organized them, according to all the crazy sounds It could make with Its infinite and eternal mouth. Formed by the breath of Air, It fixed them on five places in the mouth: the Throat, the Palate, the Tongue, the Teeth, and the Lips.</p><p>The Deity divided the 22 letters into three divisions: Three Mothers or Fundamental Letters, Seven Doubles, and Twelve Simple Consonants.</p><p>44</p><p>THE THREE MOTHERS</p><p>44</p><p>Three are the Fundamental Letters. Three not four, not sixteen, not even 3.14159. Think about that real hard. Turn it over in your mind. Put it in the blender and hit puree. Render it evident and put a fresh battery in the pacemaker of the Most High.</p><p>The Three Fundamental Letters ‚Äî‚Äî(Aleph, Mem, Shin) are real Mothers and are extremely cool. Deity took their temperatures and tissue samples, and measured their cholesterol levels, issued them numbers, certified them, and formed by them lots of things, such as the breast, body, and head, and Heaven, Earth, and the atmosphere, and heat, cold, and moistness‚Äîbut who cares about that stuff!</p><p>First and foremost, they represent the Three Primitive Elements in the universe and the spheres of consciousness those elements represent‚ÄîAir ( Aleph), Water ( Mem), and Fire ( Shin).8</p><p>The Three Fundamental Letters‚Äî‚Äî(Aleph, Mem, Shin) are also the Three Famous Dimensional Twins who, because of their amazing ability to stretch themselves to infinity, create the cosmic elbow room in which the entire universe manifests. Their names are: Aleph‚ÄîUpdown, Mem‚ÄîEastwest, and Shin‚ÄîNorthsouth. Dost thou get this? Needest thou a picture? Then behold figure 3.</p><p>45</p><p>The Double Letters are 7. Seven not 8, not 6 or F10. Hoist them up your flagpole. Clear your palate with them. Spay or neuter them, and spring for the Creator&rsquo;s bail.</p><p>The 7 Double Letters‚Äî ‚Äî(Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Peh, Resh, Tau) are rather confused and can be pronounced in a hard way and in a soft way. Because they can&rsquo;t make up their minds, they symbolize seven opposites: Life-Death, Peace-War, Wisdom-Folly, Wealth-Poverty, Beauty-Ugliness, Fruitfulness-Sterility, and Dominion-Slavery.</p><p>The 7 Double Letters also stand for the six dimensions (that were created when the Three Famous Dimensional Twins did their act and stretched themselves out). Beth for Above, Gimel for Below, Daleth for East, Kaph for West, Peh for North, Resh for South, and the hardworking Tau stands in the center and holds the whole thing together. Wilt thou need us to draw you another picture? Lookest to figure 4 (page 34).</p><p>45</p><p>The 7 Double Letters also stand for lots of other things, such as days of the week, and nostril holes, and other body openings. But who cares about that stuff! First and foremost, they represent the seven planets in the solar system, and the spheres of consciousness those planets represent: Beth for Mercury, Gimel for the Moon, Daleth for Venus, Kaph for Jupiter, Peh for Mars, Resh for the Sun, and Tau for Saturn.9</p><p>45</p><p>THE TWELVE SIMPLE LETTERS</p><p>46</p><p>Twelve are the Simple Letters. Twelve not 11, not‚Äîoh, you get the picture. Send out a memo. Brush and floss. Shampoo and fluff dry them, and rewrite the Creator&rsquo;s permanent record.</p><p>The twelve Simple Letters‚Äî‚Äî(Heh, Vau, Zain, Cheth, Teth, Yod, Lamed, Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi, and Qoph) are attributed to the oblique points, or edges, that were created when the six dimensions (that were created when the Three Famous Dimensional Twins did their act) were sealed and ran into each other at right angles: Heh, North East; Vau, South East; Zain, East Above; Cheth, East Below; Teth, North Above; Yod, North Below; Lamed, North West; Nun, South West; Samekh, West Above; Ayin, West Below; Tzaddi, South Above; Qoph, South Below. Art thou following this? Wilt thou need another picture? See thou figure 5.</p><p>The Twelve Simple Letters also stand for lots of other things, such as months of the year, eggs in a carton, organs in the human body‚Äîbut who cares!</p><p>First and foremost they represent the twelve constellations‚Äîthe twelve signs of the zodiac‚Äîand the spheres of consciousness those twelve signs represent: Heh, Aries; Vau, Taurus; Zain, Gemini; Cheth, Cancer; Teth, Leo; &rsquo; Yod, Virgo; Lamed, Libra; Nun, Scorpio; Samekh, Sagittarius; Ayin, Capricorn; Tzaddi, Aquarius; Qoph, Pisces.</p><p>47</p><p>4</p><p>THE HEBREW ALPHABET</p><p>47</p><p>There&rsquo;s no escaping it. Even the laziest Chicken Qabalist needs to learn the Hebrew alphabet and at least some of its traditional correspondences.4</p><p>47</p><p>Another thing that is absolutely necessary for your study is a small basic library of reference works. You don&rsquo;t have to have these books right now, but you will want them very soon. Of course you will collect more books as you descend into Qabalistic madness, but these texts (and this book, of course) will be enough to get you on the road:</p><p>Aleister Crowley, 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings (York Beach, ME: Samuel Weiser 1990);</p><p>David Godwin, Godwin&rsquo;s Cabalistic Encyclopedia (St. Paul: Llewellyn, 1994);</p><p>Ehud Ben Yehuda, Ben-Yehuda&rsquo;s Pocket English-Hebrew Hebrew-English Dictionary (New York: Pocket Books, 1991).</p><p>48</p><p>The stunning exception is found in his comments on the letter Yod. I strongly urge the reader to carefully read and re-read that section. In 210 words, Ben Clifford casually reveals the supreme symbolic secret of creation by drawing our attention to that most mysterious of natural numbers known to mathematicians as the Greek letter Phi, and to architects as the Golden Mean or Golden Section. This number, or ratio (1.6180339887499), like the irrational number Pi, seems to issue from, and set the pattern for, the basic structure of the entire cosmos. But, unlike other abstract numbers, the pattern set by Phi is revealed naturally and universally in all living things and all things that grow and develop in stages. One of the most striking examples of this pattern of growth can found in the shell of the nautilus, which, when cross-sectioned, reveals a breathtaking repeating pattern of what looks like extended Hebrew Yods or English letter Gs. On a grander scale, it can be found in the formation of the great spiral nebulae. This primal pattern of patterns is, indeed, the ‚ÄúG‚Äù signature of the ‚ÄúGreat Architect of the Universe,‚Äù the name by which Freemasons refer to Deity. As far as I know, Ben Clifford is the first Qabalist (or alleged Qabalist) to make this profound and fundamental connection.</p><p>50</p><p>DOES GOD SPEAK HEBREW?</p><p>Hell no! God&rsquo;s a Chicken Qabalist and doesn&rsquo;t worry about it. Do you actually think there is a white-bearded giant in the clouds who created the universe and everything in it by belching out nouns and verbs right out of some celestial edition of Ben-Yehuda&rsquo;s Hebrew dictionary? I don&rsquo;t think so. The creative fiat, the language of the Deity, is not one of grunts and gurgles and hisses and sighs. It is a language of numbers. Numbers do all the work. What distinguishes the Hebrew alphabet is not its pronunciation or its words and grammar, but its intimate relationship with numbers.</p><p>If God ‚Äúsaid‚Äù anything in the beginning, it was most likely, ‚ÄúLet there be 3.‚Äù That&rsquo;s all that needed to be said because, as we learned in the Sepher Yetzirah, the 3 dimensions then just took off on their own and extended from the central point to instantly form 7 and 12 spatial coordinates‚Äîa tight little 22-piece toolbox of creation.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start our brief study of the Hebrew alphabet by first observing that the 22 letters are divided into 3 categories: 3 Mother letters, 7 Double letters, and 12 Simple letters. 3‚Äî7‚Äî12. What a coincidence.</p><p>50</p><p>3 MOTHER LETTERS</p><p>[representing three primal elements]</p><p>50</p><p>7 DOUBLE LETTERS</p><p>[representing the seven planets of the ancients]</p><p>50</p><p>12 SIMPLE LETTERS</p><p>[representing the twelve signs of the zodiac]</p><p>50</p><p>Figure 7. These 22 Letters join the 10 Sephiroth and, in doing so, create the Tree of Life.</p><p>50</p><p>1</p><p>Aleph‚ÄîA</p><p>51</p><p>Aleph is Path No. 11. It joins Kether (Crown) to Chokmah (Wisdom).</p><p>Aleph doesn&rsquo;t look like any other Hebrew letter and is therefore easy to recognize. It has one long diagonal bar that looks like a banana separating two small Yods. The Yod at the top right is connected to the banana at midpoint by a thin line (a Yod on a stick). The Yod at the bottom left is flattened at the bottom like a foot and is connected to the banana underneath its left shoulder.</p><p>Aleph is spelled¬†</p><p>(ALP). The three letters enumerate to 111 (or using Peh Final 831) and mean ‚Äúox.‚Äù In ancient cultures, the ox that pulled the furrowing plough was a supreme symbol of the fertilizing force of creation. Aleph is a letter of breath and the closest thing the Hebrew alphabet has to a vowel. As the plough of the ox penetrates and aerates the soil, so the breath of life penetrates and vivifies you and me. Oh hell! I&rsquo;ll come out and say it‚Äîthe Air of Aleph is more than just the firmament of atmosphere surrounding Earth‚Äîit is the Life-Force itself, the Prana of the Hindus, the active ingredient that makes the Holy Spirit holy). Give it some respect!</p><p>Aleph is one of the 3 Mother Letters and represents the element Air.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The Fool.</p><p>51</p><p>2</p><p>Beth‚ÄîB</p><p>51</p><p>Beth is Path No. 12. It joins Kether (Crown) to Binah (Understanding).</p><p>Note that the roof of Beth is an elongated Yod that slides to the right and drips down to smoothly form a leg. The leg is connected to a long right-leaning parallelogram that serves as the base of the letter. The leg connects near but not at the right edge of the base.</p><p>Beth¬†</p><p>Do not confuse with Kaph¬†</p><p>Beth is spelled¬†</p><p>(BYTh). The three letters enumerate to 412 and mean ‚Äúhouse.‚Äù Its shape suggests a cave, the earliest house. In biblical times, a house was often a tent. A house is fundamentally a container, but it is also a shelter, a sanctuary, and a resting place, and most importantly, a place to exist. Beth is the fundamental structure of the universe, a container of existence, a receptacle of life, an atom, a living cell, a body. Astrologers divide the Heavens into twelve ‚Äúhouses.‚Äù Family bloodlines and households are also considered ‚Äúhouses,‚Äù such as the House of David or the House of Frankenstein.</p><p>Beth is one of the 7 Double Letters and represents the planet Mercury.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The Magician.</p><p>52</p><p>3</p><p>Gimel‚ÄîG</p><p>52</p><p>Gimel is Path No. 13. It joins Kether (Crown) to Tiphareth (Beauty).</p><p>Gimel starts with a Yod that extends straight down from its bottom tear. This leg connects to a short right-leaning parallelogram that serves as the base of the letter. Note that the leg connects only partially to the top right edge of the base:</p><p>Do not confuse with Nun¬†</p><p>Gimel is spelled tea¬†</p><p>(GML). The three letters enumerate to 73 and mean ‚Äúcamel,‚Äù also to couple or team up. Like the ox, a camel is an animal domesticated to the service of humanity. The ox, however, is exploited in the cause of nourishment, the camel in the cause of communication. A camel is the ‚Äúship of the desert,‚Äù a vehicle of life and commerce, capable of crossing the vast abyss of sand. The Path of Gimel on the Tree of Life also crosses the Abyss and joins Kether to Tiphareth.</p><p>In Aramaic (the language allegedly spoken by Jesus) the word camel and the word rope are spelled exactly the same, ‚Äúgamla.‚Äù I wasn&rsquo;t there, so I can&rsquo;t say for sure, but I&rsquo;ll bet in Matthew 19:24 Jesus says, ‚ÄúIt is easier for a rope (not camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.‚Äù Duh!</p><p>Gimel is one of the 7 Double Letters and represents the Moon.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The High Priestess.</p><p>52</p><p>4</p><p>Daleth‚ÄîD</p><p>52</p><p>Daleth is Path No. 14. It joins Chokmah (Wisdom) to Binah (Understanding).</p><p>Daleth has a firm level roof. It is connected by a leg on the right side. Note that the leg connects near but not at the right edge of the roof. A little part of the roof hangs over the leg.</p><p>Do not confuse with Resh</p><p>Daleth is spelled¬†</p><p>(DLTh). The three letters enumerate to 434 and mean ‚Äúdoor.‚Äù A door is a valve that can bar or accommodate both the entrance and exit of things. It is a tent flap, a threshold, and a gate. Walk out of the door of your house and you move from the unity of your home to the multiplicity of the world and vice versa.</p><p>The most important ‚Äúdoor‚Äù for humans is a woman&rsquo;s womb and/or vagina. It accommodates the entrance of the fertilizing male member, and nine months later, it is the door through which we all enter the world.</p><p>Daleth is one of the 7 Double Letters and represents the planet Venus.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The Empress.</p><p>53</p><p>5</p><p>Heh‚ÄîH, E</p><p>Heh is Path No. 15. It joins Chokmah (Wisdom) to Tiphareth (Beauty).</p><p>Heh is drawn exactly like Daleth, but has an additional left leg. Note that the left leg does not touch the roof.</p><p>Do not confuse with Cheth¬†</p><p>or Tau¬†</p><p>Heh is spelled¬†</p><p>(HH). The two letters enumerate to 10 and mean ‚Äúwindow.‚Äù Also to breathe, to exist, to become, and to desire. A window is a transparent door, an eye through which we look out on the world. From within the house, we look out of the window at approaching visitors, so we can decide who to allow through the door and who to bar. A window also allows light and air to penetrate the house. Heh also means the identification of a star, as for navigation or astrology.</p><p>Its shape introduces the concept of openings‚Äîa small opening on the left and a large opening from below. This is suggestive of all things receptive, female, or negatively charged.</p><p>Heh is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Aries.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The Emperor.</p><p>53</p><p>6</p><p>Vau‚ÄîV,W,U,O</p><p>Vau is Path No. 16. It joins Chokmah (Wisdom) to Chesed (Mercy).</p><p>Vau starts with a Yod at the top that extends straight down from its bottom tear to form a right leg. Note that the leg connects to the top right edge of the Yod.</p><p>Do not confuse with Zain¬†</p><p>Vau is spelled¬†</p><p>The two letters enumerate to 12 and mean ‚Äúnail‚Äù or ‚Äúhook‚Äù or ‚Äúpin.‚Äù A hook can be used to suspend things from above. Nails and pins are sharp, pointy things that join two objects together by means of penetration. By its very shape, it represents the phallus. This implies union (yoga), and union with God is the goal of all mystics, especially Chicken Qabalists. The process is theoretically simple. Find the proper Vau and you can nail yourself to God! This concept of union is further underscored when we remember the letter Vau is the Hebrew conjunction ‚Äúand.‚Äù</p><p>Its shape introduces the concept of penetration, and is suggestive of all things aggressive, male, or positively charged.</p><p>Vau is a one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Taurus.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The Hierophant</p><p>54</p><p>7</p><p>Zain‚ÄîZ</p><p>Zain is Path No. 17. It joins Binah (Understanding) to Tiphareth (Beauty).</p><p>Zain is a Yod with a leg dropping down from its bottom center.</p><p>Do not confuse with Vau¬†</p><p>Zain is spelled¬†</p><p>(ZYN). The three letters enumerate to 67 (or using Nun Final 717) and mean ‚Äúsword.‚Äù A sword is a weapon of both offense and defense. It is the weapon of i nvoked force. It can be brandished as a deterrent or wielded to enforce the decisions of authority. A sword is also an instrument of division, separating one thing from another (like your enemy&rsquo;s head from his shoulders), and of discretion and analysis, separating one idea from another. In a way, it is just the opposite of Vau, which unites things.</p><p>Zain is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Gemini.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The Lovers.</p><p>54</p><p>8</p><p>Cheth-Ch</p><p>Cheth is Path No. 18. It joins Binah (Understanding) to Geburah (Strength).</p><p>Cheth is drawn exactly like Heh but both legs touch the roof.</p><p>Do not confuse with Heh¬†</p><p>or Tau</p><p>Cheth is spelled¬†</p><p>(ChYTh). The three letters enumerate to 418 and mean ‚Äúfield‚Äù and ‚Äúfence.‚Äù A fenced-in field implies cultivated land‚Äîland that has been set apart, defined, and then plowed by the ox. A fence encloses an area and sets it apart from the surrounding area. It is a wall, a hedge, a membrane, a shell, a womb, a crust, a fortress, a citadel. It surrounds and protects the sacred life and light within from the danger and darkness without. Cheth also indicates the Life-Force itself, and anything living.</p><p>Cheth is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Cancer.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The Chariot.</p><p>55</p><p>9</p><p>Teth-T</p><p>Teth is Path No. 19. It joins Chesed (Mercy) to Geburah (Strength).</p><p>Teth has a firm rectangular base from which sprout a mini-Zain from the left edge and a sharp leftward-crashing wave arising from the right edge. I think it looks like the profile of a duck swimming on the water looking back at a big Yod that&rsquo;s stuck to the tip of its tail. Note that the duck&rsquo;s bill does not touch the Yod on its tail.</p><p>Do not confuse with Mem¬†</p><p>Teth is spelled¬†</p><p>(TYTh). The three letters enumerate to 419 and mean ‚Äúserpent.‚Äù Human beings are vertebrates and our spines are home to unimaginable energy and power. We are snakes with arms and legs, and this serpent energy is the key to our divine birthright. Like a snake swallowing its tail, there is truly no end to the mystery of the serpent. The one that tempted Eve is the same one that Moses elevated on a pole, and the same one that Jesus told us to be as ‚Äúwise as.‚Äù</p><p>It is also interesting to note that the ancients were aware that individual sperm cells look like tiny snakes with giant (lion-like) heads.</p><p>Teth is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Leo.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: Strength.</p><p>55</p><p>10</p><p>Yod-Y, I, J</p><p>Yod is Path No. 20. It joins Chesed (Mercy) to Tiphareth (Beauty).</p><p>Yod is a flame. Blow upon it and you create all the other letters of the alphabet. Yod is my favorite Hebrew letter because it is so simple. It is the perfect pattern of primal creation‚Äîa point extending to become the whirling motion. It is Phi, the seed of the Golden Spiral; the mystic ‚ÄúG‚Äù in your grandfather&rsquo;s Masonic ring; the Yin and Yang; the human embryo; the blueprint of the ram&rsquo;s horn and the nautilus; the swirling cream in your coffee, and the billowing dynamics of smoke and air and water. It sets the pattern for our fingerprints, our DNA and the shape of great galaxies. It is the primal male-Shiva divine fire that plunges joyously into the female-Shakti ocean of divine water.</p><p>Yod is spelled¬†</p><p>(YVD) [which is not a public health question]. The three letters enumerate to 20 and mean ‚Äúhand.‚Äù Using Qabalistic logic, Yod is the key creative instrument of the Deity in the same way that the hand is a key creative instrument of human beings. Follow me? The human hand, however, is only the mundane member of creation. A secret and more profound equivalent of the creative hand is the spermatozoon, itself, of which I believe Yod is the most appropriate hieroglyph.</p><p>Yod is one of the 12 Simple Letters and represents the zodiacal sign of Virgo.</p><p>TAROT TRUMP: The Hermit.</p><p>74</p><p>6</p><p>THE FOUR QABALISTIC WORLDS AND THE FOUR PARTS OF THE SOUL</p><p>74</p><p>this surviving fragment deals with the all-important subjects of the Tetragrammaton Yod Heh Vau Heh),</p><p>89</p><p>7</p><p>THE TREE OF LIFE</p><p>97</p><p>if I were the Deity before creation, I must have been very lonely. Being the only and absolute Being, I might not even realize the nature of my own self. I symbolize this pre-creational state as a simple circle (I have chosen this figure because a circle has no beginning or end) and designate it by the holy number ONE.</p><p>98</p><p>Now, since I am ONE and absolute, it follows that ONE is the only real number‚Äîthe only legitimate reality. As the Deity, I think I would be quite happy in my condition of oneness, and leave it at that, but something clearly happened to induce me to create. In order for me to create the many things in the universe, I would need to create more numbers. I think it happened like this:</p><p>98</p><p>I was alone and bored, and began to ponder the nature of myself. ‚ÄúWhat am I?‚Äù This was difficult because I was the only ONE. I had nothing else with which to compare myself. I wasn&rsquo;t a ‚Äúthis‚Äù or a ‚Äúthat‚Äù because I had not yet created ‚Äúthises‚Äù or ‚Äúthats.‚Äù I was the absolute, there was no ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of me. I could not hold up a mirror and look at my image and say, ‚ÄúOh look! I&rsquo;m one of those!‚Äù I could, however, with great stillness and concentration, turn the focus of my attention inward and, like the holy men of India, observe my perfect reflection at the very center of my being. I would then for the first time be conscious of myself. ‚ÄúI am this!‚Äù I would shout.</p><p>98</p><p>Even instantly, as these words echoed in my absoluteness, I would fall from my pristine state of singularity, for I would now have to admit the concept of TWO:</p><p>98</p><p>Oh! Curse the moment I ever brought TWO into existence, because the moment my Self became conscious of my reflection (my Not-Self), a third concept was created, that is‚Ä¶the knowledge of the difference between Self and Not-Self. ‚ÄúI am ‚Äòthis&rsquo; but ‚Äòthat&rsquo; is not I.‚Äù</p><p>98</p><p>creation commenced when the Deity stirred from undistracted ecstasy and became self-conscious, an act which transformed Its self-existence (as the inscrutable Divine Unity) into Its self-image (as the Deity of creation). Therefore, I suggest that we also consider the number THREE one of our primary holy numbers.</p><p>99</p><p>Since TWO and THREE are merely attributes of ONE, they should be considered along with the number ONE as a Trinity Unit.</p><p>99</p><p>The Trinity Unit then behaves in precisely the same manner as the original ONE did when it reflected itself to become TWO. It reflects itself to create a second Trinity Unit:</p><p>99</p><p>A third Trinity Unit is instantly created in the same way that the original THREE was instantly created upon the birth of TWO:</p><p>99</p><p>creation commences when the Deity defines itself and becomes self-conscious‚Äîa three-part act which defines ONE as an abstract and unmanifested Trinity (the Supernal Triad). But what Zabad was apparently too distracted to realize was that the Deity cannot stop at self-knowledge. Momentum has been established which will result in a further series of six phenomenal emanations by which the universe will categorize itself and organize its infinite potentialities. The following diagram will illustrate this idea.</p><p>99</p><p>I believe that TEN hangs from the three Triads like a cosmic dingle-berry and provides an environment‚Äîa Kingdom‚Äîthat traps the diffused and crystallized divine light inside a prison of matter. We live in this Kingdom. It is the lowest of the emanations. It is where the Divine Light vibrates at its lowest frequency. It is where the invisible becomes visible.</p><p>100</p><p>When we look at all ten steps of creation, we see that the TENTH emanation is the reflection of the NINTH, which is the reflection of the SIXTH, which is the reflection of the ONE.</p><p>100</p><p>Figure 19. The steps of creation.</p><p>99</p><p>Figure 18. Projection, Shattering, and Manifestation of the Divine Light.</p><p>100</p><p>To form the backbone of the Ten Numbered Bubbles of Jozabad, the numbers and are as critical to the structure of the universe as the spine is to the human body. They are also indicative of the four letters of the name of Diety ,(Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh) and all that It represents in the universe and the human soul.11 If the class has any doubt about this, let me point out that the sum of and equals 26, the same as the supreme name of God .</p><p>100</p><p>Furthermore (and most importantly I believe), when we insert the three paths that join and we create a total of 12 paths. (I call them Zabad&rsquo;s Twelve Paths of Glory.) These 12 paths link the 10 emanations and bring the total steps of creation to the sacred number TWENTY-TWO!</p><p>100</p><p>I believe that I have succeeded in demonstrating how the Deity (1) through the medium of 4, 10, and 22, created the universe and the nature of reality as we perceive it. I think it should be obvious to Rabbi Roe and the entire class that I have mastered the assignment and have wrenched all the wisdom that can be extracted from this line of thinking. I suggest we now move on to another subject, like when do we go co-ed?</p><p>101</p><p>there are two additional pillars that flank the middle pillar (Figure 21).</p><p>101</p><p>As it is postulated, each one of us is made in the image of the Deity. These two pillars correspond to the right and left side of the human body (the middle pillar being the spine). They also accommodate the entire spectrum of universal opposites that so profoundly divide our perception of reality; light-darkness, male-female, strength-weakness, the middle pillar serving to balance and harmonize these extremes.</p><p>101</p><p>the paths which join the 10 Sephiroth are not merely nails that attach the emanations, but are actually conduits of divine intelligence, which transmit the influence of each Sephirah back and forth between its neighbor. Consequently, all the Sephiroth should be joined by paths (shown in figure 22 on page 124).</p><p>102</p><p>You will notice in my diagram that I have drawn broken paths leading from 3 to 4 and from 2 to 5. This is because I believe that these paths do not exist. To explain this, we must return for a moment to Zabad&rsquo;s earlier essay, which explained how ONE became THREE. If you recall, he wrote that ONE is the only real number. TWO is just a projected reflection of ONE, and THREE merely a condition of recognition that TWO is not ONE.</p><p>102</p><p>So, too, is the only real Triad; the Triad of is only its reflection, and the third Triad is merely the replication of the second. The area between the first Triad and the second Triad is like the impenetrable surface of a mirror. It is an inscrutable Abyss.</p><p>102</p><p>As I gaze into the mirror hanging on the wall in my dormitory room, I see my reflection, an unreal image of the real me in my real room. So it is with the Deity. The Supernal Triad () is the real thing existing on the real side of the mirror/Abyss. On the unreal side of the Abyss are all the unreal things (including you and me and everything we perceive in the universe). They assume a semblance of reality because they, like my reflection in the mirror, are bound by the image of the real supernal patterns and forms.</p><p>102</p><p>Just as I give a kind of life to my reflection in the mirror, so all the manifold units of creation are vivified by the Living Light of the Supernal Triad. Indeed, that Light is our true identity. What we think is our body, our world, our self, is only the shadowy reflection of the Divine Being whose radiance shattered at the Abyss. We aren&rsquo;t even truly alive, we are just the reflection of real life. ‚ÄúAnd created the Elohim Adam in the image of Elohim created they them, male and female created they them.‚Äù</p><p>102</p><p>Just as we cannot walk into a room reflected in a mirror, a path cannot exist between of the Supernal Triad and of the second Triad. Other paths appear to cross the Abyss, but they aren&rsquo;t really Paths, but either reflected paths or avenues of reflection:</p><p>102</p><p>Figure 23. Reflecting paths.</p><p>103</p><p>The path joining¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>is the avenue of reflection between¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>.</p><p>The path joining¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>is the avenue of reflection between¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>.</p><p>The path joining¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>is the avenue of reflection between¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>.</p><p>The path joining¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>is reflected as the path joining¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>.</p><p>The path joining¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>is reflected as the path joining¬†</p><p>and¬†</p><p>.</p><p>103</p><p>This leaves us with 22 paths joining the 10 Sephiroth. I presume to call the entire thing ‚ÄúRamiah&rsquo;s 32 Mysterious Paths of Wisdom.‚Äù It is my firm belief (although I am not prepared to elucidate further at the moment) that these 22 paths have a direct correspondence with the 22 letters of our sacred Hebrew alphabet. I further contend that the mystery of their placement upon this Tree of Life (as I have also presumed to name it) is the key to eventual return to our original divine estate.</p><p>104</p><p>8</p><p>QABALISTIC MAGICK AND THE TREE OF LIFE</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/The-Chicken-Qabalah/ data-ctx="Inbox scrap 43" data-src=/The-Chicken-Qabalah class=internal-link>The Chicken Qabalah</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#D0A4FF}</style><script src=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bryce Mcalister using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com>Home</a></li><li><a href></a></li><li><a href></a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
