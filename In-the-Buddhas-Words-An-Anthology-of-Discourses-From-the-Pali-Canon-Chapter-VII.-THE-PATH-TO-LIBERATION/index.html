The Shorter Discourse to Māluṅkyāputta (MN 63), shows that the Buddhist path is not designed to provide theoretical answers to philosophical questions.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3888
In this sutta the monk Māluṅkyāputta approaches the Buddha and demands answers to ten speculative questions, threatening to leave the Saṅgha if this demand is not satisfied.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4002
“These speculative views have been left undeclared by the Blessed One, set aside and rejected by him, namely: ‘the world is eternal’ and ‘the world is not eternal’; ‘the world is finite’ and ‘the world is infinite’; ‘the soul is the same as the body’ and ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’; and ‘after death a Tathāgata exists’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’
(Majjhima Nikaya 63: Cūḷamāluṅkya Sutta; I 426–32)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3891
Two collections of suttas in the Saṃyutta Nikāya—SN 33:1–10 and SN 44:7–8—make it clear that the Buddha’s “silence” had a deeper basis than mere pragmatic concerns.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3892
These suttas show that all such questions are based on an underlying assumption that existence is to be interpreted in terms of a self and a world in which the self is situated. Since these premises are invalid, no answer framed in terms of these premises can be valid, and thus the Buddha must reject the very questions themselves.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3895
However, while the Buddha had philosophical grounds for refusing to answer these questions, he also rejected them because he considered the obsession with their solutions to be irrelevant to the quest for release from suffering.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4057
“Why have I left that undeclared? Because it is unbeneficial, it does not belong to the fundamentals of the spiritual life, it does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.
(Majjhima Nikaya 63: Cūḷamāluṅkya Sutta; I 426–32)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4043
’If there is the view ‘the world is finite’ &mldr; ‘the world is infinite’ ‘the soul is the same as the body’ &mldr; ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’ … ‘after death a Tathāgata exists’ … ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist,’ the spiritual life cannot be lived.… If there is the view ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist&mldr; there is birth, there is aging, there is death, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair, the destruction of which I prescribe here and now.
(Majjhima Nikaya 63: Cūḷamāluṅkya Sutta; I 426–32)</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3909
the purpose of practicing the spiritual life under the Buddha is “the fading away of lust, … final Nibbāna without clinging,” the Noble Eightfold Path being the way to attain each of these aims</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4147
“Monks, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is the spiritual life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘It is, friends, for the fading away of lust
(Samyutta Nikaya 45:41–48, combined; V 27–29)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4155
[Or else you may answer them:] ‘It is, friends, for the abandoning of the fetters … for the uprooting of the underlying tendencies … for the full understanding of the course [of saṃsāra] … for the destruction of the taints … for the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation … for the sake of knowledge and vision … for the sake of final Nibbāna without clinging that the spiritual life is lived under the Blessed One.’
(Samyutta Nikaya 45:41–48, combined; V 27–29)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3911
The Noble Eightfold Path is the classical formulation of the way to liberation, as is already clear from the Buddha’s first sermon, in which he calls the Eightfold Path the way to the cessation of suffering.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3923
The eight factors are commonly distributed into three groups as follows:</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3924
the moral discipline group (sīlakkhandha), made up of right speech, right action, and right livelihood;</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4172
“And what, monks, is right speech? Abstinence from false speech, abstinence from malicious speech, abstinence from harsh speech, abstinence from idle chatter: this is called right speech.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4175
“And what, monks, is right livelihood? Here a noble disciple, having abandoned a wrong mode of livelihood, earns his living by a right livelihood: this is called right livelihood.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4173
“And what, monks, is right action? Abstinence from the destruction of life, abstinence from taking what is not given, abstinence from sexual misconduct: this is called right action.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3926
the concentration group (sam̄dhikkhandha), made up of right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration;</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4176
“And what, monks, is right effort? Here, monks, a monk generates desire for the nonarising of unarisen evil unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states…. He generates desire for the arising of unarisen wholesome states…. He generates desire for the continuation of arisen wholesome states, for their nondecline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. This is called right effort.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4181
“And what, monks is right mindfulness? Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body,
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4182
He dwells contemplating feelings
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4183
He dwells contemplating mind in mind,
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4184
He dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena,
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4184
ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world. This is called right mindfulness.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4185
“And what, monks, is right concentration?
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4186
first jhāna,
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4186
which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4188
second jhāna,
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4188
which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4189
With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4190
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, he enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna,
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4191
which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3927
the wisdom group (paññākkhandha), made up of right view and right intention.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4169
“And what, monks, is right view? Knowledge of suffering, knowledge of the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of suffering, knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: this is called right view.
(Saṃyutta Nikāya 45:8; V 8–10)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4170
“And what,monks, is right intention? Intention of renunciation, intention of non–ill will, intention of harmlessness: this is called right intention.

Contrary to a common assumption, the eight path factors are not steps to be followed in sequence, one after another. They are more appropriately described as components than as steps. Optimally, all eight factors should be present simultaneously, each making its own distinctive contribution, like eight interwoven strands of a cable that give the cable maximum strength.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3922
However, until that stage is reached, it is inevitable that the factors of the path exhibit some degree of sequence in their development.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li>Highlight(pink) - Location 3932
In the Nikāyas, the Buddha often expounds the practice of the path as a gradual training (anupubbasikkhā) that unfolds in stages from the first step to the final goal. This gradual training is a finer subdivision of the threefold division of the path into moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom.</li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3934
Invariably in the suttas the exposition of the gradual training begins with the going forth into homelessness and the adoption of the lifestyle of a bhikkhu, a Buddhist monk. This immediately calls attention to the importance of the monastic life in the Buddha’s pragmatic vision.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3936
In principle the entire practice of the Noble Eightfold Path is open to people from any mode of life, monastic or lay, and the Buddha confirms that many among his lay followers were accomplished in the Dhamma and had attained the first three of the four stages of awakening, up to nonreturning</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3938
(an̄ḡm̄; Theravāda commentators say that lay followers can also attain the fourth stage, arahantship, but they do so either on the verge of death or after attainment immediately seek the going forth).</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3939
The fact remains, however, that the household life inevitably fosters a multitude of mundane concerns and personal attachments that impede the single-hearted quest for liberation. Thus when the Buddha set out on his own noble quest he did so by going into homelessness,</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4269
“A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: ‘Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the spiritual life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.
(Majjhima Nikāya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3941
after his enlightenment, as a practical way to help others, he established the Saṅgha, the order of monks and nuns, for those who want to devote themselves fully to the Dhamma unhindered by the cares of household life.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3943
The gradual training occurs in two versions: a longer version in the Dīgha Nikāya and a middle-length version in the Majjhima Nikāya.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3944
(1) the longer version has a more detailed treatment of the observances that pertain to monastic etiquette and ascetic self-restraint;</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3945
(2) the longer version includes eight types of higher knowledge while the middle-length version has three types. However, as these three types are the ones mentioned in the Buddha’s account of his own enlightenment (see Text II,3(2)), they are by far the most important.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3951
The sequence opens with the appearance of a Tathāgata in the world and his exposition of the Dhamma. Having heard this, the disciple acquires faith and follows the Teacher into homelessness. He then undertakes the rules of discipline that promote the purification of conduct and the right livelihood of an ascetic.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4264

The section on the abandonment of the five hindrances deals with the preliminary training in concentration. The five hindrances—sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt—are the principal obstacles to meditative development, and thus they must be removed for the mind to become collected and unified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4312

The next stage in the sequence describes the attainment of the jhānas, profound states of concentration in which the mind becomes fully absorbed in its object.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3961
The Buddha enumerates four jhānas, named simply after their numerical position in the series, each more refined and elevated than its predecessor.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4320
first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion.

fourth jhāna,

Although wisdom rather than concentration is the critical factor in the attainment of enlightenment, the Buddha invariably includes the jhānas in the gradual training for at least two reasons: first, because they contribute to the intrinsic perfection of the path; and second, because the deep concentration they induce serves as a basis for the arising of insight.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3965
The Buddha calls the jhānas the “footsteps of the Tathāgata” (MN 27.19–22) and shows them to be precursors of the bliss of Nibbāna that lies at the end of the training.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4326
This too, brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathāgata … but a noble disciple does not yet come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened.…’
(Majjhima Nikaya 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta; I 175–84)</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3967
From the fourth jhāna three alternative lines of further development become possible.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3968
first line: four meditative states that continue the mental unification established by the jhānas. These states, described as “the liberations that are peaceful and formless,” are further refinements of concentration.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3969
Distinguished from the jhānas by their transcendence of the subtle mental image that serves as the object in the jhānas, they are named the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3972
A second line of development is the acquisition of supernormal knowledge.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3972
The Buddha frequently refers to a set of six types,</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3973
six kinds of direct knowledge</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3973
The last of these, the knowledge of the destruction of the taints, is “supramundane” or world-transcending and thus marks the culmination of the third line of development. But the other five are all mundane, products of the extraordinarily powerful mental concentration achieved in the fourth jhāna:</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3975
the supernormal powers, the divine ear, the ability to read the minds of others, the recollection of past lives, and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3977
The jhānas and the formless attainments by themselves do not issue in enlightenment and liberation. Though lofty and peaceful, they can only silence the defilements that sustain the round of rebirths but cannot eradicate them.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3978
To uproot the defilements at the most fundamental level, and thereby arrive at enlightenment and liberation, the meditative process must be directed to a third line of development. This is the contemplation of “things as they really are,” which results in increasingly deeper insights into the nature of existence and culminates in the final goal, the attainment of arahantship.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3981
This line of development is the one the Buddha pursues in the passage on the gradual training.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3982
he prefaces it with descriptions of two of the direct knowledges,</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3982
the recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings.</p></li></ul><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 3983
collectively called the three true knowledges</p><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4334
“When his mind is thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives.

He understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus: ‘These beings who behaved wrongly by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook actions based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who behaved well by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook action based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’

Although the first two are not essential to the realization of arahantship, the Buddha probably includes them here because they reveal the truly vast and profound dimensions of suffering in saṃsāra, thereby preparing the mind for the penetration of the Four Noble Truths by which that suffering is diagnosed and surmounted.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - 3986

When the disciple’s mind is liberated from the taints by the completion of the path of arahantship, he reviews his newly won freedom and roars his lion’s roar: “Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done; there is no more coming back to any state of being.”</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 4361
