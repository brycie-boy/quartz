I have decided to use the wordpost-modernto describe that condition. The word is in current use on the<br>American continent among sociologists and critics; it designates<br>the state of our culture foEowing the transformations which, since the<br>end of the nineteenth century, have altered the game rules for<br>science, literature, and the arts. The present study will place these<br>transformations in the context of the crisis of narrative</p><p>24</p><p>Science has always been in conflict with narratives. Judged by the<br>yardstick of science, the majority of them prove to be fables. But to<br>the extent that science does not restrict itself to stating useful<br>regularities and seeks the truth, it is obliged to legitimate the rules of<br>its own game. It then produces a discourse of legitimation with<br>respect to its own status, a discourse called philosophy. I will use the<br>termmodernto designate any science that legitimates itself with<br>reference to a metadiscourse of this kind making an explicit appeal<br>to some grand narrative, such as the dialectics of Spirit, the her-meneutics of meaning, the emancipation of the rational or working<br>subject, or the creation of wealt</p><p>24</p><p>. For example, the rule of consensus<br>between the sender and addressee of a statement with truth-value is<br>deemed acceptable if it is cast in terms of a possible unanimity be-tween rational minds: this is the Enlightenment narrative, in which<br>xxiiixxiv G INTRODUCTION<br>the hero of knowledge works toward a good ethico-political endÂ <br>â€”universal peace. As can be seen from this example, if a metanarrative<br>implying a philosophy of history is used to legitimate knowledge,<br>questions are raised concerning the validity of the institutions govern-ing the social bond: these must be legitimated as well. Thus justice is<br>consigned to the grand narrative in the same way as truth.</p><p>25</p><p>Simplifying to the extreme, I definepostmodernas incredulity<br>toward metanarratives. This incredulity is undoubtedly a product<br>of progress in the sciences: but that progress in turn presupposes it.<br>To the obsolescence of the metanarrative apparatus of legitimation<br>corresponds, most notably, the crisis of metaphysical philosophy<br>and of the university institution which in the past relied on it. The<br>narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great<br>dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in<br>clouds of narrative language elementsâ€”narrative, but also denotative,<br>prescriptive, descriptive, and so on. Conveyed within each cloud are<br>pragmatic valencies specific to its kind. Each of us lives at the inter-section of many of these. However, we do not necessarily establish<br>stable language combinations, and the properties of the ones we do<br>establish are not necessarily communicabl</p><p>25</p><p>Thus the society of the future falls less within the province ofÂ <br>aNewtonian anthropology (such as stucturalism or systems theory)<br>than a pragmatics of language particles. There are many different<br>language gamesâ€”a heterogeneity of elements. They only give rise to<br>institutions in patchesâ€”local determinis</p><p>25</p><p>The decision makers, however, attempt to manage these clouds of<br>sociality according to input/output matrices, following a logic which<br>implies that their elements are commensurable and that the whole is<br>determinable. They allocate our lives for the growth of power. In<br>matters of social justice and of scientific truth alike, the legitimation<br>of that power is based on its optimizing the system&rsquo;s performanceÂ <br>â€”efficiency. The application of this criterion to all of our games neces-sarily entails a certain level of terror, whether soft or hard: be opera-tional (that is, commensurable) or disappear.</p><p>25</p><p>The logic of maximum performance is no doubt inconsistent in<br>many ways, particularly with respect to contradiction in the socio-economic field: it demands both less work (to lower production<br>costs) and more (to lessen the social burden of the idle population).<br>But our incredulity is now such that we no longer expect salvation to<br>rise from these inconsistencies, as did Marx.</p><p>25</p><p>Still, the postmodern condition is as much a stranger to disenchant-ment as it is to the blind positivity of delegitimation. Where, afterINTRODUCTION D xxv<br>the metanarratives, can legitimacy reside? The operativity criterion<br>is technological; it has no relevance for judging what is true or just.<br>Is legitimacy to be found in consensus obtained through discussion,<br>as Ju&rsquo;rgen Habermas thinks? Such consensus does violence to the<br>heterogeneity of language games. And invention is always born of<br>dissension. Postmodern knowledge is not simply a tool of the author-ities; it refines our sensitivity to differences and reinforces our ability<br>to tolerate the incommensurable. Its principle is not the expert&rsquo;s<br>homology, but the inventor&rsquo;s paralogy.</p><p>26</p><p>Here is the question: is a legitimation of the social bond, a just<br>society, feasible in terms of a paradox analogous to that of scientific<br>activity? What would such a paradox be?</p><p>26</p><p>It remains to be said that the author of the report is a philosopher,<br>not an expert. The latter knows what he knows and what he does not<br>know: the former does no</p><p>30</p><p>Our working hypothesis is that the status of knowledge is altered as<br>societies enter what is known as the postindustrial age and cultures<br>enter what is known as the postmodern age.1<br>This transition has been<br>under way since at least the end of the 1950s, which for Europe<br>marks the completion of reconstructio</p><p>30</p><p>Rather than painting a picture that would inevitably remain in-complete, I will take as my point of departure a single feature, one<br>that immediately defines our object of study. Scientific knowledge is<br>a kind of discourse. And it is fair to say that for the last forty years<br>the &ldquo;leading&rdquo; sciences and technologies have had to do with language:<br>phonology and theories of linguistics,4<br>problems of communication<br>and cybernetics,5<br>modern theories of algebra and informatics,6<br>computers and their languages,7<br>problems of translation and the<br>search for areas of compatibility among computer languages,8<br>prob-lems of information storage and data banks,9<br>telematics and the<br>34 D THE POSTMODERN CONDITION<br>perfection of intelligent terminals,10<br>paradoxology.11<br>The facts<br>speak for themselves (and this list is not exhaustive).</p><p>31</p><p>These technological transformations can be expected to haveÂ <br>aconsiderable impact on knowledge. Its two principal functionsÂ <br>â€”research and the transmission of acquired learningâ€”are already feel-ing the effect, or will in the futur</p><p>31</p><p>, it is common knowledge that<br>the miniaturization and commercialization of machines is already<br>changing the way in which learning is acquired, classified, made avail-able, and exploited.12<br>It is reasonable to suppose that the prolifera-tion of information-processing machines is having, and will continue<br>to have, as much of an effect on the circulation of learning as did ad-vancements in human circulation (transportation systems) and later,<br>in the circulation of sounds and visual images (the media).13</p><p>31</p><p>The nature of knowledge cannot survive unchanged within this<br>context of general transformation. It can fit into the new channels,<br>and become operational, only if learning is translated into quantities<br>of information.14<br>We can predict that anything in the constituted<br>body of knowledge that is not translatable in this way will be aban-doned and that the direction of new research will be dictated by the<br>possibility of its eventual results being translatable into computer<br>language. The &ldquo;producers&rdquo; and users of knowledge must now, and<br>will have to, possess the means of translating into these languages<br>whatever they want to invent or learn. Research on translating<br>machines is already well advanced.15<br>Along with the hegemony of<br>computers comes a certain logic, and therefore a certain set of pre-scriptions determining which statements are accepted as &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;<br>statements.</p><p>31</p><p>We may thus expect a thorough exteriorization of knowledge with<br>respect to the &ldquo;knower,&rdquo; at whatever point he or she may occupy in<br>the knowledge process. The old principle that the acquisition of<br>knowledge is indissociable from the training(Bildung)of minds, or<br>even of individuals, is becoming obsolete and will become ever more<br>so. The relationship of the suppliers and users of knowledge to the<br>knowledge they supply and use is now tending, and will increasingly<br>tend, to assume the form already taken by the relationship of com-modity producers and consumers to the commodities they produce<br>and consumeâ€”that is, the form of value. Knowledge is and will be<br>produced in order to be sold, it is and will be consumed in order to<br>be valorized in a new production: in both cases, the goal is exchange.THEPOSTMODERNCONDITION DÂ <br>5Knowledge ceases to be an end in itself, it loses its &ldquo;use-value.&ldquo;16</p><p>32</p><p>It is widely accepted that knowledge has become the principle<br>force of production over the last few decades;17<br>this has already had<br>a noticeable effect on the composition of the work force of the most<br>highlydevelopedcountries18<br>ndconstitutesthemajorbottleneck<br>for the developing countries. In the postindustrial and postmodern<br>age, science will maintain and no doubt strengthen its preeminence in<br>the arsenal of productive capacities of the nation-states. Indeed, this<br>situation is one of the reasons leading to the conclusion that the gap<br>between developed and developing countries will grow ever wider in<br>the future.19<br>But this aspect of the problem should not be allowed to over-shadow the other, which is complementary to it. Knowledge in the<br>form of an informational commodity indispensable to productive<br>power is already, and will continue to be, a majorâ€”perhapsthe<br>majorâ€”stake in the worldwide competition for power. It is conceiv-able that the nation-states will one day fight for control of informa-tion, just as they battled in the past for control over territory, and<br>afterwards for control of access to and exploitation of raw materials<br>and cheap labor. A new field is opened for industrial and commercial<br>strategiesontheonehand,and political and military strategies on<br>the other.20</p><p>32</p><p>However, the perspective I have outlined above is not as simple as<br>I have made it appear. For the mercantilization of knowledge is<br>bound to affect the privilege the nation-states have enjoyed, and still<br>enjoy, with respect to the production and distribution of learning.<br>The notion that learning falls within the purview of the State, as the<br>brain or mind of society, will become more and more outdated with<br>the increasing strength of the opposing principle, according to which<br>society exists and progresses only if the messages circulating within<br>it are rich in information and easy to decode. The ideology of com-municational &ldquo;transparency,&rdquo; which goes hand in hand with the<br>commercialization of knowledge, will begin to perceive the State as<br>a factor of opacity and &ldquo;noise.&rdquo; It is from this point of view that<br>the problem of the relationship between economic and State powers<br>threatens to arise with a new urgency.</p><p>32</p><p>Already in the last few decades, economic powers have reached<br>the point of imperiling the stability of the State through new forms<br>of the circulation of capital that go by the generic name ofmulti-national corporations.These new forms of circulation imply that<br>investment decisions have, at least in part, passed beyond the control<br>of the nation-states.21<br>The question threatens to become even more6 O THE POSTMODERN CONDITION<br>thorny with the development of computer technology and telematic</p><p>33</p><p>Suppose, for example, that a firm such as IBM is authorized to occupy<br>a belt in the earth&rsquo;s orbital field and launch communications satel-lites or satellites housing data banks.

In the first place, scientific know-ledge does not represent the totality of knowledge; it has always<br>existed in addition to, and in competition and conflict with, another<br>kind of knowledge, which I will call narrative in the interests of<br>simplicity (its characteristics will be described later).

I use the word in a broader<br>sense than do contemporary German theorists in their discussions of<br>the question of authority.Take any civil law as an example: it<br>states that a given category of citizens must perform a specific kind<br>of action. Legitimation is the process by which a legislator is author-ized to promulgate such a law as a norm.

But as we will see, it is not. The<br>question of the legitimacy of science has been indissociably linked to<br>that of the legitimation of the legislator since the time of Plato.<br>From this point of view, the right to decide what is true is not inde-pendent of the right to decide what is just, even if the statements<br>consigned to these two authorities differ in nature.

The distinctive<br>feature of this second, &ldquo;performative,&ldquo;30<br>utterance is that its effect<br>upon the referent coincides with its enunciation. The university is<br>open because it has been declared open in the above-mentioned<br>circumstances.

Actually,<br>we could say it the other way around: the sender is dean or rectorâ€”<br>that is, he is invested with the authority to make this kind of state-mentâ€”only insofar as he can directly affect both the referent, (the<br>university) and the addressee (the university staff) in the mannerÂ <br>Ihave indicate</p><p>36</p><p>A different case involves utterances of the type, &ldquo;Give money to10 D THE POSTMODERN CONDITION<br>the university&rdquo;; these are prescriptions.

The first is that their rules do not carry within them-selves their own legitimation, but are the object of a contract, explicit<br>or not, between players (which is not to say that the players invent<br>the rules). The second is that if there are no rules, there is no game,33<br>that even an infinitesimal modification of one rule alters the nature<br>of the game, that a &ldquo;move&rdquo; or utterance that does not satisfy the<br>rules does not belong to the game they define. The third remark is<br>suggested by what has just been said: every utterance should be<br>thought of as a &ldquo;move&rdquo; in a game.</p><p>37</p><p>This last observation brings us to the first principle underlying our<br>method as a whole: to speak is to fight, in the sense of playing, and<br>s<br>peechacts34fallwithinthedomainofageneralagonistics.35 Thidoes not necessarily mean that one plays in order to win.

Simplifying<br>to the extreme, it is fair to say that in principle there have been, at<br>least over the last half-century, two basic representational models for<br>society: either society forms a functional whole, or it is divided in<br>two. An illustration of the first model is suggested by Talcott Parsons<br>(at least the postwar Parsons) and his school, and of the second, by<br>the Marxist current (all of its component schools, whatever differ-ences they may have, accept both the principle of class struggle and<br>dialectics as a duality operating within society).37</p><p>38</p><p>This methodological split, which defines two major kinds of dis-course on society, has been handed down from the nineteenth<br>century. The idea that society forms an organic whole, in the absence<br>of which it ceases to be a society (and sociology ceases to have an<br>object of study), dominated the minds of the founders of the French<br>school. Added detail was supplied by functionalism; it took yet<br>another turn in the 1950s with Parsons&rsquo;s conception of society asÂ <br>aself-regulating system. The theoretical and even material model is<br>no longer the living organism; it is provided by cybernetics, which,<br>during and after the Second World War, expanded the model&rsquo;s<br>applications.</p><p>38</p><p>In Parsons&rsquo;s work, the principle behind the system is still, ifÂ <br>Imay say so, optimistic: it corresponds to the stabilization of the<br>growth economies and societies of abundance under the aegis ofÂ <br>amoderate welfare state.38<br>In the work of contemporary German<br>theorists,systemtheorieis technocratic, even cynical, not to men-tion despairing: the harmony between the needs and hopes of<br>individuals or groups and the functions guaranteed by the system is<br>now only a secondary component of its functioning. The true goal<br>of the system, the reason it programs itself like a computer, is the<br>optimization of the global relationship between input and outputÂ <br>â€”in other words, performativity. Even when its rules are in the process<br>of changing and innovations are occurring, even when its dysfunc-tions (such as strikes, crises, unemployment, or political revolutions)<br>inspire hope and lead to belief in an alternative, even then what is12 D THE POSTMODERN CONDITION<br>actually taking place is only an internal readjustment, and its result<br>can be no more than an increase in the system&rsquo;s &ldquo;viability.&rdquo; The only<br>alternative to this kind of performance improvement is entropy, or<br>decline.39</p><p>39</p><p>Here again, while avoiding the simplifications inherent in a sociol-ogy of social theory, it is difficult to deny at least a parallel between<br>this &ldquo;hard&rdquo; technocratic version of society and the ascetic effort that<br>was demanded (the fact that it was done in name of &ldquo;advanced<br>liberalism&rdquo; is beside the point) of the most highly developed industrial<br>societies in order to make them competitiveâ€”and thus optimize their<br>&ldquo;rationality&rdquo;â€”within the framework of the resumption of economic<br>world war in the 1960s.</p><p>39</p><p>Even taking into account the massive displacement intervening be-tween the thought of a man like Comte and the thought of Luhmann,<br>we can discern a common conception of the social: society is a uni-fied totality, a &ldquo;unicity.&rdquo; Parsons formulates this clearly: &ldquo;The most<br>essential condition of successful dynamic analysis is a continual and<br>systematic reference of every problem to the state of the system asÂ <br>awhole. &mldr; A process or set of conditions either &lsquo;contributes&rsquo; to the<br>maintenance (or development) of the system or it is &lsquo;dysfunctional&rsquo;<br>in that it detracts from the integration, effectiveness, etc., of the<br>system.&ldquo;40<br>The &ldquo;technocrats41<br>alsosubscribetothisidea.Whence<br>its credibility: it has the means to become a reality, and that is all<br>the proof it needs. This is what Horkheimer called the &ldquo;paranoia&rdquo; of<br>reason.42</p><p>39</p><p>But this realism of systemic self-regulation, and this perfectly<br>sealed circle of facts and interpretations, can be judged paranoid only<br>if one has, or claims to have, at one&rsquo;s disposal a viewpoint that is in<br>principle immune from their allure. This is the function of the prin-ciple of class struggle in theories of society based on the work of<br>Marx.</p><p>39</p><p>&ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; theory is always in danger of being incorporated<br>into the programming of the social whole as a simple tool for the<br>optimization of its performance; this is because its desire for a uni-tary and totalizing truth lends itself to the unitary and totalizing<br>practice of the system&rsquo;s managers. &ldquo;Critical&rdquo; theory,43<br>based onÂ <br>aprinciple of dualism and wary of syntheses and reconciliations,<br>should be in a position to avoid this fate. What guides Marxism, then,<br>is a different model of society, and a different conception of the<br>function of the knowledge that can be produced by society and<br>acquired from it. This model was born of the struggles accompanying<br>the process of capitalism&rsquo;s encroachment upon traditional civilTHE POSTMODERN CONDITION D 13<br>societies. There is insufficient space here to chart the vicissitudes of<br>these struggles, which fill more than a century of social, political, and<br>ideological history. We will have to content ourselves with a glance at<br>the balance sheet, which is possible for us to tally today now that<br>their fate is known: in countries with liberal or advanced liberal<br>management, the struggles and their instruments have been trans-formed into regulators of the system; in communist countries, the<br>totalizing model and its totalitarian effect have made a comeback in<br>the name of Marxism itself, and the struggles in question have simply<br>been deprived of the right to exist.44<br>Everywhere, the Critique of<br>political economy (the subtitle of Marx&rsquo;sCapital)and its correlate,<br>the critique of alienated society, are used in one way or another as<br>aids in programming the system.45</p><p>40</p><p>Of course, certain minorities, such as the Frankfurt School or the<br>group Socialisme ou barbarie,46 preserved and refined the critical<br>model in opposition to this process. But the social foundation of the<br>principle of division, or class struggle, was blurred to the point of<br>losing all of its radicality; we cannot conceal the fact that the critical<br>model in the end lost its theoretical standing and was reduced to the<br>status of a &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; or &ldquo;hope,&ldquo;47<br>a token protest raised in the name<br>of man or reason or creativity, or again of some social categoryÂ <br>â€”suchastheThirdWorldorthestudents48â€”on which is conferred in<br>extremis the henceforth improbable function of critical subject.</p><p>40</p><p>The sole purpose of this schematic (or skeletal) reminder has been<br>to specify the problematic in which I intend to frame the question of<br>knowledge in advanced industrial societies. For it is impossible to<br>know what the state of knowledge isâ€”in other words, the problems<br>its development and distribution are facing todayâ€”without knowing<br>something of the society within which it is situated. And today more<br>than ever, knowing about that society involves first of all choosing<br>what approach the inquiry will take, and that necessarily means<br>choosing how society can answer. One can decide that the principal<br>role of knowledge is as an indispensable element in the functioning<br>of society, and act in accordance with that decision, only if one has<br>already decided that society is a giant machine.49</p><p>40</p><p>Conversely, one can count on its critical function, and orient its<br>development and distribution in that direction, only after it has been<br>decided that society does not form an integrated whole, but remains<br>haunted by a principle of opposition.50<br>The alternative seems clear:<br>it is a choice between the homogeneity and the intrinsic duality of<br>the social, between functional and critical knowledge. But the deci-sion seems difficult, or arbitrary.</p><p>41</p><p>It is tempting to avoid the decision altogether by distinguishing<br>two kinds of knowledge. One, the positivist kind, would be directly<br>applicable to technologies bearing on men and materials, and would<br>lend itself to operating as an indispensable productive force within<br>the system. The otherâ€”the critical, reflexive, or hermeneutic kindÂ <br>â€”by reflecting directly or indirectly on values or aims, would resist any<br>such &ldquo;recuperation.&ldquo;51</p><p>41</p><ol start=5><li>The Nature of the Social Bond:<br>The Postmodern Perspecti</li></ol><p>41</p><p>I find this partition solution unacceptable. I suggest that the alterna-tive it attempts to resolve, but only reproduces, is no longer relevant<br>for the societies with which we are concerned and that the solution<br>itself is still caught within a type of oppositional thinking that is out<br>of step with the most vital modes of postmodern knowledge. AsÂ <br>Ihave already said, economic &ldquo;redeployment&rdquo; in the current phase of<br>capitalism, aided by a shift in techniques and technology, goes hand<br>in hand with a change in the function of the State: the image of soci-ety this syndrome suggests necessitates a serious revision of the alter-nate approaches considered. For brevity&rsquo;s sake, suffice it to say that<br>functions of regulation, and therefore of reproduction, are being and<br>will be further withdrawn from administrators and entrusted to<br>machines. Increasingly, the central question is becoming who will<br>have access to the information these machines must have in storage<br>to guarantee that the right decisions are made. Access to data is, and<br>will continue to be, the prerogative of experts of all stripes. The rul-ing class is and will continue to be the class of decision makers. Even<br>now it is no longer composed of the traditional political class, but<br>of a composite layer of corporate leaders, high-level administrators,<br>and the heads of the major professional, labor, political, and religious<br>organizations.52</p><p>41</p><p>What is new in all of this is that the old poles of attraction repre-sented by nation-states, parties, professions, institutions, and histori-cal traditions are losing their attraction.

The<br>Trilateral Commission is not a popular pole of attraction. &ldquo;Identify-ing&rdquo; with the great names, the heroes of contemporary history, is<br>becoming more and more difficult.53<br>Dedicating oneself to &ldquo;catching<br>up with Germany,&rdquo; the life goal the French president [Giscard<br>d&rsquo;Estaing at the time this book was published in France] seems to<br>be offering his countrymen, is not exactly exicting. But then again,THE POSTMODERN CONDITION D 15<br>it is not exactly a life goal. It depends on each individual&rsquo;s industri-ousness. Each individual is referred to himself. And each of us knows<br>that ourselfdoes not amount to much.54</p><p>42</p><p>This breaking up of the grand Narratives (discussed below, sections<br>9 and 10) leads to what some authors analyze in terms of the dissolu-tion of the social bond and the disintegration of social aggregates<br>into a mass of individual atoms thrown into the absurdity of Brownian<br>motion.55<br>Nothing of the kind is happening: this point of view, it<br>seems to me, is haunted by the paradisaic representation of a lost<br>&ldquo;organic&rdquo; society.</p><p>42</p><p>Aselfdoes not amount to much, but no self is an island; each<br>exists in a fabric of relations that is now more complex and mobile<br>than ever before. Young or old, man or woman, rich or poor, a per-son is always located at &ldquo;nodal points&rdquo; of specific communication<br>circuits, however tiny these may be.56<br>Or better: one is always<br>located at a post through which various kinds of messages pass. No<br>one, not even the least privileged among us, is ever entirely powerless<br>over the messages that traverse and position him at the post of sender,<br>addressee, or referent. One&rsquo;s mobility in relation to these language<br>game effects (language games, of course, are what this is all about)<br>is tolerable, at least within certain limits (and the limits are vague);<br>it is even solicited by regulatory mechanisms, and in particular by<br>the self-adjustments the system undertakes in order to improve its<br>performance. It may even be said that the system can and must<br>encourage such movement to the extent that it combats its own<br>entropy; the novelty of an unexpected &ldquo;move,&rdquo; with its correlative<br>displacement of a partner or group of partners, can supply the<br>system with that increased performativity it forever demands and<br>consumes.57</p><p>42</p><p>It should now be clear from which perspective I chose language<br>games as my general methodological approach. I am not claiming<br>t<br>hat the entirety of social relations is of this natureâ€”that will remainan open question. But there is no need to resort to some fiction of<br>social origins to establish that language games are the minimum rela-tion required for society to exist: even before he is born, if only by<br>virtue of the name he is given, the human child is already positioned<br>as the referent in the story recounted by those around him, in rela-tion to which he will inevitably chart his course.58<br>Or more simply<br>still, the question of the social bond, insofar as it is a question, is<br>itself a language game, the game of inquiry. It immediately positions<br>the person who asks, as well as the addressee and the referent asked<br>about: it is already the social bond.</p><p>43</p><p>On the other hand, in a society whose communication component<br>is becoming more prominent day by day, both as a reality and as an<br>issue,59<br>it is clear that language assumes a new importance.

If the problem is described simply in<br>terms of communication theory, two things are overlooked: first,<br>messages have quite different forms and effects depending on whether<br>they are, for example, denotatives, prescriptives, evaluatives, per-formatives, etc. It is clear that what is important is not simply the<br>fact that they communicate information. Reducing them to this<br>function is to adopt an outlook which unduly privileges the system&rsquo;s<br>own interests and point of view. A cybernetic machine does indeed<br>run on information, but the goals programmed into it, for example,<br>originate in prescriptive and evaluative statements it has no way to<br>correct in the course of its functioningâ€”for example, maximizing<br>its own performance. How can one guarantee that performance<br>maximization is the best goal for the social system in every case? In<br>any case the &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; forming its matter are competent to handle<br>statements such as theseâ€”and this question in particula</p><p>43</p><p>Second, the trivial cybernetic version of information theory misses<br>something of decisive importance, to which I have already called at-tention: the agonistic aspect of society. The atoms are placed at the<br>crossroads of pragmatic relationships, but they are also displaced by<br>the messages that traverse them, in perpetual motion. Each language<br>partner, when a &ldquo;move&rdquo; pertaining to him is made, undergoesÂ <br>a"displacement,&rdquo; an alteration of some kind that not only affects him<br>in his capactiy as addressee and referent, but also as sender. These<br>&ldquo;moves&rdquo; necessarily provoke &ldquo;countermoves&rdquo; â€”and everyone knows<br>that a countermove that is merely reactional is not a &ldquo;good&rdquo; move.<br>Reactional countermoves are no more than programmed effects in<br>the opponent&rsquo;s strategy; they play into his hands and thus have no<br>effect on the balance of power.

We know today that the limits the institution im-poses on potential language &ldquo;moves&rdquo; are never established once and<br>for all (even if they have been formally defined).63<br>Rather, the limits<br>are themselves the stakes and provisional results of language strate-gies, within the institution and without. Examples: Does the univer-sity have a place for language experiments (poetics)? Can you tell<br>stories in a cabinet meeting? Advocate a cause in the barracks? The<br>answers are clear: yes, if the university opens creative workshops;<br>yes, if the cabinet works with prospective scenarios; yes, if the limits<br>of the old institution are displaced.64<br>Reciprocally, it can be said that<br>the boundaries only stabilize when they cease to be stakes in the<br>game.<br>This, I think, is the appropriate approach to contemporary institu-tions of knowledge.</p><p>45</p><ol start=6><li>The Pragmatics of Narrative Knowled</li></ol><p>45</p><p>In Section 1, I leveled two objections against the unquestioning ac-ceptance of an instrumental conception of knowledge in the most<br>highly developed societies. Knowledge is not the same as science, es-pecially in its contemporary form; and science, far from successfully<br>obscuring the problem of its legitimacy, cannot avoid raising it with<br>all of its implications, which are no less sociopolitical than episte-mological. Let us begin with an analysis of the nature of &ldquo;narrative&rdquo;<br>knowledge; by providing a point of comparison, our examination will<br>clarify at least some of the characteristics of the form assumed by<br>scientific knowledge in contemporary society. In addition, it will aid<br>us in understanding how the question of legitimacy is raised or fails<br>to be raised toda</p><p>45</p><p>Knowledge [savoir] in general cannot be reduced to science, nor<br>even to learning[connaissance] .Learning is the set of statements<br>which, to the exclusion of all other statements, denote or describe<br>objects and may be declared true or false.65<br>Science is a subset of<br>learning. It is also composed of denotative statements, but imposes<br>two supplementary conditions on their acceptability: the objects to<br>which they refer must be available for repeated access, in other<br>words, they must be accessible in explicit conditions of observation;<br>and it must be possible to decide whether or not a given statement<br>pertains to the language judged relevant by the experts.66</p><p>45</p><p>B<br>ut what is meant by the term knowledge is not only a set ofdenotative statements, far from it. It also includes notions of &ldquo;know-how,&rdquo; &ldquo;knowing how to live,&rdquo; &ldquo;how to listen&rdquo; [savoir-faire, savoir-vivre, savoir-ecouter] , etc. Knowledge, then, is a question of compe-tence that goes beyond the simple determination and application of<br>the criterion of truth, extending to the determination and applica-tion of criteria of efficiency (technical qualification), of justice and/<br>or happiness (ethical wisdom), of the beauty of a sound or color<br>(auditory and visual sensibility), etc. Understood in this way, know-ledge is what makes someone capable of forming &ldquo;good&rdquo; denotative<br>utterances, but also &ldquo;good&rdquo; prescriptive and &ldquo;good&rdquo; evaluative<br>utterances. &mldr; It is not a competence relative to a particular class<br>of statements (for example, cognitive ones) to the exclusion of all<br>others. On the contrary, it makes &ldquo;good&rdquo; performances in relation to<br>a variety of objects of discourse possible: objects to be known, de-cided on, evaluated, transformed. . . . From this derives one of the<br>principal features of knowledge: it coincides with an extensive arrayTHE POSTMODERN CONDITION Q 19<br>of competence-building measures and is the only form embodied in<br>a subject constituted by the various areas of competence composing<br>it.</p><p>46</p><p>Another characteristic meriting special attention is the relation<br>between this kind of knowledge and custom. What is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; pre-scriptive or evaluative utterance, a &ldquo;good&rdquo; performance in denotative<br>or technical matters? They are all judged to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; because they<br>conform to the relevant criteria (of justice, beauty, truth, and effi-ciency respectively) accepted in the social circle of the &ldquo;knower&rsquo;s&rdquo;<br>interlocutors. The early philosophers called this mode of legitimating<br>statements opinion.67<br>The consensus that permits such knowledge to<br>be circumscribed and makes it possible to distinguish one who knows<br>from one who doesn&rsquo;t (the foreigner, the child) is what constitutes<br>the culture of a people.68</p><p>46</p><p>This brief reminder of what knowledge can be in the way of train-ing and culture draws on ethnological description for its justifica-tion.69<br>But anthropological studies and literature that take rapidly<br>developing societies as their object can attest to the survival of this<br>type of knowledge within them, at least in some of their sectors.70<br>The very idea of development presupposes a horizon of nondevelop-ment where, it is assumed, the various areas of competence remain<br>enveloped in the unity of a tradition and are not differentiated ac-cording to separate qualifications subject to specific innovations, de-bates, and inquiries. This opposition does not necessarily implyÂ <br>adifference in nature between &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; and &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; man,71<br>but is compatible with the premise of a formal identity between &ldquo;the<br>savage mind&rdquo; and scientific thought;72<br>it is even compatible with the<br>(apparently contrary) premise of the superiority of customary know-ledge over the contemporary dispersion of competence.73</p><p>46</p><p>It is fair to say that there is one point on which all of the investiga-tions agree, regardless of which scenario they propose to dramatize<br>and understand the distance separating the customary state of know-ledge from its state in the scientific age: the preeminence of the<br>narrative form in the formulation of traditional knowledge. Some<br>study this form for its own sake;74<br>others see it as the diachronic<br>costume of the structural operators that, according to them, properly<br>constitute the knowledge in question;75<br>still others bring to it an<br>&ldquo;economic&rdquo; interpretation in the Freudian sense of the term.76<br>All<br>that is important here is the fact that its form is narrative. Narration<br>is the quintessential form of customary knowledge, in more ways<br>than on</p><p>46</p><p>First, the popular stories themselves recount what could be called20 D THE POSTMODERN CONDITION<br>positive or negative apprenticeships(Bildungen):in other words, the<br>successes or failures greeting the hero&rsquo;s undertakings. These successes<br>or failures either bestow legitimacy upon social institutions (the<br>function of myths), or represent positive or negative models (the<br>successful or unsuccessful hero) of integration into established insti-tutions (legends and tales). Thus the narratives allow the society in<br>which they are told, on the one hand, to define its criteria of compe-tence and, on the other, to evaluate according to those criteria what<br>is performed or can be performed within it.</p><p>47</p><p>Second, the narrative form, unlike the developed forms of the dis-course of knowledge, lends itself to a great variety of language games.<br>Denotative statements concerning, for example, the state of the sky<br>and the flora and fauna easily slip in; so do deontic statements pre-scribing what should be done with respect to these same referents, or<br>with respect to kinship, the difference between the sexes, children,<br>neighbors, foreigners, etc. Interrogative statements are implied, for<br>example, in episodes involving challenges (respond to a question,<br>choose one from a number of things); evaluative statements also<br>enter in, etc. The areas of competence whose criteria the narrative<br>supplies or applies are thus tightly woven together in the web it<br>forms, ordered by the unified viewpoint characteristic of this kind of<br>knowledge.</p><p>47</p><p>We shall examine in somewhat more detail a third property,<br>which relates to the transmission of narratives. Their narration<br>usually obeys rules that define the pragmatics of their transmission.Â <br>Ido not mean to say that a given society institutionally assigns the<br>role of narrator to certain categories on the basis of age, sex, or<br>family or professional group. What I am getting at is a pragmatics of<br>popular narratives that is, so to speak, intrinsic to them. For example,<br>aCashinahua77<br>torytelleralwaysbeginshisnarrationwithafixed<br>formula: &ldquo;Here is the story ofâ€”, as I&rsquo;ve always heard it told. I will<br>tell it to you in my turn. Listen.&rdquo; And he brings it to a close with<br>another, also invariable, formula: &ldquo;Here ends the story ofâ€”. The<br>man who has told it to you isâ€” (Cashinahua name), or to the<br>Whitesâ€” (Spanish or Portuguese name).&ldquo;78</p><p>47</p><p>A quick analysis of this double pragmatic instruction reveals the<br>following: the narrator&rsquo;s only claim to competence for telling the<br>story is the fact that he has heard it himself. The current narratee<br>gains potential access to the same authority simply by listening. It is<br>claimed that the narrative is a faithful transmission (even if the narra-tive performance is highly inventive) and that it has been told &ldquo;for-ever&rdquo;: therefore the hero, a Cashinahuan, was himself once a narratee,THE POSTMODERN CONDITION D 21<br>and perhaps a narrator, of the very same story. This similarity of con-dition allows for the possibility that the current narrator could be<br>the hero of a narrative,just as the Ancestor was. In fact,he is necessarily<br>such ahero because he bears a name,declined atthe end of his narration,<br>and that name was given to him in conformity with the canonic narrative<br>legitimating the assignment of patronyms among the Cashinahu</p><p>48</p><p>The pragmatic rule illustrated by this example cannot, of course,<br>be universalized.79<br>But it gives insight into what is a generally recog-nized property of traditional knowledge. The narrativeÂ <br>&ldquo;posts&rdquo;(sender, addressee, hero) are so organized that the right to occupy<br>the post of sender receives the following double grounding: it is<br>based upon the fact of having occupied the post of addressee, and of<br>having been recounted oneself, by virtue of the name one bears, byÂ <br>aprevious narrativeâ€”in other words, having been positioned as the<br>diegetic reference of other narrative events.80<br>The knowledge trans-mitted by these narrations is in no way limited to the functions of<br>enunciation; it determines in a single stroke what one must say in<br>order to be heard, what one must listen to in order to speak, and<br>what role one must play (on the scene of diegetic reality) to be the<br>object of a narrativ</p><p>48</p><p>Thusthespeechacts81<br>relevanttothisformofknowledgeareper-formed not only by the speaker, but also by the listener, as well as<br>by the third party referred to. The knowledge arising from such an<br>apparatus may seem &ldquo;condensed&rdquo; in comparison with what I call<br>&ldquo;developed&rdquo; knowledge. Our example clearly illustrates that a narra-tive tradition is also the tradition of the criteria defining a threefold<br>competence â€”&ldquo;know-how,&rdquo; &ldquo;knowing how to speak,&rdquo; and &ldquo;knowing<br>how to hear&rdquo; [savoir-faire, savoir-dire, savoir-entendre] â€”through<br>which the community&rsquo;s relationship to itself and its environment is<br>played out. What is transmitted through these narratives is the set of<br>pragmatic rules that constitutes the social bon</p><p>48</p><p>A fourth aspect of narrative knowledge meriting careful examina-tion is its effect on time. Narrative form follows a rhythm; it is the<br>synthesis of a meter beating time in regular periods and of accent<br>modifying the length or amplitude of certain of those periods.82<br>This<br>vibratory, musical property of narrative is clearly revealed in the<br>ritual performance of certain Cashinahua tales: they are handed<br>down in initiation ceremonies, in absolutely fixed form, in a language<br>whose meaning is obscured by lexical and syntactic anomalies, and<br>they are sung as interminable, monotonous chants.83<br>It is a strange<br>brand of knowledge, you may say, that does not even make itself<br>understood to the young men to whom it is addressed!</p><p>49</p><p>And yet this kind of knowledge is quite common; nursery rhymes<br>are of this type, and repetitive forms of contemporary music have<br>tried to recapture or at least approximate it. It exhibits a surprising<br>feature: as meter takes precedence over accent in the production of<br>sound (spoken or not), time ceases to be a support for memory to<br>become an immemorial beating that, in the absence of a noticeable<br>separation between periods, prevents their being numbered and con-signs them to oblivion.84<br>Consider the form of popular sayings, pro-verbs, and maxims: they are like little splinters of potential narratives,<br>or molds of old ones, which have continued to circulate on certain<br>levels of the contemporary social edifice. In their prosody can be<br>recognized the mark of that strange temporalization that jars the<br>golden rule of our knowledge: &ldquo;never forget.&rdquo;</p><p>49</p><p>Now there must be a congruence between this lethal function of<br>narrative knowledge and the functions, cited earlier, of criteria for-mation, the unification of areas of competence, and social regulation.<br>By way of a simplifying fiction, we can hypothesize that, against all<br>expectations, a collectivity that takes narrative as its key form of<br>competence has no need to remember its past. It finds the raw ma-terial for its social bond not only in the meaning of the narratives it<br>recounts, but also in the act of reciting them. The narratives&rsquo; refer-ence may seem to belong to the past, but in reality it is always con-temporaneous with the act of recitation. It is the present act that on<br>each of its occurrences marshals in the ephemeral temporality in-habiting the space between the &ldquo;I have heard&rdquo; and the &ldquo;you will<br>hear.&rdquo;</p><p>49</p><p>The important thing about the pragmatic protocol of this kind of<br>narration is that it betokens a theoretical identity between each of<br>the narrative&rsquo;s occurrences. This may not in fact be the case, and<br>often is not, and we should not blind ourselves to the element of<br>humor or anxiety noticeable in the respect this etiquette inspires.<br>The fact remains that what is emphasized is the metrical beat of the<br>narrative occurrences, not each performance&rsquo;s differences in accent.<br>It is in this sense that this mode of temporality can be said to be si-multaneously evanescent and immemorial.85</p><p>49</p><p>Finally, a culture that gives precedence to the narrative form<br>doubtless has no more of a need for special procedures to authorize<br>its narratives than it has to remember its past. It is hard to imagine<br>such a culture first isolating the post of narrator from the others in<br>order to give it a privileged status in narrative pragmatics, then in-quiring into what right the narrator (who is thus disconnected from<br>the narratee and diegesis) might have to recount what he recounts,THE POSTMODERN CONDITION P 23<br>and finally undertaking the analysis or anamnesis of its own legiti-macy. It is even harder to imagine it handing over the authority for<br>its narratives to some incomprehensible subject of narration. The<br>narratives themselves have this authority. In a sense, the people are<br>only that which actualizes the narratives: once again, they do this<br>not only by recounting them, but also by listening to them and re-counting themselves through them; in other words, by putting them<br>into &ldquo;play&rdquo; in their institutionsâ€”thus by assigning themselves the<br>posts of narratee and diegesis as well as the post of narrato</p><p>50</p><p>There is, then, an incommensurability between popular narrative<br>pragmatics, which provides immediate legitimation, and the language<br>game known to the West as the question of legitimacy â€”or rather,<br>legitimacy as a referent in the game of inquiry. Narratives, as we have<br>seen, determine criteria of competence and/or illustrate how they are<br>to be applied. They thus define what has the right to be said and<br>done in the culture in question, and since they are themselves a part<br>of that culture, they are legitimated by the simple fact that they do<br>what they do.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/Metabolical-The-Lure-and-the-Lies-of-Processed-Food-Nutrition-and-Modern-Medicine/ data-ctx="Inbox scrap 63" data-src=/Metabolical-The-Lure-and-the-Lies-of-Processed-Food-Nutrition-and-Modern-Medicine class=internal-link>Metabolical The Lure and the Lies of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine</a></li><li><a href=/The-Postmodern-Condition/ data-ctx="Inbox scrap 63" data-src=/The-Postmodern-Condition class=internal-link>The Postmodern Condition</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#D0A4FF}</style><script src=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bryce Mcalister using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com>Home</a></li><li><a href></a></li><li><a href></a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
