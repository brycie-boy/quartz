To paraphrase Hume, I never observe &ldquo;my mind&rdquo;—much less &ldquo;the mind&rdquo; or &ldquo;mind&rdquo; in general. All I ever observe or experience is mental state1, mental state2, mental state3 etc. And we never observe &ldquo;matter&rdquo; either, but only sense datum1, sense datum2 etc.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 181 · Location 3752</p><p>(Historically, as noted earlier, measurement1, measurement2 etc. led to the concept of &ldquo;that which is measured&rdquo; which seems to be what &ldquo;matter&rdquo; means etymologically. The metaphoric nature of this is seen when we remember how Plato derived from chicken coop1, chicken coop2 etc. the Eternal Chicken Coop.)</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 182 · Location 3761</p><p>Psychosomatic metaphors seem more and more useful to physicians, psychiatrists and social scientists. Evidence accumulates that what people think and feel can make them ill, and that thinking/ feeling in different modalities can make them well again. This is &ldquo;explained&rdquo; by invoking a vague &ldquo;psychosomatic unity&rdquo; or, increasingly, by bluntly admitting that the old models of &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;matter&rdquo; cannot explain the data and calling for a new holistic model in which &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;matter&rdquo; will be integrated as neatly as Einstein integrated &ldquo;space&rdquo; and &ldquo;time&rdquo; into &ldquo;space-time.&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 182 · Location 3766</p><p>Behavioral scientists note also that there seems to be a great utility (pragmatic value) in models that regard &ldquo;my&rdquo; &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; &ldquo;mind&rdquo; as aspects of a social field and not as isolated, block-like entities of the Aristotelian sort.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 182 · Location 3767</p><p>Every version of the Copenhagen Interpretation either says explicitly or at least implies that &ldquo;experimental reality&rdquo; is a synergy including the experimenter and not the old philosophical &ldquo;reality&rdquo; &ldquo;outside&rdquo; and &ldquo;apart from&rdquo; us.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 182 · Location 3770</p><p>One school of psychologists observes that, just as &ldquo;mind&rdquo; influences &ldquo;body&rdquo; in psychosomatic effects, so, too, &ldquo;body&rdquo; affects &ldquo;mind&rdquo; in many cases where, for instance, chronic tension of the muscles produces habitual negative &ldquo;mental states&rdquo; of worry or anger, etc. and relaxing the muscles eases the &ldquo;mental&rdquo; tension.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 182 · Location 3772</p><p>Another school of psychologists observes that there is no &ldquo;neurotic&rdquo; or &ldquo;psychotic&rdquo; individual who does not appear to be part of a social field of habitual anxieties or evasions.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 182 · Location 3774</p><p>Thus, &ldquo;mind&rdquo; merges into &ldquo;matter&rdquo; in some models, &ldquo;matter&rdquo; merges into &ldquo;mind&rdquo; in others, and &ldquo;mind&rdquo; becomes more and more a thing that cannot be adequately modelled at all without including the social field around it. And what sort of thing—&ldquo;mental&rdquo; or &ldquo;material&rdquo;—is a social field, by the way?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 185 · Location 3828</p><p>Unless, in a &ldquo;mind-matter&rdquo; continuum, or a continuum in which &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;matter&rdquo; sometimes act separately and sometimes act synergetically—some things we tune in are more &ldquo;mental&rdquo; than &ldquo;material,&rdquo; and some more &ldquo;material&rdquo; than &ldquo;mental&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 185 · Location 3836</p><p>No: despite Charles Fort&rsquo;s cynicism, I don&rsquo;t care to attribute these appearances to a particularly tricky &ldquo;God&rdquo;—especially when an appearance has apparently killed 1500 people. But I do think, heretically and &ldquo;dangerously,&rdquo; of non-local effects, of the &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; in between &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; in Quantum Logic, of &ldquo;solid&rdquo; &ldquo;objects&rdquo; that are superimpositions of waves, according to one quantum model, and of &ldquo;minds&rdquo; that are superimpositions of waves if the &ldquo;minds&rdquo; are transactions involving brains and the brains are made of cells which are made of atoms which are made of electrons which are superimpositions of waves.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 185 · Location 3845</p><p>If &ldquo;God&rdquo; is not mad, as Fort claimed, then maybe &ldquo;God&rdquo; is, as Buckminster Fuller once wrote, not a noun but a verb. That is, &ldquo;God&rdquo; is what religious people do, as, in some models, an electron is an operation performed by people (physicists)—&ldquo;God&rdquo; as the act of praying, the energy raised</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 186 · Location 3857</p><p>We can all be glad that the word &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; exists. Otherwise the Materialist Fundamentalists would find these stories just as puzzling and frightening as the Religious Fundamentalists will find them. Good old &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo;—once we think of it, we can banish the puzzlement and the fear at once, and forget these stories. Mention &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; a few more times and you can forget most of the disturbing side of most of our stories. Just keep thinking &ldquo;coincidence, coincidence, coincidence&rdquo;; you&rsquo;ll find it wonderfully soothing, as Nietzsche would say.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 187 · Location 3875</p><p>September 1982 Science Digest p. 88—the smallest unit now scientifically recognized is 10-23 seconds. There&rsquo;s that damned 23 again. And this time it sneaked its way into Science Digest, of all places. The context—for those of us deranged enough to continue at this point—is even more interesting. Science Digest, op. cit. still p. 88—&ldquo;The Delta-1232, for example, created when a photon and a pi-meson collide, exists for only 0.66 x 10-23 seconds. Is it only a coincidence that the lifetimes of such particles are nearly always close multiples of the chronon?&rdquo; (The chronon is the above-mentioned 10-23 seconds.)</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 187 · Location 3885</p><p>Is it only a coincidence that they ask &ldquo;is it only a coincidence?&rdquo; when I am thinking &ldquo;is it only a coincidence?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the kind of question that got Carl Jung thinking about synchronicity (universal resonance) which is a little bit like Sheldrake&rsquo;s morphogenetic field and also, coincidentally, a little bit like the non-local effect in quantum mechanics.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 187 · Location 3889</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been collecting mysterious 23s for a number of years—and not to annoy the Fundamentalists, but to annoy myself, which is how I provoke myself into thought, or at least into neurological reactions which sometimes are not totally mechanical and predictable.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 188 · Location 3916</p><p>Arthur Koestler, Aleister Hardy and Robert Harvie, The Challenge of Chance—Hardy, a biologist, and Harvie, a psychologist, performed one of the most massive tests of so-called ESP ever accomplished. The subjects scored well above chance, which often happens and means that something is being measured, according to the testers, or else that the testers are incompetent or worse, according to the Fundamentalists. But this time, before the Fundamentalists could criticize the data, Harvie and Hardy shuffled the response cards at random, to see if results that far above chance could be obtained &ldquo;by accident&rdquo; (aleotorically). They found correlations so far above chance that they were stunned, as was Koestler, the philosopher, when they showed him the data.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 189 · Location 3923</p><p>All three of them interpret this result as very damaging to previous &ldquo;ESP” research—as I do also—but they further argue that it also casts doubt on our traditional ideas of causality. They suggest that some sort of &ldquo;formative&rdquo; or &ldquo;organizing&rdquo; principle is at work in such appearances of order out of chaos (randomness).</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 189 · Location 3940</p><p>In a letter from Robert Rickard, co-author of Phenomena and co-editor of Fortean Times—William Blake, the first great critic of Fundamentalist Materialism, lived at 23 Hercules Street, Lambert; the Turin shroud, which allegedly contains the image of Jesus, is kept at a constant 23 ° Centigrade.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 190 · Location 3946</p><p>It is quite safe to expect, on the basis of past experience, that you will notice some peculiar 23s in the next few days. Such is the contagion of this phenomenon—or, as the Fundamentalist would say, such is the power of suggestion and the sinister ability of the forces of Unreason to seduce us.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 190 · Location 3952</p><p>&ldquo;Coincidence, coincidence, coincidence&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 190 · Location 3952</p><p>it&rsquo;s a lovely word. If you repeat it over and over, and over, and over, it will work exactly like a Hindu mantra: it will quiet anxieties and suppress doubts; it will relax and soothe you; and it will finally stop thought entirely.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 190 · Location 3955</p><p>On a recent tour I was approached, after a lecture in St. Louis, by a fan who told me he had figured out how the &ldquo;23 gimmick&rdquo; works—why so many readers of my books encounter dramatic 23s while reading them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a neurological grid,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You set up the expectation, and then we notice the 23s more than ordinary numbers.&rdquo; I congratulated him on his perceptivity. Indeed, that is one of my major messages, in everything I write—our emic realities are programmed by our expectations. You are the &ldquo;Master who makes the grass green.&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 190 · Location 3962</p><p>Then this chap invited me out to dinner with himself and his wife. I was in no mood for a real dinner; after a lecture, I want junk food and beer. We went to a fast-food Pizza joint, of the sort that gives you a ticket with a number to hold and then calls the number when your pizza is ready. Our number, of course, was 23. &ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo; asked my friend, confused again. And—&ldquo;My God,&rdquo; asked Picasso, &ldquo;is she really that small?&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 190 · Location 3967</p><p>More recently I was giving a seminar in Amsterdam and took the opportunity to visit the Van Gogh museum. Walking past one astounding &ldquo;psychedelic&rdquo; canvas after another, I marveled again at the marvelous reality-labyrinth Van Gogh offers us—his multiple vision, his poetry, his creative acts of seeing. I realized again that, just as Van Gogh &ldquo;is&rdquo; great precisely because he did not copy Rembrandt&rsquo;s reality-tunnels, and Picasso &ldquo;is&rdquo; great because he did not copy Van Gogh, and Mondrian &ldquo;is&rdquo; great because he did not copy Picasso, etc., all &ldquo;greatness&rdquo; in art is a new synergy, a new transaction between &ldquo;observer&rdquo; and &ldquo;observed.&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 191 · Location 3974</p><p>I suddenly remembered that Adolph Hitler once said that &ldquo;anybody who paints the sky green should be sterilized at once.&rdquo; I thought I understood the Right Man more deeply. The Right Man stays in one reality-tunnel because wandering into the reality-labyrinth of the creative mind terrifies him.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 191 · Location 3979</p><p>Dr. Evan Harris Walker and Dr. Nick Herbert—in the anthology, Future Science, ed. by Dr. Stanley Krippner and John White, Doubleday, New York, 1976—propose a variation on Dr. David Bohm&rsquo;s theory of the implicate order—the enfolded order which Bohm proposed might underlie the explicate, unfolded order of &ldquo;space,&rdquo; &ldquo;time&rdquo; and &ldquo;matter.&rdquo; Bohm sometimes calls the implicate order a &ldquo;hidden variable&rdquo; which programs the explicate order. Drs. Herbert and Walker propose a &ldquo;hidden variable&rdquo; theory of what parapsychologists have hitherto vaguely called &ldquo;psychokinesis.&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 191 · Location 3984</p><p>I have discussed this model with Dr. Herbert—I haven&rsquo;t met Dr. Walker yet—and I think I understand what this model implies. The best way to introduce the subject, however, seems to be through a digression about two other friends and a further digression about Dr. Carl Sagan and Fundamentalist Materialism.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 191 · Location 3987</p><p>The two friends mentioned are Saul Paul Sirag, physicist, and Dr. Paul Segall, biologist. They have had a friendly argument going on for about twenty years about whether physics or biology is the more important science. Not unexpectedly, Sirag, the physicist, votes for physics, and Segall, the biologist, casts his ballot for biology. The essence of the argument is more or less this:</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 191 · Location 3990</p><p>The brain, according to Dr. Segall, produces all our ideas, including our best scientific models. When we understand the brain fully, we will understand how ideas, including scientific models, are produced, and even how to produce such models more efficiently and creatively. Biology is the science most likely to achieve this; ergo, biology is the most important science.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 192 · Location 3994</p><p>Sirag argues that the brain, which does these wonderful things, is made of cells, which are made of molecules, which are made of atoms, which are made of the fascinating thingamajigs (&rdquo; particles" and/ or &ldquo;waves&rdquo;) that are studied in quantum mechanics. Ergo, to understand the brain fully, we must first understand quantum physics fully, and therefore physics is the most important science, even for a biologist.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 192 · Location 3998</p><p>Segall replies, Copenhagenishly, that the &ldquo;waves&rdquo; and &ldquo;particles&rdquo; etc. are still models generated by the brain, and so we must understand the brain as an entity before we can understand its models . . .</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 192 · Location 4000</p><p>And the argument, like Godel&rsquo;s Proof, vanishes into an infinite regress.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 192 · Location 4001</p><p>The Fundamentalist Materialist position has most recently been restated in elegant but popular form by Dr. Carl Sagan of CSICOP in his famous Dragons of Eden. The argument avoids the infinite regress by assuming that the brain can be understood entirely in terms of molecular chemistry. If this assumption is granted, then, obviously, &ldquo;mind&rdquo; is an epiphenomenon of &ldquo;matter&rdquo; (the molecules) and Fundamentalist Materialism is the sound philosophy for a scientist.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 192 · Location 4007</p><p>Of course, the heresy—or one of the heresies—of the present book is that Fundamentalist Materialism &ldquo;is&rdquo; pre-Einsteinian as well as pre-Quantum, in the sense that the technicians at Houston &ldquo;are&rdquo; temporarily relapsing into pre-Copernicanism every time they talk about &ldquo;up there.&rdquo; The Houston chaps, however, only relapse temporarily and (despite Fuller&rsquo;s warnings) remain post-Copernican most of the time (although I wonder about Challenger . . .). Fundamentalist Materialism, on the other hand, does appear, from our point of view, not a temporary lapse but a chronic neuro-semantic distemper. From a post-Einsteinian and post-Quantum perspective, &ldquo;molecules&rdquo; appear as—insofar as they &ldquo;are&rdquo; more useful scientific models than &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; or psychokinetic forces" or great lines of poetry—models that are to be understood within the larger models of bio-physics, including quantum mechanics.

Then, from in front of the first screen, flash a light toward the two holes.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 196 · Location 4096</p><p>This has been done many times, starting in the 19th Century. The pattern on the second screen—the pattern made by the light after passing through the two holes—will be consistent with the wave model of light.

They will also be consistent with the mathematical equations for such interference of waves.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 196 · Location 4100</p><p>According to the experiment in this form, both vision and mathematical analysis indicate that light &ldquo;really is&rdquo; waves and that each hole had its own separate waves coming through it.

There is no interference pattern, such as we found in the two-hole experiment. However, if we open both holes again—the two-hole experiment repeated—the wave pattern again appears, with its associated interference; an interference consistent with the wave model but mathematically inconsistent with the particle model.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 197 · Location 4111</p><p>It is &ldquo;as if&rdquo; light traveled in waves when it &ldquo;knew&rdquo; we were going to open both holes, but then decided to travel in particles when it &ldquo;knew&rdquo; we were going to open one hole or the other, or both successively, but not both simultaneously.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 197 · Location 4113</p><p>It has been tried experimentally to find out what the damned light would do if we tried to &ldquo;trick&rdquo; it by starting with two holes open and then quickly closing one of them when the light is in motion but has not yet reached the screen. It behaves in accord with the proper model consistent with the conditions at the instant when it arrives at the screen. That is, if one thinks of it &ldquo;really&rdquo; starting out as waves, to be consistent with the wave model, it &ldquo;discovers&rdquo; en route that we are &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; by changing from two holes to one, and it immediately changes itself to fit the particle model.
