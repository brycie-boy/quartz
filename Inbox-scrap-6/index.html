Ill), Hofstadter states that Velikovsky &ldquo;claimed his views reconciled science and the Bible.&rdquo; For all I know. Dr. Velikovsky did claim that, some time or other, but it is irrelevant to judgment about his claims for a variety of reasons:</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 86 ¬∑ Location 1699</p><ol><li>Newton also thought his model reconciled science and the Bible. Many others have had similar notions. The value of a model depends on its scientific utility, not on whether its spokespersons think it supports or contradicts the Bible.</li></ol><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 86 ¬∑ Location 1702</p><ol start=2><li>Those who think a scientific theory supports the Bible may be right or wrong; those who think a scientific theory contradicts the Bible may also be right or wrong. That is a tangled branch of scriptural exegesis and has nothing to do with the scientific validity of the theory itself.</li></ol><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 86 ¬∑ Location 1704</p><ol start=3><li>Many readers of Velikovsky, whom I have met, are not aware that he said, or is thought to have said, that his views support the Bible. These readers, who are not notably stupid, have rather an opposite impression. They think Velikovsky &ldquo;supports&rdquo; not the Bible but the general idea that some myths of all peoples are based on historical events. In other words, this group of readers did not get the message &ldquo;The Bible is true&rdquo; but the rather different message, &ldquo;Some myths contain some truth.&rdquo; This is hardly unthinkable; since the excavation of Troy, Homer is now recognized as containing some truth‚Äîsombunall.</li></ol><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 86 ¬∑ Location 1710</p><ol start=4><li>Bible Fundamentalists are as enraged at Velikovsky as the New Fundamentalists. His comet model explains (or tries to explain) events (or alleged events) which they prefer to explain with the &ldquo;God&rdquo; model. And, indeed, if we accept the &ldquo;comet&rdquo; model, we don&rsquo;t really need the &ldquo;God&rdquo; model in this case. An idea that creates equal fury in two opposed groups of Fundamentalists can only be considered propaganda for one of those groups by those members of the other group who are so Fundamentalistic that their prejudice totally obliterates ordinary reasoning in them.</li></ol><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 87 ¬∑ Location 1717</p><ol start=5><li>To proceed from &ldquo;Something like Noah&rsquo;s flood once happened&rdquo; to &ldquo;The whole Bible is true&rdquo; is not very logical, and I can&rsquo;t find anything like it in any book of Velikovsky&rsquo;s that I‚Äôve read; and it would be just as logical, and just as illogical, to proceed from &ldquo;Something like the Polynesian flood story once happened&rdquo; to &ldquo;The whole Polynesian mythology is true,&rdquo; and Velikovsky does not say that either as far as I have read him.</li></ol><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 88 ¬∑ Location 1738</p><p>cuss-words like &ldquo;pseudo-science,&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 89 ¬∑ Location 1771</p><p>The only answer I can see is that no speculation is obnoxious to an open mind but all new and challenging speculations are obnoxious to Fundamentalists.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 89 ¬∑ Location 1774</p><p>What I do care about is the threat to my own free speech‚Äîand yours‚Äîposed by the mentalities that tried so hard and so long to suppress Dr. Velikovsky&rsquo;s right to think and to publish.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 90 ¬∑ Location 1795</p><p>don&rsquo;t doubt that there &ldquo;are&rdquo; hallucinations, or things that can most usefully be modelled by the theory of hallucination, even dual hallucination and mass hallucination, but, once this is granted, why be selective with such labels? One witness sees a caterpillar turn into a butterfly‚Äîhallucination. Two witnesses see it‚Äîdual hallucination. Many, many witnesses‚Äîmass hallucination.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 91 ¬∑ Location 1801</p><p>If the Old Inquisition had been as semantically agile as the New Inquisition: Galileo sees spots on the sun‚Äîhallucination. Two more observers see the spots‚Äîdual hallucination. Many, many observers‚Äîmass hallucination.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 91 ¬∑ Location 1803</p><p>I don&rsquo;t see how science could grow if we did not occasionally admit that things which contradict old theories may be significant and may require new theories. Everything inconvenient cannot be dismissed as &ldquo;hallucination.&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 91 ¬∑ Location 1812</p><p>I am merely trying to show that, in the present primitive condition of this backward planet, we are still governed by imprinting and conditioning‚Äîthat all of us, like Mr. Gardner and Mr. Randi, find it literally impossible to think, even for a nanosecond, about certain ideas‚Äîthat you and I think we are more tolerant than Mr. Randi or Mr. Gardner until we confront that which is strictly intolerable for us‚Äî</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 92 ¬∑ Location 1824</p><p>It is accepted by all schools of philosophy that the world presents only appearances to us. Facts are deduced from the appearances, according to the various factions, by PR (pure reason) or by a combination of PR and SD (sense data) in tandem, or by PR and SD aided and abetted by creative intuition, but in any case, they are deduced, not given. Hume and Nietzsche seem to be alone in claiming that what is called a &ldquo;fact&rdquo; is just another appearance which somebody has decided to believe is a fact.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 94 ¬∑ Location 1871</p><p>No: it did not turn into a human. But, then, I am not trying to do anything else in this book except hold up a mirror to that part of human psychology in which anxiety increases perceptibly (or is replaced by anger) when we even approach the line at which Taboo might be broken. I am trying to show that every emic reality or mind-construct is a way of segregating appearances, so that those which fit our personal reality-tunnel can be accepted as &ldquo;real&rdquo; facts and those which do not fit are quickly discarded as &ldquo;only&rdquo; appearances.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 94 ¬∑ Location 1881</p><p>Try this multiple choice test:</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 94 ¬∑ Location 1882</p><p>Note - Page 94 ¬∑ Location 1882</p><p>Test</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 95 ¬∑ Location 1882</p><p>All appearances seem to be facts, at first, to those to whom they appear. If they are bizarre, if they don&rsquo;t fit our reality-tunnel, and if they go away quickly, we are happy to dismiss them as &ldquo;only&rdquo; appearances, or as misperceptions. If they keep coming back, we wonder about our sanity, or we eventually accept them as &ldquo;facts.&rdquo; As Norbert Wiener once said, the brain operates on Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s principle, &ldquo;What I tell you three times is true.&rdquo; Redundance is the great persuader. A fact allegedly exists; a non-fact allegedly doesn&rsquo;t exist. But existence is something we can never know all about. It is a term in metaphysics, not in operational science.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 95 ¬∑ Location 1891</p><p>It is awkward to think that bacilli and other small organisms did not exist until we invented microscopes to see them, or that other galaxies did not exist until, in the 1920s, we invented telescopes powerful enough to detect them. Similarly, the past does not exist any longer for us, in ordinary perception, but it exists‚Äîand so does the future‚Äîin the geometry of Minkowski&rsquo;s space-time continuum.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 95 ¬∑ Location 1894</p><p>Bucky Fuller has another pedantic suggestion we might consider at this point. Since &ldquo;existence&rdquo; appears to be either meaningless (scientifically indeterminate forever) or some kind of Game Rule in disguise, we should not talk about it at all, if we want to make sense. What we can talk about sensibly, Fuller says, is the tuned-in and the not-tuned-in. The microscopic world was not non-existent but not-tuned-in before we had microscopes. The beauty seen by a painter is not exactly non-existent for a money-oriented businessman but is not-tuned-in by him, because it is not relevant to his reality-tunnel. What I perceive at a moment is not necessarily real or existent, for others, but merely what I am tuning-in at that moment. It may be my favorite day-dream.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 95 ¬∑ Location 1904</p><p>If we talk always and only about the tuned-in and the non-tuned-in, we will make statements that are operationally and scientifically meaningful, although limited by our space-time coordinates. When we talk about existence and non-existence, on the other hand, we make statements that can never be totally confirmed and perhaps can never be totally refuted, which means we are making operationally meaningless statements.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 96 ¬∑ Location 1912</p><p>It is not impossible, however uncongenial the thought may be to the Citadel, that many &ldquo;unscientific&rdquo; reality-tunnels, explored by, say, painters, or poets, or musicians, or novelists, or &ldquo;mystics,&rdquo; may be not non-existent but merely not-tuned-in by those who have not practiced for many years in tuning-in painterly or poetic or musical or novelistic or &ldquo;mystical&rdquo; brain circuits.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 96 ¬∑ Location 1918</p><p>440 UFO-related automobile accidents are studied. There were two features in common among all these cases: Strange lights were seen in the sky. And the motors of the cars mysteriously malfunctioned. I will accept the lights as appearances, and as a neo-Humean I will even accept the motor failures as appearances in Hume&rsquo;s sense, but I suggest that any &ldquo;Scientific Materialist&rdquo; who accepts both motor failures and associated car accidents as appearances has gone a long way down the road toward the Buddhist doctrine of maya, which regards all data as appearances. At such a point, I fail to see much distinction at all between such a materialism and the most esoteric varieties of Oriental mysticism.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 97 ¬∑ Location 1934</p><p>The human mind is ingenious enough to prove or disprove any proposition, to its own satisfaction, if not to the conviction of those who lack the Faith to believe it.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 97 ¬∑ Location 1942</p><p>But I wonder why the whole subject is under such heavy Taboo and why so many of the New Fundamentalists not only reject the spaceship idea but reject the data as well and heap ridicule on anybody who reports such events.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 97 ¬∑ Location 1944</p><p>I have personally met 17 UFO witnesses. I didn&rsquo;t seek them out‚Äîit just happens I travel a lot and lecture a lot and thus meet a lot of people. All 17 told me they had not reported their sightings to the government or the press. When asked why, all 17 said they were afraid of being called crazy.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 98 ¬∑ Location 1946</p><p>So: I wonder‚Äîif the Center for UFO Studies found 440 cases of UFOs related to auto accidents, how many more such cases are there in which the witnesses were simply too prudent to talk about what they saw?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 98 ¬∑ Location 1948</p><p>And if people in many cases are afraid to talk of what they have experienced, is it really wicked satire to say there is an Inquisitorial spirit abroad in the world today?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 98 ¬∑ Location 1950</p><p>The Irish proverb quoted at the beginning‚Äî&ldquo;If you see a two-headed pig, keep your mouth shut&rdquo;‚Äîcontains profound pragmatic wisdom.
