Nietzsche, The Will to Power</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 213 ¬∑ Location 4458</p><p>Since the publication of Packard&rsquo;s The Hidden Persuaders, McLuhan&rsquo;s The Mechanical Bride, and similar books, it has been realized that techniques of inducing &ldquo;mass hallucination&rdquo; or something like &ldquo;mass hallucination&rdquo; are well known to advertisers.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 213 ¬∑ Location 4462</p><p>Almost all cigarette smokers, for instance, have a favorite brand and insist that they cannot be satisfied by any other brand. When blindfolded, however, they cannot distinguish this favorite brand from any other brand. They are not buying the cigarettes but buying the package. The same is true of most beer drinkers: they have a favorite brand, but cannot distinguish it from other brands when blindfolded.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 213 ¬∑ Location 4465</p><p>This species of &ldquo;mass hallucination&rdquo; has been created by conditioning and association. Each advertiser tries to associate his product with something most domesticated primates desire, such as Sex or Status. The commercials carry the association, sometimes fairly blatantly, sometimes subliminally.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 213 ¬∑ Location 4468</p><p>The repetition of the association gradually produces the conditioned response. The victim is not exactly &ldquo;buying the package&rdquo; as we just said but buying the hope for Sex and Status.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 213 ¬∑ Location 4470</p><p>Of course, the satisfaction of the smoker or drinker is just as &ldquo;real,&rdquo; within that conditioned reality-tunnel, as the meanings of a Rembrandt are within the traditional Western Art tunnel, or the meanings of a Van Gogh within the Impressionist tunnel, or the meanings of an African mask within that tribal tunnel, or the meanings of a Picasso within the Modernist tunnel, etc. All are equally unreal, also (or equally meaningless, to say it otherwise) to those who haven&rsquo;t learned or conditioned themselves to enter these tunnels.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 214 ¬∑ Location 4474</p><p>Existential or emic &ldquo;reality&rdquo;‚Äîthe reality of daily life‚Äîthe &ldquo;reality&rdquo; of experience, sensory-sensual &ldquo;reality,&rdquo; as distinguished from the assumed &ldquo;real&rdquo; &ldquo;reality&rdquo; of various philosophers‚Äîappears then to be too interactive and synergetic to reduce to Aristotelian either/ or choices. It fits more adequately into Buddhist logic: It is real. It is not real. It is both real and unreal. It is neither real nor unreal. Just like the smoker&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 214 ¬∑ Location 4479</p><p>Is it only a coincidence that with modern technology we find also that &ldquo;experimental reality&rdquo; on the sub-atomic (quantum) level‚Äîand the &ldquo;reality&rdquo; of specially-designed experience, sensory-sensual &ldquo;reality&rdquo; magnified by instruments‚Äîalso appears less Aristotelian and more Buddhistic?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 214 ¬∑ Location 4483</p><p>I have suggested in other books that Einstein&rsquo;s physical relativity is just a special case of a more general neurological relativity: the observer, with or without instruments, always remains co-creator of the observation. To quote Nietzsche again: &ldquo;We are all greater artists than we realize.&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 214 ¬∑ Location 4486</p><p>Each nervous system creates a great art-work which it usually considers &ldquo;the&rdquo; &ldquo;real&rdquo; &ldquo;reality&rdquo; in the philosophical sense and projects outward. These reality-tunnels, assumed to be &ldquo;realities&rdquo; and experienced as &ldquo;realities,&rdquo; are not only as varied and imaginative as the paintings of Rembrandt and Van Gogh and Picasso, etc.; they are as marvelously creative as the musics of Vivaldi and Beethoven and Wagner and Harry James and Rock and Indian raga and Polynesian chants; they are as miscellaneous as the novelistic styles or &ldquo;frames&rdquo; of Jane Austen and James Joyce and Raymond Chandler and Leo Tolstoy and Lewis Carroll and Samuel Beckett.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 214 ¬∑ Location 4492</p><p>And every social reality-tunnel perpetuates itself by basically the same techniques as advertising, of which the chief is repetition. This is maintained half-consciously, by group reinforcement.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 214 ¬∑ Location 4495</p><p>The signals (speech units) that maintain the group-reality are repeated endlessly and quite cheerfully, while others are edited out by selection of who gets in.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 215 ¬∑ Location 4497</p><p>As Dr. Timothy Leary once remarked, most domesticated primate conversation consists of variations on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here. Are you still there?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Business as usual. Nothing has changed.&rdquo;</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 215 ¬∑ Location 4499</p><p>For instance, most of us are annoyed frequently by the daily newspaper. &ldquo;News&rdquo; or alleged news that we don&rsquo;t want to read gets printed; heathenish and heretical opinions appear on the letters page, and sometimes in the columnists; politicians (of the opposite camp, of course) tell the most outrageous lies, which also get printed.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 215 ¬∑ Location 4501</p><p>With modern computer technology, all of this can soon be avoided. Just fill out a simple questionnaire and mail it in. The computer will print a slightly different version of that day&rsquo;s paper for each reader, and your Personalized copy will come to you in the morning containing absolutely nothing but what you want to know.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 215 ¬∑ Location 4503</p><p>After a year, or maybe five years, you will have forgotten entirely all the &ldquo;alien&rdquo; and uncomfortable signals that once got through to you and caused you distress.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 215 ¬∑ Location 4505</p><p>This great breakthrough in computer technology has not yet occurred, but, meanwhile, most people do the best they can, and manage fairly well to edit out what they don&rsquo;t want to know.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 215 ¬∑ Location 4507</p><p>When they get together in groups, this is aided by the aforementioned group reinforcement. Everybody tells everybody how reasonable the group-reality is, and how wicked and perverse are all the alien groups with alternative group-realities.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 215 ¬∑ Location 4511</p><p>Of course, we all hallucinate frequently‚Äîand not just in the sense revealed by the Ames&rsquo; cockeyed room or similar &ldquo;tricks&rdquo;‚Äîand not just in &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the moon as bigger than Venus because of the illusions of distance‚ÄîThis happens to everybody occasionally: You are walking down the street. Half a block ahead of you, in the crowd, you &ldquo;see&rdquo; a friend. Maybe it&rsquo;s a small surprise (you thought he or she was in another city, or another country) or maybe it&rsquo;s no great surprise at all (he or she lives near this part of town), but in either case you feel happy because it is always good to see a familiar face in a crowd of strangers. You walk closer and the features of the person you &ldquo;recognized&rdquo; become clearer. It is not a friend at all. It is a complete stranger. In &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the friend who wasn&rsquo;t there, you selected‚Äîat a guess‚Äî30% to 50% of the gross features of the figure approaching, and then out of a blur, superimposed or added the remaining 50% or more of the features necessary to create a face you could recognize.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 216 ¬∑ Location 4522</p><p>Of course, we do not like to think of ourselves as hallucinators. We prefer the more soothing term, &ldquo;misperception,&rdquo; for cases like this. Only the mentally &ldquo;ill&rdquo; are hallucinating, we think. Still‚Äîthe difference is only a matter of degree . . .</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 216 ¬∑ Location 4536</p><p>And I think: Part of what we see seems more-or-less &ldquo;accurate&rdquo; perception (Ôøº) and part is projection or misperception or &ldquo;hallucination&rdquo; (Ôøº) and part is some mixture of the two (Ôøº)‚ÄîBut only those who are extremely unbalanced mentally see &ldquo;pure&rdquo; hallucinations with no source in the sensory-sensual world. So, in considering cases like these, I do not easily believe that the towns of Sunderland and Charleston and Memphis were totally mad and seeing things with no counterpart in actuality.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 217 ¬∑ Location 4542</p><p>And I wonder, if we did not, all of us, have strict imprinted and conditioned programs about what is &ldquo;real&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;unreal,&rdquo; would those folks have tuned in something less remarkable than reported, or something even more remarkable?</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 219 ¬∑ Location 4586</p><p>Colin Wilson, Criminal History of Mankind, op. cit.: Wilson presents a theory of the Violent Male, backed up by criminological and historical data from the past 3000 years, and some current anthropological data on our earlier ancestors. He claims the Violent Male basically acts like Van Vogt&rsquo;s Right Man: he can never admit he might be wrong about anything. His ego definition, as it were, demands that he is always Right, nearly everybody else is always Wrong, and he must &ldquo;punish&rdquo; them for their Wrongness. He despises the &ldquo;softness&rdquo; of &ldquo;emotions&rdquo; and thinks most people are fools. As such, he sounds like the Authoritarian Personality described by such psychologists as Fromm and Adorno; what makes him Violent is a particular savage intensity of what I have called modeltheism. The Right Man, in addition to the above traits, has a basically paranoid attitude toward people: he thinks they are all rotten; they have all cheated him; they are always cheating; they are sneaks; they are liars; they are, in fact, rotten bastards. He is going to be the rottenest bastard of all to get back at them.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 219 ¬∑ Location 4602</p><p>The Right Man stays in that Anger Model most of the time, virtually all the time‚Äîespecially if this becomes an intellectual fad. If he relaxes a bit, it doesn&rsquo;t last long: at the first inconvenience or disappointment, the Anger Model makes sense to him again: everybody is deliberately being nasty and cheating. He will have to punish them again.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 219 ¬∑ Location 4605</p><p>Wilson emphasizes that this model describes not only many, many infamous criminals, but quite a few of the more infamous statesmen and churchmen of history, who were not called criminals only because they were powerful enough to define what was &ldquo;crime&rdquo; in their society. Since these types have a strong power drive, most of history, as Wilson sees it, is Criminal History, the record of the crimes of one type of male.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 220 ¬∑ Location 4609</p><p>This analysis is in remarkable agreement with that of those Feminists who are not Fundamentalists and do not project this model onto all males. Wilson seems to be describing the historical syndrome that they call Patriarchy.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - Page 220 ¬∑ Location 4615</p><p>Here we might think again about Dr. Bruner&rsquo;s cat who was able to &ldquo;edit out&rdquo; sound at the ear-drum. These processes must be considered, not vaguely &ldquo;psychological,&rdquo; but concretely neurological.
