In 2002, Arthur Westover and Lauren Marangell found a profound correlation between people who ate sugar and those with depression.7 Statistically speaking, a perfect correlation is 1. Researchers almost never hit this mark, because there are always exceptions. But in their study, these researchers reported the correlation between eating sugar and having depression at 0.95—that’s pretty close to 1. And this was true across six countries!</p><p>400</p><ol start=7><li>Westover AN, Marangell LB. A cross-national relationship between sugar consumption and major depression? Depression and Anxiety. 2002;16:118–20. doi:10.1002/da.10054.</li></ol><p>42</p><p>In 2019, a meta-analysis of ten previously published observational studies including 37,131 people with depression concluded that consuming sugar-sweetened beverages put people at a higher risk for depression. If they drank just over a 12-ounce can of soda a day (about 45 grams of sugar) they increased their risk by 5 percent. But if they drank two and a half cans of soda a day (about 98 grams of sugar), their risk jumped to 25 percent.8 In other words, more sugar consumed also meant a greater risk of depression. Pay attention to the sugar content of what you drink.</p><p>400</p><ol start=8><li>Hu D, Cheng L, Jiang W.

Over a twenty-four-hour period, the brain needs only 62 grams of glucose to do its job, an incredible display of energy efficiency considering the brain has at least 100 billion cells. You can easily meet this need through healthy, whole foods. Consuming unhealthy processed foods like baked goods and soda, which are loaded with refined and added sugars, often in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, floods the brain with too much glucose. This “sugar flood” can lead to inflammation in the brain and may ultimately result in depression.</p><p>43</p><p>Research also shows that higher blood-glucose levels are linked to lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rats. BDNF is a protein found in the brain, gut, and other tissues that is critical to helping the brain grow and develop, as well as helping the brain adapt to stress.9 So you won’t be surprised to hear that studies have found low levels of BDNF in women with depression.10 BDNF may also improve the effect of antidepressant drugs, another indicator that it plays an important role in preventing depression.11</p><p>400</p><ol start=9><li>Marosi K, Mattson MP.

That means they can also raise your risk for depression. Don’t panic, I’m not going to suggest eliminating carbs from your diet completely! But the quality of the carbs you eat matters.</p><p>44</p><p>In 2018, researchers sought to evaluate which particular carbohydrates, if any, had an association with depression.12 They administered a questionnaire called the carbohydrate-quality index to 15,546 participants. “Better-quality” carbohydrates were defined as whole grains, foods high in fiber, and those ranked low on the glycemic index (GI). The GI is a measure of how quickly foods convert to glucose when broken down during digestion; the faster a food turns into glucose in the body, the higher its GI ranking.</p><p>44</p><p>Of the participants in this study, 769 people were found to be depressed. The researchers discovered that people who had the highest score on the carbohydrate-quality index, meaning they were eating better-quality carbs, were also 30 percent less likely to develop depression than those who were eating high-GI carbs. In other words, a high-GI diet appears to be a risk factor for depression.13 High-GI carbs include potatoes, white bread, and white rice. Honey, orange juice, and whole-meal breads are medium-GI foods. Low-GI foods include green vegetables, most fruits, raw carrots, kidney beans, chickpeas, and lentils.</p><p>401</p><ol start=12><li>Sánchez-Villegas A, Zazpe I, Santiago S, Perez-Cornago A, Martinez-Gonzalez MA, Lahortiga-Ramos F.

However, a word of caution: you don’t want to overindulge in medium- or low-GI foods either. A large quantity of any carbs, no matter what their GI, places what is called a high glycemic load on your body. Very simply, the glycemic load of a certain food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise your blood-glucose level after you eat it. Studies show that a high glycemic load can increase your chances of depression as well.</p><p>45</p><p>The take-home message? While you don’t need to cut out carbs completely to improve or avoid depression symptoms, it’s essential to make sure you’re choosing the right carbs and eating them in reasonable quantities. To help out, I’ve included a chart in Appendix A of common foods with low-, medium-, and high-glycemic loads.</p><p>46</p><p>Artificial Sweeteners, Especially Aspartame</p><p>46</p><p>Saccharin (Sweet’N Low), aspartame (NutraSweet), sucralose (Splenda), and stevia (Truvia) are just a few of the most popular artificial sweeteners in use by food manufacturers today. Other lesser-known compounds are erythritol, lactitol, maltitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. These sugar replacements are increasingly common in foods that purport to be “healthy” by helping you cut down on calories.</p><p>That’s alarming, because science implicates many artificial sweeteners in depression: one study showed that people who consume artificial sweeteners, mostly via diet drinks, are more depressed than those who don’t consume such beverages.14 Even worse, several studies have demonstrated that artificial sweeteners can be toxic to the brain, altering brain concentrations of mood-regulating neurotransmitters.15</p><p>401</p><ol start=14><li>Guo X, Park Y, Freedman ND, et al.

In 2017, a review of the studies on aspartame found that it increases substances in the brain that inhibit the synthesis and release of the “happy” neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin.16</p><p>In addition, aspartame causes oxidation, which increases harmful free radicals in the brain. We’ll talk about the damaging effects of oxidation many times throughout the book. Oxidation is a chemical process that releases certain particles known as reactive oxygen species, including free radicals, which are unstable molecules prone to causing havoc in cells.17 At low to moderate concentrations, reactive oxygen species are important to your brain cells because they help to maintain internal chemical balance. However, at higher concentrations, an imbalance between antioxidants (which fight free radicals) and the free radicals themselves triggers a condition called oxidative stress, which can cause cell loss or even brain damage and can render the brain more prone to depression.</p><p>401</p><ol start=17><li>Lobo V, Patil A, Phatak A, Chandra N.

However, there is mounting evidence that other sweeteners beyond aspartame, such as sucralose, could also be causing or worsening depression. A 2018 study showed that sucralose significantly alters gut bacteria in mice, increasing a type of bacteria that other studies show is increased in people who are depressed.18 Sucralose also increases myeloperoxidase activity. Myeloperoxidase is a marker of inflammation, and one study found that twins with a history of depression had levels of myeloperoxidase 32 percent higher than those without depression.19</p><p>402</p><ol start=18><li>Rodriguez-Palacios A, Harding A, Menghini P, et al.

In recent years, the conversation around fat in the diet has changed from all fats being unhealthy to a clearer distinction between “bad fats” (for instance, margarine, shortening, and hydrogenated oils) known to cause cardiovascular disease and other woes, and “good fats” (for instance, avocados, almonds, and olive oil) that can help prevent disease and benefit well-being.</p><p>49</p><p>In 2011, Almudena Sánchez-Villegas and her colleagues reported on earlier research in which they had set out to determine if there was an association between fats and depression.21 They enrolled 12,059 Spanish university graduates who were free of depression at the start of the study and had each answer a 136-item food-frequency questionnaire to estimate their consumption of specific culinary fats (olive oil, seed oils, butter, and margarine) in order to determine their intake of different categories of fats—saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), trans-unsaturated fatty acids (trans fats), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). During follow-up visits, participants were asked to note any new onset of depression.</p><p>After about six years, 657 new cases of depression were identified. The researchers found that the more trans fats in a participant’s diet, the more likely they were to become depressed. On the other hand, the more MUFAs and PUFAs a participant consumed, the less depressed they were. In terms of individual culinary fats, the researchers concluded that olive oil—which consists largely of MUFA—significantly lowered depression risk.</p><p>To prevent or lower your chances of depression, shun all trans fats. Although the Food and Drug Administration banned trans fats in 2018, food manufacturers are permitted a transition period to comply with this regulation, so trans fats can still be found in certain foods including microwave popcorn, frozen pizza, refrigerated biscuit dough, fast food, vegetable shortening, and some margarines.</p><p>402</p><ol start=21><li>Sánchez-Villegas A, Verberne L, De Irala J, et al.

For example, corn, sunflower, and safflower oil in moderation in your diet may be okay, but in excess they can cause an imbalance in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which may impact emotional regulation and lead to depression (more on this shortly).22</p><p>402</p><ol start=22><li>Ford PA, Jaceldo-Siegl K, Lee JW, Tonstad S.

Omega-3s are crucial to mental health, and we will discuss their benefits over the course of the book.</p><p>53</p><p>Omega-3s are important for normal body metabolism—they are a vital part of cell membranes and provide the starting point for making the hormones that regulate blood clotting, contraction and relaxation of artery walls, and inflammation. But since we cannot produce them on our own, we must get our omega-3s from our diet. This is why we call them essential fats.</p><p>53</p><p>The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). All three are important to the body, performing a number of tasks, especially in cell membranes. EPA and DHA are the two omega-3s that play the most critical role in mood disorders, so it’s particularly important to ensure that you get enough of them.</p><p>53</p><p>While there is some argument about the importance of omega-3s in the fight against depression, most studies suggest they are instrumental, including a 2016 meta-analysis of thirteen randomized controlled trials of 1,233 patients with major depressive disorder. It found a beneficial overall effect of omega-3s in patients with major depressive disorder, especially in participants taking higher amounts of EPA and in those taking antidepressants.26</p><p>403</p><ol start=26><li>Mocking RJT, Harmsen I, Assies J, Koeter MWJ, Ruhé HG, Schene AH.

The key is to maintain a healthy balance between omega-3s and omega-6s, which are found in different foods. In a typical Western diet, omega-6s are quite common, while omega-3s are much rarer, leading to an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of somewhere around 15 to 1. The ideal ratio is more like 4 to 1.27 That means most Americans need to cut down on omega-6s while eating more omega-3s.</p><p>403</p><ol start=27><li>Simopoulos A. The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids. Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy. 2002;56(8):365–79. doi:10.1016/s0753-3322(02)00253–6.</li></ol><p>54</p><p>Indeed, studies have shown that people who consume foods high in omega-6 fatty acids have more than four times the risk of depression compared to those who consume foods high in omega-3s. This means that eating foods high in omega-6s like full-fat cheese, high-fat cuts of red meat, corn oil, and palm oil may increase your chances of depression. On the contrary, eating foods high in omega-3s like fatty fish, walnuts, vegetable oils, and dark, leafy vegetables may protect you against depression.</p><p>54</p><p>The very best source of omega-3s, especially EPA and DHA, is fish. In particular, cold-water fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines, contain high amounts of omega-3s. Fish with a lower fat content, such as bass, tilapia, cod, and shellfish, aren’t quite as rich in omega-3s but still have significant amounts. Farmed fish usually have higher levels of EPA and DHA than wild-caught fish, but it depends on the food they are fed. That’s because fish themselves do not actually make the omega-3s. Instead, they are found in microalgae. When the fish consume phytoplankton, which consumes microalgae, they accumulate omega-3s in their tissues.</p><p>54</p><p>Omega-3s can also be found in other foods, though nothing is as good a source as fatty fish. Grass-fed beef contains more omega-3s than commercial beef. Alpha-linolenic acid is available from plant sources like edamame, walnuts, and chia seeds, and there are an increasing number of omega-3-fortified foods on the market, especially eggs, milk, and yogurt.</p><p>54</p><p>While canola oil is far from a perfect source of omega-3s, its ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is roughly 2 to 1, making it a natural choice for a healthier alternative to similar oils.</p><p>55</p><p>Foods Rich in Helpful Vitamins</p><p>55</p><p>Many vitamins play key roles in preventing and easing depression. The most important are folate (B9) and B12. Their functions in the body are inextricably linked: a deficiency in vitamin B12 results in a folate deficiency, which can ultimately contribute to a loss of brain cells, chiefly those located in the hippocampus. Termed “hippocampal atrophy,” this loss of brain cells is associated with depression. The hippocampus is a critical brain structure that plays an important role in learning and memory, so depressed patients may lose their ability to learn new ways to cope with their stress.</p><p>55</p><p>In patients with folate deficiency, depression is the most common symptom.28 In fact, studies have demonstrated that the higher one’s folate level, the lower one’s level of depression.29 In addition to its role in the hippocampus, folate may also affect serotonin synthesis, and in depression, serotonin is often low.30</p><p>Hence, both vitamin B12 and folate should be optimized to prevent or treat depression. Enjoy ample amounts of legumes, citrus fruits, bananas, avocados, leafy green and cruciferous vegetables, asparagus, nuts and seeds, and fish and shellfish.</p><p>Vitamins B1 (thiamine) and B6 (pyridoxine) are also key for preventing and easing depression, as they help the brain produce and synthesize the neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation. These vitamins are abundant in the foods mentioned in the previous paragraph, as well as in soybeans and whole grains.</p><p>403</p><ol start=28><li>Alpert JE, Fava M.

Diet is associated with restriction, while, truly, this dietary approach is all about the delicious foods you can add to your life to enhance your meals and feel better in the process. Plus, when you don’t feel you’re giving up food, you can avoid what inevitably occurs on restrictive diets: the pendulum swinging back, where you end up overeating the shunned foods anyway. The MEP is a plant-based diet that’s abundant in locally grown seasonal fruits and vegetables and other foods that are minimally processed (e.g., beans, nuts, whole grains). Sweets are limited, and only high-quality fats are acceptable, with olive oil being the primary source of fat. The MEP includes low to moderate dairy intake, and protein is mainly seafood, with red meat and eggs consumed in smaller quantities and with low frequency. Wine is consumed in low to moderate amounts with meals, and herbs and spices are used instead of salt to add flavor to foods. In fact, there is plenty of flexibility with flavors. I always try to adapt the Mediterranean lifestyle to a patient’s culture and tastes, so, for example, I might suggest South Asian recipes for chickpeas or adding Mexican oregano and fajita spices to hummus, depending on what the patient loves to eat.</p><p>406</p><ol start=54><li>Boucher JL.

After all, the antidepressant mechanism of the Mediterranean diet is in large part due to its emphasis on consumption of fruits and vegetables—produce contains high levels of antioxidants that reduce oxidative stress and may, in turn, reduce neuron damage—and olive oil, which is rich in antioxidants and other brain-healthy compounds.56 Nutrient-dense fruits and veggies and high-quality olive oils are now more readily available in supermarkets and online. And of course, fish, nuts, and whole grains can be found at many grocery stores or farmers’ markets as well.</p><p>406</p><ol start=55><li>Hoffman R, Gerber M.

In the gut, specialized cells called enteroendocrine cells produce more than twenty signaling molecules, including peptides.3 The specific types of signaling molecules that are created are determined by your gut bacteria. By manipulating the gut bacteria of mice, and then monitoring the corresponding change in various kinds of peptides present in the guts and brains of the mice, Lach and his team were able to track how changes in the gut microbiome influenced symptoms of anxiety, proving that there is a profound connection between the two. Though the researchers weren’t able to make any conclusions about how this knowledge could be applied to microbiome-based therapeutic strategies to combat anxiety in humans, that’s certainly a possibility down the road.</p><p>407</p><ol start=2><li>Lach G, Schellekens H, Dinan TG, Cryan JF.

In 2018, a study compared the microbiota in people with generalized anxiety disorder to those of healthy controls.9 They found that the patients with generalized anxiety disorder had very different bacteria, which were both sparser and less diverse than those in their healthy counterparts. Specifically, bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids—like the peptides we just discussed, which are a sign of a healthy gut—were scarce, and there was an overgrowth of “bad” bacteria. That’s another clear example of how gut health affects brain health.</p><p>407</p><ol start=9><li>Jiang H, Zhang X, Yu Z, et al.

In other words, while the gut has immense influence on the brain’s behavior, the opposite may not be true—treating mental symptoms with antianxiety medication or psychotherapy doesn’t mean that the imbalances in your gut will automatically fall in line. In order to address the root of the problem, you have to target the actual bacteria too.</p><p>78</p><p>Finally, irregularities in your microbiome can weaken your gut wall, which usually serves as a barrier preventing bacterial metabolites and molecules from entering the bloodstream.10 Since a weakened gut wall allows bacteria to leak through the gut lining and into the blood circulation (and even into the brain), this is called leaky gut syndrome. While there are certainly compounds that need to travel into and out of our gut, in general we want to keep the bacteria of our microbiome confined there. When bacteria are allowed to escape, they can cause damage all over the body, including in the brain. For instance, we have evidence that a component of the bacterial cell wall called lipopolysaccharide causes anxiety-like behaviors in mice.11</p><p>407</p><ol start=10><li>Clapp M, Aurora N, Herrera L, Bhatia M, Wilen E, Wakefield S.

Up to 60 percent of patients with anxiety have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).12 IBS is a chronic disorder that causes abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, without any obvious physical cause. Marisol’s constipation, for example, was a sign of IBS, but the condition can also manifest as gas, bloating, diarrhea, or all of the above. To make matters worse, the more severe the anxiety, the more severe the IBS.13 That means when you have a stressor like hosting Thanksgiving dinner, your symptoms are likely to flare up.</p><p>408</p><ol start=12><li>Liu L, Zhu G.

While there’s no question that this diet is bad for your physical health, we’ll see its negative influence on mental health throughout this book. Anxiety is no exception.</p><p>81</p><p>Many animal studies indicate that high-fat and high-carbohydrate diets promote anxiety. For instance, in 2016, neuroscientist Sophie Dutheil and her colleagues demonstrated that rats on a high-fat diet were more prone to diabetes and anxiety.15 In 2017, a research group confirmed that diets rich in saturated fats and fructose increase anxiety-like behaviors in rats.16 And in mice, a lower-calorie diet has been shown to decrease anxiety while improving brain blood</p><p>408</p><ol start=15><li>Dutheil S, Ota KT, Wohleb ES, Rasmussen K, Duman RS.

In animal studies, obesity itself is not necessarily linked to anxiety—for example, obese mice were not found to be particularly anxious. However, when you give normal-weight mice microbiota from people on a high-fat diet, they become anxious even though they are not obese.23 That’s a strong indicator that the bacterial changes in your gut that come with obesity are responsible for the increased anxiety.

When I talk about high-fat and high-carb diets, I don’t mean that you have to cut out all fats or all carbs. As we’ve already covered, it’s important to make sure that you are getting plenty of high-quality monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially omega-3s, which we will examine again shortly); low-GI carbohydrates are fine too. Most important is to use portion control to keep your calorie intake reasonable, and to strictly limit the amount of bad fats (such as trans fats and saturated fats), and high-GI carbs (such as refined flour and sugar).</p><p>85</p><p>Caffeine</p><p>85</p><p>Caffeine can feel like a lifeline in a busy world, but it’s important to realize that excess caffeine in your diet can precipitate or worsen anxiety.

Since fiber-rich foods take longer to chew, you tend to eat them more slowly, which means your body has more time to recognize it’s full. Fiber can also fill up your stomach without contributing a lot of calories, which helps you feel more satiated with less food. It also takes a longer time to pass through the stomach and small intestine, which makes you feel full for longer.40</p><p>411</p><ol start=40><li>Howarth NC, Saltzman E, Roberts SB.

When the brain is inflamed, IL-1, an inflammatory marker, can increase dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, a collection of brain cells implicated in human anxiety. Studies have shown that omega-3s can suppress this effect in both animals and humans.47</p><p>412</p><ol start=46><li>Su K-P, Matsuoka Y, Pae C-U.

Hilimire’s study found that eating fermented food frequently correlated with having fewer symptoms of social anxiety in neurotic patients.

The first contained 5 mg/kg of tryptophan (the current US recommended daily allowance) for four days. The second diet contained double that dose for four days.

There is a body of evidence that suggests that eating carbohydrates along with protein can increase the tryptophan available to the brain.57 When you eat carbohydrates (like the mashed potatoes at Thanksgiving), the body produces insulin. This insulin diverts other amino acids to your muscles but leaves tryptophan untouched. As a result, tryptophan can cruise through into the brain.</p><p>413</p><ol start=57><li>Spring B.

The hippocampus plays a crucial role in providing feedback to the HPA-axis when there is stress, and it is also intricately connected to the amygdala.61 The cortex, too, is involved in how we respond to anxiety and stress.

In those early barbaric years, “madness” was considered a sinful state, and the mentally ill were housed in prisons. As civilization progressed, mentally ill patients were moved to hospitals.1 The problem is, as we became more and more focused on the troublesome thoughts and emotions of mental illnesses, we stopped noticing that the rest of the body was also involved.</p><p>This wasn’t always the case. In 2018, historian Ian Miller pointed out that eighteenth- and nineteenth-century doctors were clued in to the fact that the body’s systems are connected.2 That’s why they talked about the “nervous sympathy” among our different organs.</p><p>However, in the late nineteenth century, doctors changed this perspective. As medicine became more specialized, we lost track of the big picture, only looking at single organs to determine what was wrong and what needed fixing.</p><p>Of course, doctors did recognize that cancers might spread from one organ to the next, and that autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus could affect multiple organs in the body. But they neglected to see that organs that were seemingly quite separate in the body might still profoundly influence one another. Metaphorically speaking, illness could come from a mile away!</p><p>14</p><p>Compounding the problem was that, rather than working collaboratively, physicians, anatomists, physiologists, surgeons, and psychologists competed with one another. As one British doctor wrote in 1956, “There is such a clamour of contestants for cure that the patient who really wants to know is deafened rather than enlightened.”3</p><p>This attitude prevails in medicine even today. That’s why so many people are oblivious to the fact that when mental health is affected, the root of the problem is not solely in the brain. Instead, it’s a signal that one or more of the body’s connections with the brain has gone awry.</p><p>398</p><p>Miller I. The gut-brain axis: historical reflections. Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease. 2018;29(2):1542921. doi:10.1080/16512235.2018.1542921.</p><ol start=3><li>Ibid.</li></ol><p>15</p><p>We know that these connections are quite real. Depression can affect the heart. Pathologies of the adrenal gland can throw you into a panic. Infections darting through your bloodstream can make you seem like you have lost your mind. Maladies of the body frequently manifest as turbulence of the mind.</p><p>But while medical illness can cause psychiatric symptoms, we now know that the story goes even deeper. Subtle changes in distant parts of the body can change the brain too. The most profound of these distant relationships is between the brain and the gut. Centuries ago, Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, recognized this connection, warning us that “bad digestion is the root of all evil” and that “death sits in the bowels.” Now we are figuring out how right he was. Though we are still on the forefront of discovery, in recent years the gut-brain connection has provided one of the richest, most fertile research areas in medical science and the fascinating nexus of the field of nutritional psychiatry.</p><p>16</p><p>Once upon a time, a sperm made its way to an egg. They were not ships passing in the night. They connected. And when the union was successful, you were conceived. Warmly ensconced in your mother’s uterus, you, as this fertilized egg (called a zygote), started to change.</p><p>At first, the zygote’s smooth outer surface developed ripples like a mulberry. As time went on, the magical egg, under the spell of biological instructions, started to change its configuration until your baby body took shape. Eventually, after nine long months, you were armed with a heart, gut, lungs, brain, limbs, and other nifty things, ready to announce yourself to life.</p><p>But before all that, before you emerged ready to take on the world, before your gut and brain became distinct entities, they were one. They came from the same fertilized egg that gave rise to all the organs in your body.</p><p>In fact, the central nervous system, made up of the brain and spinal cord, is formed by special cells known as neural crest cells. These cells migrate extensively throughout the developing embryo, forming the enteric nervous system in the gut. The enteric nervous system contains between 100 million and 500 million neurons, the largest collection of nerve cells in the body. That’s why some people call the gut “the second brain.” And it’s why the gut and brain influence each other so profoundly. Separate though they may appear to be, their origins are the same.</p><p>17</p><p>While your gut and brain are housed in different parts of your body, they maintain more than just a historical connection. They remain physically connected too.</p><p>The vagus nerve, also known as the “wanderer nerve,” originates in the brain stem and travels all the way to the gut, connecting the gut to the central nervous system. When it reaches the gut, it untangles itself to form little threads that wrap the entire gut in an unruly covering that looks like an intricately knitted sweater. Because the vagus nerve penetrates the gut wall, it plays an essential role in the digestion of food, but its key function is to ensure that nerve signals can travel back and forth between the gut and the brain, carrying vital information between them. Signals between the gut and brain travel in both directions, making the brain and gut lifelong partners. That is the basis of the gut-brain romance.</p><p>18</p><p>The basis of all body communications is chemical. When you take a pill for a headache, you usually swallow it, right? It enters your mouth, then makes its way to your gut, where it is broken down. The chemicals from the pill travel from your gut to your brain through your bloodstream. And in your brain, they can decrease the inflammation and loosen your tense blood vessels too. When the chemicals you swallow successfully exert their effects on the brain, you feel relief from that pain.</p><p>In the same way as the chemicals in that pill, chemicals produced by the gut can also reach your brain. And chemicals produced by your brain can reach your gut. It’s a two-way street.</p><p>18</p><p>In the brain, these chemicals originate from the primary parts of your nervous system (with an assist from your endocrine system): the central nervous system, which comprises the brain and spinal cord; the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which comprises the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems; and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), which comprises the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal gland.</p><p>The central nervous system produces chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine that are critical for regulating mood and processing thought and emotion. Serotonin, a key chemical deficient in the brains of depressed and anxious people, plays a major role in regulating the gut-brain axis. Serotonin is one of the most buzzed-about brain chemicals because of its role in mood and emotion, but did you know that more than 90 percent of serotonin receptors are found in the gut? In fact, some researchers believe that the brain-serotonin deficit is heavily influenced by the gut,</p><p>19</p><p>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is in charge of a broad range of essential functions, most of which are involuntary: your heart keeps beating, and you keep breathing and digesting food because of your ANS. When your pupils dilate to take in more light in a dark room, that’s the ANS. Perhaps most crucially for our purposes, when your body is under duress, your ANS controls your fight-or-flight response, an instinctual reaction to threat that sends a cascade of hormonal and physiological responses through your body in dangerous or life-threatening situations. As we’ll see later on, the gut has a profound effect on fight or flight, particularly through the regulation of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline (also known as epinephrine and norepinephrine).</p><p>19</p><p>The HPA-axis is another crucial part of the body’s stress machine. It produces hormones that stimulate release of cortisol, the “stress hormone.” Cortisol amps the body up to handle stress, providing a flood of extra energy to deal with difficult situations. Once the threat passes, the cortisol level returns to normal. The gut also plays an important role in cortisol release and is instrumental in making sure the body responds to stress effectively.</p><p>20</p><p>In a healthy body, all these brain chemicals ensure that the gut and brain work smoothly together. Of course, as in all delicate systems, things can go wrong. When chemical over- or underproduction disrupts this connection, the gut-brain balance is thrown into disarray. Levels of important chemicals go out of whack. Moods are upset. Concentration is disrupted. Immunity drops. The gut’s protective barrier is compromised, and metabolites and chemicals that should be kept out of the brain reach the brain and wreak havoc.</p><p>20</p><p>sometimes gets lost in discussions about mental health is a simple truth: the food you eat can have just as profound an effect on your brain as the drugs you take. How can something as basic and natural as eating be as potent as a drug that cost millions of dollars to develop and test? The first part of the answer lies in bacteria.</p><p>21</p><p>Behind the scenes of the gut-brain romance is a huge collection of microorganisms that reside in the gut.4 We call this panoply of different bacterial species the microbiome. The gut microbiome—in both humans and other animals—is another type of romance, with both parties relying on each other for survival. Our guts provide the bacteria with a place to live and thrive, and in return they perform crucial tasks for us that our bodies can’t perform on their own.</p><p>398</p><ol start=4><li>Carabotti M, Scirocco A, Maselli MA, Severi C. The gut-brain axis: interactions between enteric microbiota, central and enteric nervous systems. Annals of Gastroenterology. 2015;28(2):203–9.</li></ol><p>21</p><p>The microbiome is made up of many different types of bacteria, with a much greater diversity of species in the gut than anywhere else in the body. Each individual gut can contain up to a thousand different species of bacteria, though most of them belong to two groups—Firmicutes and Bacteroides—which make up about 75 percent of the entire microbiome.</p><p>21</p><p>While we won’t spend too much time discussing individual species in this book, suffice it to say that when it comes to bacteria, there are good guys and bad guys. The microorganisms that inhabit the gut are normally good guys, but it’s inevitable that some bad ones get mixed in. This isn’t necessarily a concern, as your body generally makes sure that the good and bad bacteria stay at the right balance. But if diet, stress, or other mental or physical problems cause changes in gut bacteria, that can cause a ripple effect that leads to many negative health effects.</p><p>21</p><p>The idea that the microbiome plays such an essential role in bodily function is relatively new in medicine (think about how often you’ve heard of bacteria as “germs that will make you sick” rather than as a helpful team of microorganisms that performs a vital service), particularly when it comes to bacteria’s influence on the brain. But over the years, the science has been building that gut bacteria can affect mental function.</p><p>About thirty years ago, in one of the most compelling studies that first made us aware that changes in gut bacteria could influence mental function, researchers reported on a series of patients with a kind of delirium (called hepatic encephalopathy) due to liver failure. In hepatic encephalopathy, bacterial “bad guys” produce toxins, and the study showed that these patients stopped being delirious when antibiotics were administered by mouth. That was a clear sign that changing gut bacteria could also change mental function.</p><p>22</p><p>In the years since, we’ve accumulated a huge amount of knowledge about how the gut microbiome affects mental health, and we’ll unpack that knowledge throughout this book. For instance, did you know that functional bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease also come with mood changes due to bacterial populations being altered?5 Or that some clinicians feel that adding a probiotic as part of a psychiatric medication treatment plan can also help to lower anxiety and depression? Or that if you transfer the gut bacteria of schizophrenic humans into the guts of lab mice, those mice also start to show symptoms of schizophrenia?</p><p>23</p><p>The primary reason gut bacteria have such a profound effect on mental health is that they are responsible for making many of the brain chemicals we discussed in the last section. If normal gut bacteria are not present, production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)—all critically important for the regulation of mood, memory, and attention—is impacted. As we’ll see, many psychiatric disorders are rooted in deficits and imbalances of these chemicals, and many psychiatric drugs are tasked with manipulating their levels. Therefore, if your gut bacteria are intimately involved with producing these vital chemicals, it stands to reason that when your gut bacteria are altered, you risk doing damage to this complex web of body and brain function. That’s a lot of responsibility for a group of microscopic organisms!</p><p>23</p><p>Different collections of bacteria affect brain chemistry differently. For instance, changes in proportions and function of Escherichia, Bacillus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus can result in changes in dopamine levels and may predispose one to Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.6 Other combinations of abnormal gut bacteria may result in abnormally high concentrations of acetylcholine, histamine, endotoxin, and cytokines, which can damage brain tissue.</p><p>398</p><ol start=6><li>Giau V, Wu S, Jamerlan A, An S, Kim S, Hulme J.

Prikladnaia Biokhimiia i Mikrobiologiia. 2009;45(5):550–54.</li></ol><p>23</p><p>In addition to regulating neurotransmitter levels, there are various other ways in which microbiota influence the gut-brain connection. They are involved in the production of other important compounds like brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports the survival of existing neurons and promotes new neuron growth and connections. They influence the integrity of the gut wall and the gut’s barrier function, which protect the brain and the rest of the body from substances that need to be confined to the gut. Bacteria can also have an effect on inflammation in the brain and body, particularly influencing oxidation, a harmful process that results in cellular damage.</p><p>24</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the gut-brain connection works both ways. So if gut bacteria can influence the brain, it is also true that the brain can change gut bacteria.</p><p>All it takes is two hours’ worth of psychological stress to completely change the bacteria in your gut.7 In other words, a tense family Christmas dinner or unusually bad traffic can be enough to upset the balance of your microbiome. The theory is that the ANS and HPA-axis send signaling molecules to gut bacteria when you are stressed, changing bacterial behavior and composition. The results can be damaging. For example, one kind of bacterium changed by stress is Lactobacillus. Normally, it breaks down sugars into lactic acid, prevents harmful bacteria from lining the intestine, and protects your body against fungal infections. But when you are stressed, Lactobacillus fails on all these fronts due to how stress disrupts its functioning, leaving you exposed to harm.</p><p>24</p><p>The brain can also affect the physical movements of the gut (for example, how the gut contracts), and it controls the secretion of acid, bicarbonate, and mucus, all of which provide the gut’s protective lining. In some instances, the brain affects how the gut handles fluid. When your brain is not functioning well—for example, when you have depression or anxiety—all these normal and protective effects on the gut are compromised. As a result, food is not properly absorbed, which in turn has a negative effect on the rest of the body since it’s not getting the nutrients it needs.</p><p>25</p><p>So to recap, your brain needs the proper balance of gut bacteria to make the chemicals it needs to stay stable and healthy. The gut needs your brain to be stable and healthy so that it can maintain the proper balance of gut bacteria. If that cyclical relationship is disrupted, it means trouble for both the gut and the brain. An unhealthy gut microbiome leads to an unhealthy brain, and vice versa.</p><p>25</p><p>A quick illustration of these issues is provided by a survey Mireia Valles-Colomer and her colleagues conducted in April 2019 of more than a thousand people, in which they correlated microbiome features with well-being and depression.8 They found that butyrate-producing bacteria were consistently associated with higher quality-of-life indicators. Many bacteria were also depleted in people with depression, even after correcting for the confounding effects of antidepressants. They also found that when the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, which helps gut bacterial growth, is high, mental health is improved. GABA production is disturbed in people with depression too.</p><p>398</p><ol start=8><li>Valles-Colomer M, Falony G, Darzi Y, et al.

When food is broken down, its constituent parts can also pass through the gut wall into the bloodstream, and certain metabolites can act on the brain that way as well.</p><p>As we’ve already touched on, food’s most profound effect on the brain is through its impact on your gut bacteria. Some foods promote the growth of helpful bacteria, while others inhibit this growth. Because of that effect, food is some of the most potent mental health medicine available, with dietary interventions sometimes achieving similar results to specifically engineered pharmaceuticals, at a fraction of the price and with few if any side effects.</p><p>On the other hand, food can also made you sad—certain food groups and eating patterns can have a negative effect on your gut microbiome and your mental health.</p><p>28</p><p>My own view of where we went wrong is this: psychiatric diagnoses have no statistical validity, and the conditions have no biomarkers of specific diseases.12 “Diagnoses” are simply lists of symptoms. We assume that when a person presents with psychological symptoms, the problem rests solely in the brain. Given what we have reviewed so far, it is clear that other organs such as the gut play a role in how we think and feel. We need to examine the whole person and their lifestyle in order to better treat them.</p><p>399</p><ol start=12><li>Liang S, Wu X, Jin F.

Despite the huge number of health issues that relate to diet, it may sound far-fetched, but many patients don’t hear food advice from their doctors, let alone their psychiatrists. Medical schools and residency programs do not teach students how to talk to patients about dietary choices.
