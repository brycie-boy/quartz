        <p>Societies also have operating systems. The laws, social customs, and economic arrangements that we encounter each day sit atop a layer of instructions, protocols, and suppositions about how the world works. And much of our societal operating system consists of a set of assumptions about human behavior.</p>

      <div class="bm-text">
        <p>In our very early days I mean very early days, say, fifty thousand years ago the underlying assumption about human behavior was simple and true. We were trying to survive. From roaming the savannah to gather food to scrambling for the bushes when a saber-toothed tiger approached, that drive guided most of our behavior. Call this early operating system Motivation 1.0. It wasn&apos;t especially elegant, nor was it much different from those of rhesus monkeys, giant apes, or many other animals. But it served us nicely. It worked well. Until it didn&apos;t.</p><p>As humans formed more complex societies, bumping up against strangers and needing to cooperate in order to get things done, an operating system based purely on the biological drive was inadequate. In fact, sometimes we needed ways to restrain this drive to prevent me from swiping your dinner and you from stealing my spouse. And so in a feat of remarkable cultural engineering, we slowly replaced what we had with a version more compatible with how we&apos;d begun working and living.</p>

        <p>At the core of this new and improved operating system was a revised and more accurate assumption: Humans are more than the sum of our biological urges. That first drive still mattered no doubt about that but it didn&apos;t fully account for who we are. We also had a second drive to seek reward and avoid punishment more broadly. And it was from this insight that a new operating system call it Motivation 2.0 arose. (Of course, other animals also respond to rewards and punishments, but only humans have proved able to channel this drive to develop everything from contract law to convenience stores.)</p>

        <p>Harnessing this second drive has been essential to economic progress around the world, especially during the last two centuries. Consider the Industrial Revolution. Technological developments steam engines, railroads, widespread electricity played a crucial role in fostering the growth of industry. But so did less tangible innovations in particular, the work of an American engineer named Frederick Winslow Taylor. In the early 1900s, Taylor, who believed businesses were being run in an inefficient, haphazard way, invented what he called scientific management. His invention was a form of software expertly crafted to run atop the Motivation 2.0 platform. And it was widely and quickly adopted.</p><p>Workers, this approach held, were like parts in a complicated machine. If they did the right work in the right way at the right time, the machine would function smoothly. And to ensure that happened, you simply rewarded the behavior you sought and punished the behavior you discouraged. People would respond rationally to these external forces these extrinsic motivators and both they and the system itself would flourish. We tend to think that coal and oil have powered economic development. But in some sense, the engine of commerce has been fueled equally by carrots and sticks.</p>

        <p>The Motivation 2.0 operating system has endured for a very long time. Indeed, it is so deeply embedded in our lives that most of us scarcely recognize that it exists. For as long as any of us can remember, we&apos;ve configured our organizations and constructed our lives around its bedrock assumption: The way to improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence is to reward the good and punish the bad.</p>

When you visit the Web to check the weather forecast or order some sneakers, you might be using Firefox, a free open-source Web browser created almost exclusively by volunteers around the world.

        <p>But ultimately, open source depends on intrinsic motivation with the same ferocity that older business models rely on extrinsic motivation, as several scholars have shown. MIT management professor Karim Lakhani and Boston Consulting Group consultant Bob Wolf surveyed 684 open-source developers, mostly in North America and Europe, about why they participated in these projects. Lakhani and Wolf uncovered a range of motives, but they found that enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver. A large majority of programmers, the researchers discovered, reported that they frequently reached the state of optimal challenge called flow. Likewise, three German economists who studied open-source projects around the world found that what drives participants is a set of predominantly intrinsic motives in particular, the fun . . . of mastering the challenge of a given software problem and the desire to give a gift to the programmer community. Motivation 2.0 has little room for these sorts of impulses.</p>

      <div class="bm-text">
        <p>What&apos;s more, open source is only one way people are restructuring what they do along new organizational lines and atop different motivational ground. Let&apos;s move from software code to the legal code. The laws in most developed countries permit essentially two types of business organizations profit and nonprofit. One makes money, the other does good. And the most prominent member of that first category is the publicly held corporation owned by shareholders and run by managers who are overseen by a board of directors. The managers and directors bearone overriding responsibility: to maximize shareholder gain. Other types of business organizations steer by the same rules of the road. In the United States, for instance, partnerships, S corporations, C corporations, limited liability corporations, and other business configurations all aim toward a common end. The objective of those who run them practically, legally, in some ways morally is to maximize profit.</p>

        <p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus has begun creating what he calls social businesses. These are companies that raise capital, develop products, and sell them in an open market but do so in the service of a larger social mission or as he puts it, with the profit-maximization principle replaced by the social-benefit principle. The Fourth Sector Network in the United States and Denmark is promoting the for-benefit organization a hybrid that it says represents a new category of organization that is both economically self-sustaining and animated by a public purpose. One example: Mozilla, the entity that gave us Firefox, is organized as a for-benefit organization. And three U.S. entrepreneurs have invented the B Corporation, a designation that requires companies to amend their bylaws so that the incentives favor long-term value and social impact instead of short-term economic gain.</p>

        <p>Neither open-source production nor previously unimagined not only for profit businesses are yet the norm, of course. And they won&apos;t consign the public corporation to the trash heap. But their emergence tells us something important about where we&apos;re heading. There&apos;s a big movement out there that is not yet recognized as a movement, a lawyer who specializes in for-benefit organizations told The New York Times. One reason could be that traditional businesses are profit maximizers, which square perfectly with Motivation 2.0. These new entities are purpose maximizers which are unsuited to this older operating system because they flout its very principles.</p>

        <p>Play a game with me and I&apos;ll try to illustrate the point. Suppose somebody gives me ten dollars and tells me to share it some, all, or none with you. If you accept my offer, we both get to keep the money. If you reject it, neither of us gets anything. If I offered you six dollars (keeping four for myself ), would you take it? Almost certainly. If I offered you five, you&apos;d probably take that, too. But what if I offered you two dollars? Would you take it? In an experiment replicated around the world, most people rejected offers of two dollars and below. That makes no sense in terms of wealth maximization. If you take my offer of two dollars, you&apos;re two dollars richer. If you reject it, you get nothing. Your cognitive calculator knows two is greater than zero but because you&apos;re a human being, your notions of fair play or your desire for revenge or your simple irritation overrides it.</p>

        <p>The trouble for our purposes is that Motivation 2.0 assumes we&apos;re the same robotic wealth-maximizers I was taught we were a couple of decades ago. Indeed, the very premise of extrinsic incentives is that we&apos;ll always respond rationally to them. But even most economists don&apos;t believe that anymore. Sometimes these motivators work. Often they don&apos;t. And many times, they inflict collateral damage. In short, the new way economists think about what we do is hard to reconcile with Motivation 2.0.</p><p>What&apos;s more, if people do things for lunk-headed, backward-looking reasons, why wouldn&apos;t we also do things for significance-seeking, self-actualizing reasons? If we&apos;re predictably irrational and we clearly are why couldn&apos;t we also be predictably transcendent?</p><p>If that seems far-fetched, consider some of our other bizarre behaviors. We leave lucrative jobs to take low-paying ones that provide a clearer sense of purpose. We work to master the clarinet on weekends although we have little hope of making a dime (Motivation 2.0) or acquiring a mate (Motivation 1.0) from doing so.

        <p>Begin with complexity. Behavioral scientists often divide what we do on the job or learn in school into two categories: algorithmic and heuristic. An algorithmic task is one in which you follow a set of established instructions down a single pathway to one conclusion. That is, there&apos;s an algorithm for solving it. A heuristic task is the opposite. Precisely because no algorithm exists for it, you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution. Working as a grocery checkout clerk is mostly algorithmic. You do pretty much the same thing over and over in a certain way. Creating an ad campaign is mostly heuristic. You have to come up with something new.</p>

      <div class="bm-text">
        <p>During the twentieth century, most work was algorithmic and not just jobs where you turned the same screw the same way all day long. Even when we traded blue collars for white, the tasks we carried out were often routine. That is, we could reduce much of what we did in accounting, law, computer programming, and other fields to a script, a spec sheet, a formula, or a series of steps that produced a right answer. But today, in much of North America, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, routine white-collar work is disappearing. It&apos;s racing offshore to wherever it can be done the cheapest. In India, Bulgaria, the Philippines, and other countries, lower-paid workers essentially run the algorithm, figure out the correct answer, and deliver it instantaneously from their computer to someone six thousand miles away.</p>

        <p>But offshoring is just one pressure on rule-based, left-brain work. Just as oxen and then forklifts replaced simple physical labor, computers are replacing simple intellectual labor. So while outsourcing is just beginning to pick up speed, software can already perform many rule-based, professional functions better, more quickly, and more cheaply than we can. That means that your cousin the CPA, if he&apos;s doing mostly routine work, faces competition not just from five-hundred-dollar-a-month accountants in Manila, but from tax preparation programs anyone can download for thirty dollars. The consulting firm McKinsey &amp;Co. estimates that in the United States, only 30 percent of job growth now comes from algorithmic work, while 70 percent comes from heuristic work. A key reason: Routine work can be outsourced or automated; artistic, empathic, nonroutine work generally cannot.</p>

        <p>The implications for motivation are vast. Researchers such as Harvard Business School&apos;s Teresa Amabile have found that external rewards and punishments both carrots and sticks can work nicely for algorithmic tasks. But they can be devastating for heuristic ones. Those sorts of challenges solving novel problems or creating something the world didn&apos;t know it was missing depend heavily on Harlow&apos;s third drive. Amabile calls it the intrinsic motivation principle of creativity, which holds, in part: Intrinsic motivation is conducive to creativity; controlling extrinsic motivation is detrimental to creativity. In other words, the central tenets of Motivation 2.0 may actually impair performance of the heuristic, right-brain work on which modern economies depend.</p>

        <p>Partly because work has become more creative and less routine, it has also become more enjoyable. That, too, scrambles Motivation 2.0&apos;s assumptions. This operating system rests on the belief that work is not inherently enjoyable which is precisely why we must coax people with external rewards and threaten them with outside punishment. One unexpected finding of the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, whom we&apos;ll encounter in Chapter 5, is that people are much more likely to report having optimal experiences on the job than during leisure. But if work is inherently enjoyable for more and more people, then the external inducements at the heart of Motivation 2.0 become less necessary. Worse, as Deci began discovering forty years ago, adding certain kinds of extrinsic rewards on top of inherently interesting tasks can often dampen motivation and diminish performance.</p>

        <p>Once again, certain bedrock notions suddenly seem less sturdy. Take the curious example of Vocation Vacations. This is a business in which people pay their hard-earned money . . . to work at another job. They use their vacation time to test-drive being a chef, running a bike shop, or operating an animal shelter. The emergence of this and similar ventures suggests that work, which economists have always considered a disutility (something we&apos;d avoid unless we received a payment in return), is becoming a utility (something we&apos;d pursue even in the absence of a tangible return).</p>

        <p>Finally, because work is supposed to be dreary, Motivation 2.0 holds that people need to be carefully monitored so they don&apos;t shirk. This idea, too, is becoming less relevant and, in many ways, less possible. Consider, for instance, that America alone now has more than 18 million of what the U.S. Census Bureau calls non-employer businesses businesses without any paid employees. Since people in these businesses don&apos;t have any underlings, they don&apos;t have anybody to manage or motivate. But since they don&apos;t have bosses themselves, there&apos;s nobody to manage or motivate them. They have to be self-directed.</p>

        <p>So do people who aren&apos;t technically working for themselves. In the United States, 33.7 million people telecommute at least one day a month, and 14.7 million do so every day placing a substantial portion of the workforce beyond the gaze of a manager, forcing them to direct their own work. And even if many organizations haven&apos;t opted for measures like these, they&apos;re generally becoming leaner and less hierarchical. In an effort to reduce costs, they trim the fatty middle. That means managers oversee larger numbers of people and therefore scrutinize each one less closely.</p><p>As organizations flatten, companies need people who are self-motivated. That forces many organizations to become more like, er, Wikipedia. Nobody manages the Wikipedians. Nobody sits around trying to figure out how to motivate them. That&apos;s why Wikipedia works. Routine, not-so-interesting jobs require direction; nonroutine, more interesting work depends on self-direction. One business leader, who didn&apos;t want to be identified, said it plainly. When he conducts job interviews, he tells prospective employees: If you need me to motivate you, I probably don&apos;t want to hire you.</p>

        <p>Of course, the starting point for any discussion of motivation in the workplace is a simple fact of life: People have to earn a living. Salary, contract payments, some benefits, a few perks are what I call baseline rewards. If someone&apos;s baseline rewards aren&apos;t adequate or equitable, her focus will be on the unfairness of her situation and the anxiety of her circumstance. You&apos;ll get neither the predictability of extrinsic motivation nor the weirdness of intrinsic motivation. You&apos;ll get very little motivation at all.</p>

        <p>Behavioral scientists like Deci began discovering the Sawyer Effect nearly forty years ago, although they didn&apos;t use that term. Instead, they referred to the counterintuitive consequences of extrinsic incentives as the hidden costs of rewards. That, in fact, was the title of the first book on the subject a 1978 research volume that was edited by psychologists Mark Lepper and David Greene.</p><p>One of Lepper and Greene&apos;s early studies (which they carried out with a third colleague, Robert Nisbett) has become a classic in the field and among the most cited articles in the motivation literature. The three researchers watched a classroom of preschoolers for several days and identified the children who chose to spend their free play time drawing. Then they fashioned an experiment to test the effect of rewarding an activity these children clearly enjoyed.</p>

        <p>The researchers divided the children into three groups. The first was the expected-award group. They showed each of these children a Good Player certificate adorned with a blue ribbon and featuring the child&apos;s name and asked if the child wanted to draw in order to receive the award. The second group was the unexpected-award group. Researchers asked these children simply if they wanted to draw. If they decided to, when the session ended, the researchers handed each child one of the Good Player certificates. The third group was the no-award group. Researchers asked these children if they wanted to draw, but neither promised them a certificate at the beginning nor gave them one at the end.</p><p>Two weeks later, back in the classroom, teachers set out paper and markers during the preschool&apos;s free play period while the researchers secretly observed the students. Children previously in the unexpected-award and no-award groups drew just as much, and with the same relish, as they had before the experiment. But children in the first group the ones who&apos;d expected and then received an award showed much less interest and spent much less time drawing. The Sawyer Effect had taken hold. Even two weeks later, those alluring prizes so common in classrooms and cubicles had turned play into work.</p>

        <p>To be clear, it wasn&apos;t necessarily the rewards themselves that dampened the children&apos;s interest. Remember: When children didn&apos;t expect a reward, receiving one had little impact on their intrinsic motivation. Only contingent rewards if you do this, then you&apos;ll get that had the negative effect. Why? If-then rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy. Like the gentlemen driving carriages for money instead of fun, they&apos;re no longer fully controlling their lives. And that can spring a hole in the bottom of their motivational bucket, draining an activity of its enjoyment.</p>

        <p>Even if those controlling if-then rewards activate the Sawyer Effect and suffocate the third drive, maybe they actually get people to perform better.

        <p>One of the difficulties of laboratory experiments that test the impact of extrinsic motivators like cash is the cost. If you&apos;re going to pay people to perform, you have to pay them a meaningful amount. And in the United States or Europe, where standards of living are high, an individually meaningful amount multiplied by dozens of participants can rack up unsustainably large bills for behavioral scientists.</p><p>In part to circumvent this problem, a quartet of economists including Dan Ariely, whom I mentioned in the last chapter set up shop in Madurai, India, to gauge the effects of extrinsic incentives on performance. Because the cost of living in rural India is much lower than in North America, the researchers could offer large rewards without breaking their own banks.</p>

        <p>They recruited eighty-seven participants and asked them to play several games for example, tossing tennis balls at a target, unscrambling anagrams, recalling a string of digits that required motor skills, creativity, or concentration. To test the power of incentives, the experimenters offered three types of rewards for reaching certain performance levels.</p><p>One-third of the participants could earn a small reward 4 rupees (at the time worth around 50 U.S. cents and equal to about a day&apos;s pay in Madurai) for reaching their performance targets. One-third could earn a medium reward 40 rupees (about $5, or two weeks&apos; pay). And one-third could earn a very large reward 400 rupees (about $50, or nearly five months&apos; pay).</p>

        <p>For a quick test of problem-solving prowess, few exercises are more useful than the candle problem. Devised by psychologist Karl Duncker in the 1930s, the candle problem is used in a wide variety of experiments in behavioral science. Follow along and see how you do.</p><p>You sit at a table next to a wooden wall and the experimenter gives you the materials shown below: a candle, some tacks, and a book of matches.</p>

        <p>Your job is to attach the candle to the wall so that the wax doesn&apos;t drip on the table. Think for a moment about how you&apos;d solve the problem. Many people begin by trying to tack the candle to the wall. But that doesn&apos;t work. Some light a match, melt the side of the candle, and try to adhere it to the wall. That doesn&apos;t work either. But after five or ten minutes, most people stumble onto the solution, which you can see below.</p>

        <p>What happens when you give people a conceptual challenge like this and offer them rewards for speedy solutions? Sam Glucksberg, a psychologist now at Princeton University, tested this a few decades ago by timing how quickly two groups of participants solved the candle problem. He told the first group that he was timing their work merely to establish norms for how long it typically took someone to complete this sort of puzzle. To the second group he offered incentives. If a participant&apos;s time was among the fastest 25 percent of all the people being tested, that participant would receive $5. If the participant&apos;s time was the fastest of all, the reward would be $20. Adjusted for inflation, those are decent sums of money for a few minutes of effort a nice motivator.</p><p>How much faster did the incentivized group come up with a solution? On average, it took them nearly three and a half minutes longer . Yes, three and a half minutes longer. (Whenever I&apos;ve relayed these results to a group of businesspeople, the reaction is almost always a loud, pained, involuntary gasp.) In direct contravention to the core tenets of Motivation 2.0, an incentive designed to clarify thinking and sharpen creativity ended up clouding thinking and dulling creativity. Why? Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus. That&apos;s helpful when there&apos;s a clear path to a solution. They help us stare ahead and race faster. But if-then motivators are terrible for challenges like the candle problem. As this experiment shows, the rewards narrowed people&apos;s focus and blinkered the wide view that might have allowed them to see new uses for old objects.</p>

        <p>Something similar seems to occur for challenges that aren&apos;t so much about cracking an existing problem but about iterating something new. Teresa Amabile, the Harvard Business School professor and one of the world&apos;s leading researchers on creativity, has frequently tested the effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. In one study, she and two colleagues recruited twenty-three professional artists from the United States who had produced both commissioned and noncommissioned artwork. They asked the artists to randomly select ten commissioned works and ten noncommissioned works. Then Amabile and her team gave the works to a panel of accomplished artists and curators, who knew nothing about the study, and asked the experts to rate the pieces on creativity and technical skill.</p><p>Our results were quite startling, the researchers wrote. The commissioned works were rated as significantly less creative than the non-commissioned works, yet they were not rated as different in technical quality. Moreover, the artists reported feeling significantly more constrained when doing commissioned works than when doing non-commissioned works. One artist whom they interviewed describes the Sawyer Effect in action:</p><p>Not always, but a lot of the time, when you are doing a piece for someone else it becomes more work than joy. When I work for myself there is the pure joy of creating and I can work through the night and not even know it. On a commissioned piece you have to check yourself be careful to do what the client wants.</p>

      <div class="bm-text">
        <p>Another study of artists over a longer period shows that a concern for outside rewards might actually hinder eventual success. In the early 1960s, researchers surveyed sophomores and juniors at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago about their attitudes toward work and whether they were more intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. Using these data as a benchmark, another researcher followed up with these students in the early 1980s to see how their careers were progressing. Among the starkest findings, especially for men: The less evidence of extrinsic motivation during art school, the more success in professional art both several years after graduation and nearly twenty years later. Painters and sculptors who were intrinsically motivated, those for whom the joy of discovery and the challenge of creation were their own rewards, were able to weather the tough times and the lack of remuneration and recognition that inevitably accompany artistic careers.</p>

      <div class="bm-text">
        <p>And that led to yet another paradox in the Alice in Wonderland world of the third drive. Those artists who pursued their painting and sculpture more for the pleasure of the activity itself than for extrinsic rewards have produced art that has been socially recognized as superior, the study said. It is those who are least motivated to pursue extrinsic rewards who eventually receive them.</p><p>This result is not true across all tasks, of course. Amabile and others have found that extrinsic rewards can be effective for algorithmic tasks those that depend on following an existing formula to its logical conclusion. But for more right-brain undertakings those that demand flexible problem-solving, inventiveness, or conceptual understanding contingent rewards can be dangerous. Rewarded subjects often have a harder time seeing the periphery and crafting original solutions. This, too, is one of the sturdiest findings in social science especially as Amabile and others have refined it over the years. For artists, scientists, inventors, schoolchildren, and the rest of us, intrinsic motivation the drive do something because it is interesting, challenging, and absorbing is essential for high levels of creativity. But the if-then motivators that are the staple of most businesses often stifle, rather than stir, creative thinking. As the economy moves toward more right-brain, conceptual work as more of us deal with our own versions of the candle problem this might be the most alarming gap between what science knows and what business does.</p>

        <p>What could be more valuable than having a goal? From our earliest days, teachers, coaches, and parents advise us to set goals and to work mightily to achieve them and with good reason. Goals work. The academic literature shows that by helping us tune out distractions, goals can get us to try harder, work longer, and achieve more.</p><p>But recently a group of scholars from the Harvard Business School, Northwestern University&apos;s Kellogg School of Management, the University of Arizona&apos;s Eller College of Management, and the University of Pennsylvania&apos;s Wharton School questioned the efficacy of this broad prescription. Rather than being offered as an Ôover-the-counter&apos; salve for boosting performance, goal setting should be prescribed selectively, presented with a warning label, and closely monitored, they wrote. Goals that people set for themselves and that are devoted to attaining mastery are usually healthy. But goals imposed by others sales targets, quarterly returns, standardized test scores, and so on can sometimes have dangerous side effects.</p><p>Like all extrinsic motivators, goals narrow our focus. That&apos;s one reason they can be effective; they concentrate the mind. But as we&apos;ve seen, a narrowed focus exacts a cost. For complex or conceptual tasks, offering a reward can blinker the wide-ranging thinking necessary to come up with an innovative solution. Likewise, when an extrinsic goal is paramount particularly a short-term, measurable one whose achievement delivers a big payoff its presence can restrict our view of the broader dimensions of our behavior. As the cadre of business school professors write, Substantial evidence demonstrates that in addition to motivating constructive effort, goal setting can induce unethical behavior.</p>

The centers opened at 7:30 A.M. and closed at 4:00 P.M. Parents had to retrieve their children by the closing time or a teacher would have to stay late.</p><p>During the first four weeks of the experiment, the economists recorded how many parents arrived late each week. Then, before the fifth week, with the permission of the day care centers, they posted the following sign:</p><p>ANNOUNCEMENT: FINE FOR COMING LATE</p><p>As you all know, the official closing time of the day care center is 1600 every day. Since some parents have been coming late, we (with the approval of the Authority for Private Day-Care Centers in Israel) have decided to impose a fine on parents who come late to pick up their children.</p><p>As of next Sunday a fine of NS 10 will be charged every time a child is collected after 1610. This fine will be calculated monthly, it is to be paid together with the regular monthly payment.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>The manager of the day-care center</p><p>The theory underlying the fine, said Gneezy and Rustichini, was straightforward: When negative consequences are imposed on a behavior, they will produce a reduction of that particular response. In other words, thwack the parents with a fine, and they&apos;ll stop showing up late.</p><p>But that&apos;s not what happened. After the introduction of the fine we observed a steady increase in the number of parents coming late, the economists wrote. The rate finally settled, at a level that was higher, and almost twice as large as the initial one. And in language reminiscent of Harry Harlow&apos;s head scratching, they write that the existing literature didn&apos;t account for such a result. Indeed, the possibility of an increase in the behavior being punished was not even considered.</p>

        <p>Up pops another bug in Motivation 2.0. One reason most parents showed up on time is that they had a relationship with the teachers who, after all, were caring for their precious sons and daughters and wanted to treat them fairly. Parents had an intrinsic desire to be scrupulous about punctuality. But the threat of a fine like the promise of the kronor in the blood experiment edged aside that third drive. The fine shifted the parents&apos; decision from a partly moral obligation (be fair to my kids&apos; teachers) to a pure transaction (I can buy extra time). There wasn&apos;t room for both. The punishment didn&apos;t promote good behavior; it crowded it out.</p>

        <p>If some scientists believe that if-then motivators and other extrinsic rewards resemble prescription drugs that carry potentially dangerous side effects, others believe they&apos;re more like illegal drugs that foster a deeper and more pernicious dependency. According to these scholars, cash rewards and shiny trophies can provide a delicious jolt of pleasure at first, but the feeling soon dissipates and to keep it alive, the recipient requires ever larger and more frequent doses.</p>

        <p>The Russian economist Anton Suvorov has constructed an elaborate econometric model to demonstrate this effect, configured around what&apos;s called principal-agent theory. Think of the principal as the motivat or the employer, the teacher, the parent. Think of the agent as the motivat ee the employee, the student, the child. A principal essentially tries to get the agent to do what the principal wants, while the agent balances his own interests with whatever the principal is offering. Using a blizzard of complicated equations that test a variety of scenarios between principal and agent, Suvorov has reached conclusions that make intuitive sense to any parent who&apos;s tried to get her kids to empty the garbage.</p><p>By offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that the task is undesirable. (If the task were desirable, the agent wouldn&apos;t need a prod.) But that initial signal, and the reward that goes with it, forces the principal onto a path that&apos;s difficult to leave. Offer too small a reward and the agent won&apos;t comply. But offer a reward that&apos;s enticing enough to get the agent to act the first time, and the principal is doomed to give it again in the second. There&apos;s no going back. Pay your son to take out the trash and you&apos;ve pretty much guaranteed the kid will never do it again for free. What&apos;s more, once the initial money buzz tapers off, you&apos;ll likely have to increase the payment to continue compliance.</p>

        <p>As Suvorov explains, Rewards are addictive in that once offered, a contingent reward makes an agent expect it whenever a similar task is faced, which in turn compels the principal to use rewards over and over again. And before long, the existing reward may no longer suffice. It will quickly feel less like a bonus and more like the status quo which then forces the principal to offer larger rewards to achieve the same effect.</p>

        <p>This addictive pattern is not merely blackboard theory. Brian Knutson, then a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, demonstrated as much in an experiment using the brain scanning technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). He placed healthy volunteers into a giant scanner to watch how their brains responded during a game that involved the prospect of either winning or losing money. When participants knew they had a chance to win cash, activation occurred in the part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. That is, when the participants anticipated getting a reward (but not when they anticipated losing one), a burst of the brain chemical dopamine surged to this part of the brain. Knutson, who is now at Stanford University, has found similar results in subsequent studies where people anticipated rewards. What makes this response interesting for our purposes is that the same basic physiological process this particular brain chemical surging to this particular part of the brain is what happens in addiction. The mechanism of most addictive drugs is to send a fusillade of dopamine to the nucleus accumbens. The feeling delights, then dissipates, then demands another dose. In other words, if we watch how people&apos;s brains respond, promising them monetary rewards and giving them cocaine, nicotine, or amphetamines look disturbingly similar. This could be one reason that paying people to stop smoking often works in the short run. It replaces one (dangerous) addiction with another (more benign) one.</p>

      <div class="bm-text">
        <p>Rewards&apos; addictive qualities can also distort decision-making. Knutson has found that activation in the nucleus accumbens seems to predict both risky choices and risk-seeking mistakes. Get people fired up with the prospect of rewards, and instead of making better decisions, as Motivation 2.0 hopes, they can actually make worse ones. As Knutson writes, This may explain why casinos surround their guests with reward cues (e.g., inexpensive food, free liquor, surprise gifts, potential jackpot prizes) anticipation of rewards activates the [nucleus accumbens], which may lead to an increase in the likelihood of individuals switching from risk-averse to risk-seeking behavior.</p><p>In short, while that dangled carrot isn&apos;t all bad inall circumstances, in some instances it operates similar to a rock of crack cocaine and can induce behavior similar to that found around the craps table or roulette wheel not exactly what we hope to achieve when we motivate our teammates and coworkers.</p>

        <p>Short-Term Thinking</p><p>Think back to the candle problem again. The incentivized participants performed worse than their counterparts because they were so focused on the prize that they failed to glimpse a novel solution on the periphery. Rewards, we&apos;ve seen, can limit the breadth of our thinking. But extrinsic motivators especially tangible, if-then ones can also reduce the depth of our thinking. They can focus our sights on only what&apos;s immediately before us rather than what&apos;s off in the distance.</p>

        <p>Many times a concentrated focus makes sense. If your office building is on fire, you want to find an exit immediately rather than ponder how to rewrite the zoning regulations. But in less dramatic circumstances, fixating on an immediate reward can damage performance over time. Indeed, what our earlier examples unethical actions and addictive behavior have in common, perhaps more than anything else, is that they&apos;re entirely short-term. Addicts want the quick fix regardless of the eventual harm. Cheaters want the quick win regardless of the lasting consequences.</p><p>Yet even when the behavior doesn&apos;t devolve into shortcuts or addiction, the near-term allure of rewards can be harmful in the long run.</p>

        <p>Consider publicly held companies. Many such companies have existed for decades and hope to exist for decades more. But much of what their executives and middle managers do each day is aimed single-mindedly at the corporation&apos;s performance over the next three months. At these companies, quarterly earnings are an obsession. Executives devote substantial resources to making sure the earnings come out just right. And they spend considerable time and brain-power offering guidance to stock analysts so that the market knows what to expect and therefore responds favorably. This laser focus on a narrow, near-term slice of corporate performance is understandable. It&apos;s a rational response to stock markets that reward or punish tiny blips in those numbers, which, in turn, affect executives&apos; compensation.</p>

        <p>But companies pay a steep price for not extending their gaze beyond the next quarter. Several researchers have found that companies that spend the most time offering guidance on quarterly earnings deliver significantly lower long-term growth rates than companies that offer guidance less frequently. (One reason: The earnings-obsessed companies typically invest less in research and development.) They successfully achieve their short-term goals, but threaten the health of the company two or three years hence. As the scholars who warned about goals gone wild put it, The very presence of goals may lead employees to focus myopically on short-term gains and to lose sight of the potential devastating long-term effects on the organization.</p>

        <p>Perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in the economic calamity that gripped the world economy in 2008 and 2009. Each player in the system focused only on the short-term reward the buyer who wanted a house, the mortgage broker who wanted a commission, the Wall Street trader who wanted new securities to sell, the politician who wanted a buoyant economy during reelection and ignored the long-term effects of their actions on themselves or others. When the music stopped, the entire system nearly collapsed. This is the nature of economic bubbles: What seems to be irrational exuberance is ultimately a bad case of extrinsically motivated myopia.</p>

        <p>By contrast, the elements of genuine motivation that we&apos;ll explore later, by their very nature, defy a short-term view. Take mastery. The objective itself is inherently long-term because complete mastery, in a sense, is unattainable. Even Roger Federer, for instance, will never fully master the game of tennis. But introducing an if-then reward to help develop mastery usually backfires. That&apos;s why schoolchildren who are paid to solve problems typically choose easier problems and therefore learn less. The short-term prize crowds out the l ong-term learning.</p>

        <p>In environments where extrinsic rewards are most salient, many people work only to the point that triggers the reward and no further. So if students get a prize for reading three books, many won&apos;t pick up a fourth, let alone embark on a lifetime of reading just as executives who hit their quarterly numbers often won&apos;t boost earnings a penny more, let alone contemplate the long-term health of their company. Likewise, several studies show that paying people to exercise, stop smoking, or take their medicines produces terrific results at first but the healthy behavior disappears once the incentives are removed. However, when contingent rewards aren&apos;t involved, or when incentives are used with the proper deftness, performance improves and understanding deepens. Greatness and nearsightedness are incompatible. Meaningful achievement depends on lifting one&apos;s sights and pushing toward the horizon.</p>
