description: Greetings traveler!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bryce McAlister. You have happened to stumble across The Cosmos. The Cosmos is, in short, my thinking, learning and writing environment. It is primarily where I engage in Time-Binding Semantic Circuit exercises. Or in other words, It is here that I dive into the depths of the chaotic universe that is my mind and attempt to emerge with coherent insights to share with the world.
