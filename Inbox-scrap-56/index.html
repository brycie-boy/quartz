Larger molecules such as dopamine and noradrenaline cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, which means that they are confined solely to your brain. But they are made of precursor molecules‚Äîbuilding blocks‚Äîthat can. And where are these precursor molecules made? You guessed it: the gut.</p><p>136</p><p>Gut bacteria play an important role in ADHD, synthesizing many of these chemical precursors.7 Different bacterial species in the gut produce different chemicals, which means that if gut bacteria change, the brain‚Äôs chemical stability can be upset.8 And as we‚Äôve seen with other conditions, a reduction in the diversity of gut bacteria can be particularly problematic.9</p><p>423</p><ol start=7><li>Lyte M.

Decreased anticipation of brain reward is a hallmark of ADHD‚Äîin other words, studies show that people with ADHD aren‚Äôt motivated as strongly by incentives to behave in a certain way.11 Sure enough, the researchers found that the ADHD subjects showed less brain activation in response to being rewarded. Furthermore, the less their brains responded to the reward, the more phenylalanine-producing bacteria were present in their guts. The researchers concluded that ADHD subjects had to make more bacteria that produce phenylalanine to compensate for how their brains responded.</p><p>423</p><ol start=11><li>Volkow ND, Wang G-J, Newcorn JH, et al.

In 2006, Helmut Niederhofer and Klaus Pittschieler assessed a sample of people across a broad age range to test the association between ADHD and celiac disease.13 The participants‚Äô ADHD symptoms were measured before they started a gluten-free diet and six months after. The study found that people who had celiac disease were more likely to have ADHD, and a gluten-free diet improved their symptoms after the initial six-month period.</p><p>423</p><ol start=13><li>Niederhofer H, Pittschieler K.

This condition is called non-celiac gluten sensitivity.14 While the association between non-celiac gluten sensitivity and ADHD is by no means conclusive, various studies point to a connection between the two. In some instances, as we saw in chapter 3 with my ‚Äúsilent celiac‚Äù patient Rex, gluten sensitivity may cause neurologic and psychiatric symptoms without any corresponding digestive symptoms.15 People typically associate gluten sensitivity with digestive issues, so in the absence of upset stomach or bowel symptoms, gluten isn‚Äôt on the radar as a factor that can worsen ADHD.</p><p>424</p><ol start=14><li>Cruchet S, Lucero Y, Cornejo V.

In 2005, P√§ivi A. Pynn√∂nen and her colleagues assessed adolescents with celiac disease and behavioral problems.16 They found that adolescent celiac disease patients had significantly lower tryptophan concentrations in their blood.</p><p>424</p><ol start=16><li>Pynn√∂nen PA, Isomets√§ ET, Verkasalo MA, et al.

The authors concluded that it was possible that behavioral problems, such as those that occur with ADHD, may in part be due to certain important precursor amino acids not being available until people stopped eating gluten. In certain individuals, gluten-free diets can help the body increase levels of the precursors to make serotonin, which is one neurotransmitter involved in ADHD.</p><p>141</p><p>Dairy</p><p>141</p><p>Eating a lot of dairy means you eat a lot of casein, which may worsen ADHD.17 Casein is the main protein found in dairy products such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream, but it can be a factor even in foods that are thought of as dairy substitutes, like nondairy creamer and margarine.</p><p>Not all casein is the same. The main form is called beta-casein, of which there are two major types, A1 and A2. Most regular milk contains both types, but research suggests that A1 proteins may be harmful to the gut in ways that A2 proteins are not.</p><p>In 2016, a team led by Sun Jianqin studied forty-five participants who consumed milk containing both A1 and A2 milk proteins, and then milk containing only A2 protein.18 The researchers found that when subjects drank milk containing A1 protein, they had more gastrointestinal inflammation, their thinking was slower, and they made more errors on an information-processing test. It was as if the A1 protein muddied their thinking, something that ADHD patients can ill afford. The study even suggested that lactose intolerance may be caused by sensitivity to A1 caseins rather than lactose itself.</p><p>Although more research is under way about whether A1 milk causes any adverse effects except occasional digestive problems, it‚Äôs clear that sufferers of ADHD should be cautious about the kind of casein they consume.19</p><p>424</p><ol start=17><li>Ly V, Bottelier M, Hoekstra PJ, Arias Vasquez A, Buitelaar JK, Rommelse NN.

Milk from breeds of cows that originated in Northern Europe is generally high in A1 protein. These breeds include Holstein, Friesian, Ayrshire, and British shorthorn. Milk that is high in A2 protein is mainly found in breeds that originated in the Channel Islands and southern France. These include Guernsey, Jersey, Charolais, and Limousin cows.20 Of course, it‚Äôs not often practical to choose what kind of cows your milk comes from! However, there are now A2-only milks available in many grocery stores and online.</p><p>424</p><ol start=20><li>Truswell AS. The A2 milk case: a critical review.

They are synthesized for use in medications like aspirin, Pepto-Bismol, and other products.</p><p>In 1976 Feingold formulated a diet that eliminated food additives and salicylates, which would come to be known as the Feingold diet.25 Some people refer to it as the Kaiser Permanente diet. It was popular in its early days, though the effects were poorly understood. The studies by Dr. Feingold were followed by other studies investigating the effects of eliminating artificial food coloring and eventually led to a diet eliminating many foods and additives, called the few foods diet. This diet is essentially an elimination diet, a category of diets pioneered in 1926 by food allergy specialist Albert Rowe and still in use today.26 In this approach, you remove one potentially offending food at a time and carefully record any changes in symptoms, before adding foods back in one at a time.</p><p>In 1983, a meta-analysis found that the effect of the Feingold diet on ADHD was actually quite weak, casting doubt on the efficacy of elimination diets in improving ADHD in general.27 However, in 2004, another meta-analysis of only the higher-quality studies demonstrated that eliminating food colorings seemed to make a difference in parents‚Äô observations of children with ADHD, but not in teachers‚Äô or other caretakers‚Äô observations.28</p><p>425</p><ol start=24><li>Yu C-J, Du J-C, Chiou H-C, et al.

Your gut bacteria may become less diverse as a result of your diet, which may cause the bad bacteria to outgrow the good bacteria, triggering a cascade of negative health effects. Food can also influence the chemical messages these bacteria send from your gut up to your brain along the vagus nerve‚Äîsignals that can make you feel either depressed and drained or uplifted and energized.</p><p>Animal research first led scientists to theorize that people who are depressed have different populations of gut bacteria than those who are not depressed. For instance, in mice, when the brain‚Äôs main center for smell is surgically removed, the mice exhibit depression-like behavior. These changes were accompanied by alterations in gut bacteria. In other words, inducing depression in mice changes their gut activity and bacteria.</p><p>Studies in humans appear to confirm this hypothesis. In 2019, psychiatrist Stephanie Cheung and her colleagues summarized findings from six studies3 that looked at gut health in patients with depression. They reported that patients with major depressive disorder had at least fifty types of bacterial species in their gut microbiome that were different from those of control subjects without major depressive disorder. Recent research suggests that bacterial species associated with higher quality-of-life indicators are depleted in depressed subjects, while bacteria that cause inflammation are often found in higher numbers in people suffering from depression.

Probiotic-rich foods contain beneficial bacteria that help your body and brain. An animal study in 2017 from the University of Virginia School of Medicine indicated that Lactobacillus, a single gut bacterium commonly found in live cultures in yogurt, can reverse depression in rats. This bacterium is often an ingredient in human probiotic supplement formulations. More recently, similar findings have been established in humans as well.</p><p>38</p><p>Prebiotics are essentially food for helpful bacteria, certain types of fiber that we cannot digest but the good bacteria in our guts can. For probiotics to be effective, it is helpful for them to have prebiotic foods available in the gut to digest. Probiotics break down prebiotics to form short-chain fatty acids that help reduce gut inflammation, block the growth of cancerous cells, and help the growth of healthy cells.</p><p>In 2010, Michael Messaoudi and his colleagues studied fifty-five healthy men and women who were randomly assigned to receive either a daily probiotic formula or a placebo for thirty days.4 Before and after treatment, the research subjects filled out questionnaires about their mood. They also provided urine samples so that their levels of cortisol, the body‚Äôs main stress hormone, could be checked.</p><p>Compared to the placebo group, those in the probiotic group reported less depression, and urinary levels of cortisol were lower, indicating that their brains were less depressed and less stressed.</p><p>Why was this the case?

Over a twenty-four-hour period, the brain needs only 62 grams of glucose to do its job, an incredible display of energy efficiency considering the brain has at least 100 billion cells. You can easily meet this need through healthy, whole foods. Consuming unhealthy processed foods like baked goods and soda, which are loaded with refined and added sugars, often in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, floods the brain with too much glucose. This ‚Äúsugar flood‚Äù can lead to inflammation in the brain and may ultimately result in depression.</p><p>43</p><p>Research also shows that higher blood-glucose levels are linked to lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rats. BDNF is a protein found in the brain, gut, and other tissues that is critical to helping the brain grow and develop, as well as helping the brain adapt to stress.9 So you won‚Äôt be surprised to hear that studies have found low levels of BDNF in women with depression.10 BDNF may also improve the effect of antidepressant drugs, another indicator that it plays an important role in preventing depression.11</p><p>400</p><ol start=9><li>Marosi K, Mattson MP.

That means they can also raise your risk for depression. Don‚Äôt panic, I‚Äôm not going to suggest eliminating carbs from your diet completely! But the quality of the carbs you eat matters.</p><p>44</p><p>In 2018, researchers sought to evaluate which particular carbohydrates, if any, had an association with depression.12 They administered a questionnaire called the carbohydrate-quality index to 15,546 participants. ‚ÄúBetter-quality‚Äù carbohydrates were defined as whole grains, foods high in fiber, and those ranked low on the glycemic index (GI). The GI is a measure of how quickly foods convert to glucose when broken down during digestion; the faster a food turns into glucose in the body, the higher its GI ranking.</p><p>44</p><p>Of the participants in this study, 769 people were found to be depressed. The researchers discovered that people who had the highest score on the carbohydrate-quality index, meaning they were eating better-quality carbs, were also 30 percent less likely to develop depression than those who were eating high-GI carbs. In other words, a high-GI diet appears to be a risk factor for depression.13 High-GI carbs include potatoes, white bread, and white rice. Honey, orange juice, and whole-meal breads are medium-GI foods. Low-GI foods include green vegetables, most fruits, raw carrots, kidney beans, chickpeas, and lentils.</p><p>401</p><ol start=12><li>S√°nchez-Villegas A, Zazpe I, Santiago S, Perez-Cornago A, Martinez-Gonzalez MA, Lahortiga-Ramos F.

However, a word of caution: you don‚Äôt want to overindulge in medium- or low-GI foods either. A large quantity of any carbs, no matter what their GI, places what is called a high glycemic load on your body. Very simply, the glycemic load of a certain food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise your blood-glucose level after you eat it. Studies show that a high glycemic load can increase your chances of depression as well.</p><p>45</p><p>The take-home message?

Other lesser-known compounds are erythritol, lactitol, maltitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. These sugar replacements are increasingly common in foods that purport to be ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù by helping you cut down on calories.</p><p>That‚Äôs alarming, because science implicates many artificial sweeteners in depression: one study showed that people who consume artificial sweeteners, mostly via diet drinks, are more depressed than those who don‚Äôt consume such beverages.14 Even worse, several studies have demonstrated that artificial sweeteners can be toxic to the brain, altering brain concentrations of mood-regulating neurotransmitters.15</p><p>401</p><ol start=14><li>Guo X, Park Y, Freedman ND, et al.

In 2017, a review of the studies on aspartame found that it increases substances in the brain that inhibit the synthesis and release of the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin.16</p><p>In addition, aspartame causes oxidation, which increases harmful free radicals in the brain. We‚Äôll talk about the damaging effects of oxidation many times throughout the book. Oxidation is a chemical process that releases certain particles known as reactive oxygen species, including free radicals, which are unstable molecules prone to causing havoc in cells.17 At low to moderate concentrations, reactive oxygen species are important to your brain cells because they help to maintain internal chemical balance. However, at higher concentrations, an imbalance between antioxidants (which fight free radicals) and the free radicals themselves triggers a condition called oxidative stress, which can cause cell loss or even brain damage and can render the brain more prone to depression.</p><p>401</p><ol start=17><li>Lobo V, Patil A, Phatak A, Chandra N.

However, there is mounting evidence that other sweeteners beyond aspartame, such as sucralose, could also be causing or worsening depression. A 2018 study showed that sucralose significantly alters gut bacteria in mice, increasing a type of bacteria that other studies show is increased in people who are depressed.18 Sucralose also increases myeloperoxidase activity. Myeloperoxidase is a marker of inflammation, and one study found that twins with a history of depression had levels of myeloperoxidase 32 percent higher than those without depression.19</p><p>402</p><ol start=18><li>Rodriguez-Palacios A, Harding A, Menghini P, et al.

In recent years, the conversation around fat in the diet has changed from all fats being unhealthy to a clearer distinction between ‚Äúbad fats‚Äù (for instance, margarine, shortening, and hydrogenated oils) known to cause cardiovascular disease and other woes, and ‚Äúgood fats‚Äù (for instance, avocados, almonds, and olive oil) that can help prevent disease and benefit well-being.</p><p>49</p><p>In 2011, Almudena S√°nchez-Villegas and her colleagues reported on earlier research in which they had set out to determine if there was an association between fats and depression.21 They enrolled 12,059 Spanish university graduates who were free of depression at the start of the study and had each answer a 136-item food-frequency questionnaire to estimate their consumption of specific culinary fats (olive oil, seed oils, butter, and margarine) in order to determine their intake of different categories of fats‚Äîsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), trans-unsaturated fatty acids (trans fats), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). During follow-up visits, participants were asked to note any new onset of depression.</p><p>After about six years, 657 new cases of depression were identified. The researchers found that the more trans fats in a participant‚Äôs diet, the more likely they were to become depressed. On the other hand, the more MUFAs and PUFAs a participant consumed, the less depressed they were. In terms of individual culinary fats, the researchers concluded that olive oil‚Äîwhich consists largely of MUFA‚Äîsignificantly lowered depression risk.</p><p>To prevent or lower your chances of depression, shun all trans fats. Although the Food and Drug Administration banned trans fats in 2018, food manufacturers are permitted a transition period to comply with this regulation, so trans fats can still be found in certain foods including microwave popcorn, frozen pizza, refrigerated biscuit dough, fast food, vegetable shortening, and some margarines.</p><p>402</p><ol start=21><li>S√°nchez-Villegas A, Verberne L, De Irala J, et al.

In addition to olive oil, MUFAs are found in nuts (almonds, walnuts) and nut butters (almond and cashew butter) as well as avocados.</p><p>50</p><p>While PUFAs are better than trans fats, not all sources of PUFAs are the best choices for depression. For example, corn, sunflower, and safflower oil in moderation in your diet may be okay, but in excess they can cause an imbalance in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which may impact emotional regulation and lead to depression (more on this shortly).22</p><p>402</p><ol start=22><li>Ford PA, Jaceldo-Siegl K, Lee JW, Tonstad S.

Omega-3s are crucial to mental health, and we will discuss their benefits over the course of the book.</p><p>53</p><p>Omega-3s are important for normal body metabolism‚Äîthey are a vital part of cell membranes and provide the starting point for making the hormones that regulate blood clotting, contraction and relaxation of artery walls, and inflammation. But since we cannot produce them on our own, we must get our omega-3s from our diet. This is why we call them essential fats.</p><p>53</p><p>The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). All three are important to the body, performing a number of tasks, especially in cell membranes. EPA and DHA are the two omega-3s that play the most critical role in mood disorders, so it‚Äôs particularly important to ensure that you get enough of them.</p><p>53</p><p>While there is some argument about the importance of omega-3s in the fight against depression, most studies suggest they are instrumental, including a 2016 meta-analysis of thirteen randomized controlled trials of 1,233 patients with major depressive disorder. It found a beneficial overall effect of omega-3s in patients with major depressive disorder, especially in participants taking higher amounts of EPA and in those taking antidepressants.26</p><p>403</p><ol start=26><li>Mocking RJT, Harmsen I, Assies J, Koeter MWJ, Ruh√© HG, Schene AH.

The key is to maintain a healthy balance between omega-3s and omega-6s, which are found in different foods. In a typical Western diet, omega-6s are quite common, while omega-3s are much rarer, leading to an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of somewhere around 15 to 1. The ideal ratio is more like 4 to 1.27 That means most Americans need to cut down on omega-6s while eating more omega-3s.</p><p>403</p><ol start=27><li>Simopoulos A. The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids. Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy. 2002;56(8):365‚Äì79. doi:10.1016/s0753-3322(02)00253‚Äì6.</li></ol><p>54</p><p>Indeed, studies have shown that people who consume foods high in omega-6 fatty acids have more than four times the risk of depression compared to those who consume foods high in omega-3s. This means that eating foods high in omega-6s like full-fat cheese, high-fat cuts of red meat, corn oil, and palm oil may increase your chances of depression. On the contrary, eating foods high in omega-3s like fatty fish, walnuts, vegetable oils, and dark, leafy vegetables may protect you against depression.</p><p>54</p><p>The very best source of omega-3s, especially EPA and DHA, is fish. In particular, cold-water fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, tuna, herring, and sardines, contain high amounts of omega-3s. Fish with a lower fat content, such as bass, tilapia, cod, and shellfish, aren‚Äôt quite as rich in omega-3s but still have significant amounts. Farmed fish usually have higher levels of EPA and DHA than wild-caught fish, but it depends on the food they are fed. That‚Äôs because fish themselves do not actually make the omega-3s. Instead, they are found in microalgae. When the fish consume phytoplankton, which consumes microalgae, they accumulate omega-3s in their tissues.</p><p>54</p><p>Omega-3s can also be found in other foods, though nothing is as good a source as fatty fish. Grass-fed beef contains more omega-3s than commercial beef. Alpha-linolenic acid is available from plant sources like edamame, walnuts, and chia seeds, and there are an increasing number of omega-3-fortified foods on the market, especially eggs, milk, and yogurt.</p><p>54</p><p>While canola oil is far from a perfect source of omega-3s, its ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is roughly 2 to 1, making it a natural choice for a healthier alternative to similar oils.</p><p>55</p><p>Foods Rich in Helpful Vitamins</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/This-Is-Your-Brain-On-Food/ data-ctx="Inbox scrap 56" data-src=/This-Is-Your-Brain-On-Food class=internal-link>This Is Your Brain On Food</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#D0A4FF}</style><script src=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bryce Mcalister using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com>Home</a></li><li><a href></a></li><li><a href></a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
