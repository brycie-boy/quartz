I READ the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they instill is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,—that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,—and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment.</p></li><li><p>Emerson opens the essay by mentioning that he read a poem and found himself stirred by its unconventionality. He notes that truly original art frequently has that impact, and that the feelings such a work stirs are more important than the thoughts it contains.</p></li><li><p>Emerson’s first move in the essay is to convince the reader that respecting intuition as a source of knowledge can yield greater enlightenment than looking to other sources outside of the individual.</p></li><li><p>He does so by making several provocative claims: individual perceptions of art or literature are more important than the actual works that occasion them, and ordinary intuitions are more important than those of respected sources of knowledge</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 396
Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the luster of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.</p></li><li><p>To place one’s thoughts out in the world because one believes they reveal something universal is what makes an individual a genius, Emerson says, but he believes that most ordinary people never speak such thoughts out loud, which is a shame.</p></li><li><p>Emerson thinks people should learn to pay attention to intuitions when they arise, and should voice them, because they are worth even more than the pronouncements of a famous writer or philosopher. What a shame it is, he says, to have a moment of intuition without sharing it, only to hear the same thought expressed by another person.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 403
There is a time in every man’s education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 407
This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 408
It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.</p></li><li><p>Emerson believes that every individual has a moment in their life when they recognize that envy is poisonous, a lack of originality is destructive, and that it is important to accept oneself. He argues that each person has to do their own work to discover themselves and the goodness that is in the world. Every person is unique by the design of the universe, and God will never reward insight to the person who is not brave enough to embrace what makes him unique.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 411
Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.</p></li><li><p>“Trust thyself,” Emerson tells the reader. The most important realization any individual can have, in fact, is that they should trust themselves above all others. Every person, says Emerson has some role to play in the design of the universe, and it is important to understand that place as well as one’s place in the spirit of the age. The people we call great are the ones who have most effectively had that recognition, so people should not remain afraid to make whatever their individual contribution is if they are to participate in whatever great plan God has for the universe.</p></li><li><p>The simple aphorism “Trust thyself”  contrasts with the relatively complex sentences before and after it, emphasizing the importance of self-trust or self-reliance to authentic morality. Emerson then continues his practice of celebrating conventional examples of morality for unconventional reasons. He is also linking individual action to an underlying truth in the universe.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 416
What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text, in the face and behavior of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces, we are disconcerted.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 419
Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to you and me.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 423
The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlor what the pit is in the playhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their merits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never about consequences, about interests; he gives an independent, genuine verdict. You must court him: he does not court you.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 427
But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once acted or spoken with eclat, he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 429
There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass again into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges, and having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence, must always be formidable. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private, but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men, and put them in fear.</p></li><li><p>Emerson believes that the universe has placed before us perfect examples of the best way to approach the world and ourselves. Babies, children, and even animals are intuitively aware of their emotions, uninhibited by what someone else may think of them, and so they are the perfect example of what it means to be a self-reliant individual</p></li><li><p>One of Emerson’s goals in the essay is to help average people understand how to live out the transcendentalist ideal of confident individuality. The use of babies, children, and animals as examples is effective because it demonstrates to the reader that these traits are common and even ubiquitous, which means that self-reliance is within reach for most people.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 432
These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.</p></li><li><p>Emerson believes that when we are alone, we can be like the babies and the boys he just described and pay attention to our inner voices. Emerson states, “Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members.” When we get into society, however, society exerts its pressure on us, most specifically by asking us to be virtuous. Emerson compares society to a “joint-stock” company in which the price of investment is one’s manhood or independence. That price is usually what society sees as virtue, and what society most recognizes as virtue is conformity.</p></li><li><p>Emerson uses emotional appeals and an extended metaphor to support his argument for nonconformist morality. The sympathetic tone he takes underscores his admission that nonconformity is hard, while the comparison to the “joint-stock” company taps into trends in nineteenth-century American society that rejected sources of conventional morality like the church.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 435
Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.</p></li><li><p>Self-reliance, however, is the opposite of conformity, and Emerson sees most of society’s virtues as mere custom and deference to respected people.</p></li><li><p>According to Emerson “Whoso would be a man must be a conformist.” Any individual who wants to be truly themselves must therefore be a nonconformist and question for themselves whether what society calls goodness is good after all. The only thing that is truly good is the “integrity of your own mind,” says Emerson, and the sooner a person realizes that, the sooner they will be free.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 437
I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested,—“But these impulses may be from below, not from above.” I replied, “They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil’s child, I will live then from the Devil.”</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 440

Because of this tendency, people whose behavior should be questioned are not, as long as they espouse conventional morality.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 443
Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to him, “Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper: be good-natured and modest: have that grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite at home. ” Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to it,—else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached as the counteraction of the doctrine of love when that pules and whines.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 451
Then, again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison, if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots; and the thousandfold Relief Societies;—though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.</p></li><li><p>It would be better, Emerson believes, for people to take care of those for whom they genuinely care than to engage in charity because that is what conventional morality says we must do. Sometimes he himself conforms to societal expectations of goodness, he admits, but he knows that such conformity is evil because it does not arise from his own sense of right and wrong.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 456
Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There is the man and his virtues. Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,—as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.</p></li><li><p>Emerson observes that conventional morality is effectively a toll that an individual pays to belong to society. For his part, Emerson would much rather do right by his own conscience, even if doing so means he incurs the disapproval of society. Ultimately, he tries to live for what his mind tells him is right, not what looks pleasing to society at large</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 464
What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness.</p></li><li><p>Emerson states, “What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think,” meaning that he is not concerned with the appearance of goodness—he only cares about what he believes to be right.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 465
It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</p></li><li><p>Living by such a rule is difficult, however, because there will always be someone who thinks it’s their job to tell you right from wrong. Emerson observes that living according to conventional morality is easy when you live in the world, and living according to your own sense of morality is easy when you live in solitude, but it takes an independent spirit for a person to live by his own conscience within society. The struggle to do so, he believes, is worth the effort.</p></li><li><p>Emerson demonstrates his pragmatism by admitting that nonconformity is hard because almost the whole of society is built around conformity and certain concessions from the individual. That admission and the praise he heaps on the individual who refuses to conform while living in society serve as encouragement to the reader contemplating such a difficult path.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 468
The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is, that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers,—under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are. And, of course, so much force is withdrawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reënforce yourself.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 471
A man must consider what a blindman’s-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word? Do I not know that, with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution, he will do no such thing? Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side,—the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation.</p></li><li><p>Emerson’s primary objection to living one’s life on the basis of conventional morality is that it obscures who the individual really is as a person. Furthermore, a person who has embraced conventional morality is completely predictable and false to themselves in every way.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 476
Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us, and we know not where to begin to set them right.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 479
Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean “the foolish face of praise,” the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us. The muscles, not spontaneously moved, but moved by a low usurping willfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable sensation.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 483
For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend’s parlor. If this aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own, he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 486
Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid as being very vulnerable themselves.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 488
But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.</p></li><li><p>“For nonconformity, the world whips you with displeasure,” Emerson writes, and so it would be to the thinking person’s advantage to consider what expressions of disapproval really mean. It could mean nothing, after all, since conventional people’s displeasure changes like the wind. Displeasure from cultivated people is actually quite easy to deal with, because it is genteel but dealing with the displeasure of the “lowest” of people or the mob can be hard, because it is expressed loudly and ferociously.</p></li><li><p>While Emerson generally celebrates the common man and the individual in this essay, this passage makes clear his view that the individual in the aggregate—“the mob”—is not a force for good in American society.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 490
The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 492
But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place?

People judge who we are by our past acts and words, Emerson says, and so we are afraid to go against them today. Why drag around this “corpse of your memory,” Emerson asks, when really there is nothing to be lost by contradicting it? The 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>individual</a> who would be self-reliant should instead simply live in the present.</p></li><li><p>Emerson is attacking the Enlightenment ideals of reason and order as the basis of individual and societal standards and is instead embracing Romantic ideals by celebrating inconsistency and comparing memory to a “corpse.”</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 497
A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. “Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.” Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.</p></li><li><p>Such consistency is “the hobgoblin of little minds,” and every individual should freely contradict themselves without fear of the possibility of being misunderstood. Doing so would put a person in the company of all the famous and good people in Western culture—whom Emerson goes on to list.</p></li><li><p>His long list of historical figures who are celebrated for their inconsistency rather than their adherence to institutions also provides encouragement and inspiration for individuals who want to reject conventional morality.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 502
I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere.

In this pleasing, contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not, and see it not.

The force of character is cumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this. What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the imagination? The consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind. They shed an united light on the advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels.

Honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemeris. It is always ancient virtue. We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day.

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters/ralph-waldo-emerson rel=noopener>Emerson</a> reminds the reader that human 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/symbols/nature rel=noopener>nature</a> has its own internal consistency, so it truly is impossible for a person to do something against their own nature, as long as that person is honest with themselves. The self-reliant 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>individual</a> has as much consistency as any part of the natural world, a point Emerson makes with several metaphors that compare human nature to mountain ranges, pines, and a swallow. “The Andes or Himmaleh” mountains look jagged if observed from close up, for example, but look more uniform if one observes them from a distance. He also compares human nature with the zigzagging course of a ship that, seen on the large scale, sticks to a path that brings it to its final destination. Persistence in living according to one’s own conscience will always bring a person to the right course of action, and the impact of such actions is cumulative, a truth that is readily illustrated, Emerson believes, in the lives of people admired in the past for greatness.</p></li></ul><hr><p>43</p><p>I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency.

Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom, and trade, and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things.

Conformity to 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>society</a> should therefore be actively opposed, and Emerson hopes that the 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>individual</a> will “reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom, and trade, and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works” —that is, the Oversoul or God.</li></ul><p>43</p><p>Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation. The man must be so much, that he must make all circumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design;—and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients. A man Cæsar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius, that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man.

But the man in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these. To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem to say like that, “Who are you, Sir?” Yet they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict: it is not to command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke&rsquo;s house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke&rsquo;s bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact, that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason, and finds himself a true prince.</p></li><li><p>Given that the people commonly revered by 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>society</a> were just individuals with complete self-trust, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters/ralph-waldo-emerson rel=noopener>Emerson</a> says, modern 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>individuals</a> should take heart that their intuitions and self-trust are equal to anyone else’s. An ordinary person might think that there is nothing in them that “corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god,” or might feel that “a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an alien or forbidding air.” But a more self-reliant attitude would help the individual to understand that their own human perceptions are more important than the physical art or architecture they perceive: these objects are “suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties” and not anything to feel overawed by.</p></li><li><p>Emerson’s argument here is that individual perceptions are on par with or even more important than the actual works or texts that inspire those perceptions. His inversion of the usual hierarchy of sources of truth reflects both his belief in nonconformity and his total trust in the individual as a source of truth.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 543 ❗️
Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history, our imagination plays us false. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common day&rsquo;s work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the same. Why all this deference to Alfred, and Scanderbeg, and Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue?

The world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the eyes of nations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men and things, and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money but with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right of every man.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 549
The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct.

The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure, that it is profane to seek to interpose helps.

But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future.

This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear God himself, unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents and character they chance to see,—painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them, and are willing to let the words go; for, at any time, they can use words as good when occasion comes.</p></li><li><p>Rather than timidly looking to the past,

When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.

That thought, by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this. When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the foot-prints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name;—the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and experience. You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 594
There is somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision, there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea,—long intervals of time, years, centuries,—are of no account. This which I think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is called life, and what is called death.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters/ralph-waldo-emerson rel=noopener>Emerson</a> then explains the central point of the preceding discussion. He explains that his articulation of self-reliance is really only an approximation of the intuition from which it arose. Each person is ultimately responsible for discovering what morality is for themselves. The moment when each individual discovers their own sense of morality will be one of transcendence, “above passion,” beyond time, and more expansive than the “[v]ast spaces of

Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one fact the world hates, that the soul becomes; for that for ever degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 601
Why, then, do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch as the soul is present, there will be power not confident but agent. To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking.

We fancy it rhetoric when we speak of eminent virtue.

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>society</a> hates that moment of transcendence because it upsets traditional hierarchies and conventional notions of morality. This ultimate form of self-reliance, “eminent virtue,” is extremely powerful and it allows

All things real are so by so much virtue as they contain. Commerce, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war, eloquence, personal weight, are somewhat, and engage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action. I see the same law working in nature for conservation and growth. Power is in nature the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself. The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of the self-sufficing, and therefore self-relying soul.</p></li><li><p>Emerson respects even ordinary experiences—&ldquo;Hardship, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war, eloquence, personal weight”—because they are a little closer to that notion of virtue than conventional morality, and he sees the same “principle of conservation and growth” at work in

Let our simplicity judge them, and our docility to our own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches.</p></li><li><p>Emerson believes that with an understanding of the supreme importance of self-reliance as virtue, the individual can confidently dismiss conventional morality, engage with God by staying at home rather than looking elsewhere, and live a life of simplicity that is worth much more than traditional notions of what is good.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 615

Why should we assume the faults of our friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our hearth, or are said to have the same blood? All men have my blood, and I have all men’s. Not for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even to the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isolation must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation. At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet door, and say, “Come out unto us.” But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to annoy me, I give them by a weak curiosity.

This is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth. Check this lying hospitality and lying affection.

Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no law less than the eternal law I will have no covenants but proximities. I shall endeavor to nourish my parents, to support my family, to be the chaste husband of one wife,—but these relations I must fill after a new and unprecedented way. I appeal from your customs. I must be myself. I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the happier. If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy that I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly rejoices me, and the heart appoints. If you are noble, I will love you; if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions. If you are true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own. I do this not selfishly, but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and mine, and all men’s, however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth. Does this sound harsh to-day? You will soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine, and, if we follow the truth, it will bring us out safe at last.—But so you may give these friends pain. Yes, but I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their sensibility. Besides, all persons have their moments of reason, when they look out into the region of absolute truth; then will they justify me, and do the same thing.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 639
The populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the law of consciousness abides. There are two confessionals, in one or the other of which we must be shriven. You may fulfill your round of duties by clearing yourself in the direct, or in the reflex way. Consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father, mother, cousin, neighbor, town, cat, and dog; whether any of these can upbraid you. But I may also neglect this reflex standard, and absolve me to myself. I have my own stern claims and perfect circle. It denies the name of duty to many offices that are called duties. But if I can discharge its debts, it enables me to dispense with the popular code.

And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster.

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>society</a> is still mostly influenced by conformity as morality. He believes that given the culture of his age, spiritual solitude (if not actual solitude, given all the demands of day-to-day life) probably still provides the best chance of the 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters rel=noopener>individual</a> achieving self-reliance. If the individual cannot maintain that state, then at a minimum, Emerson believes they can still call out falseness wherever they see it, even if that means hurting or disappointing those who are closest to them; the obviousness of the individual’s virtue will eventually bring others around.</p></li><li><p>The self-reliant

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/self-reliance/characters/ralph-waldo-emerson rel=noopener>Emerson</a> responds to this possible accusation by pointing out that the self-reliant individual can absolve themselves of guilt by making sure they have met responsibilities to those closest to them, or, if those responsibilities do not accord with that individual’s notions of morality, by dismissing such concerns out of hand.</p></li><li><p>This sounds easy, but it is not, says Emerson, since it “demands something god-like” to face down the mandates of conventional morality and society</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 646 ❗️

Our age yields no great and perfect persons. We want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force, and do lean and beg day and night continually.

Emerson sees his age as one that is governed by fear, one that has produced no truly great people, and one that sorely lacks the ordinary people needed to reform what he sees as a broken American society.

That which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly. Prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and miraculous. Prayer that craves a particular commodity,—any thing less than all good,—is vicious.</li></ol><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 667
Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 668
But prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg. He will then see prayer in all action. The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap ends. Caratach, in Fletcher’s Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the mind of the god Audate, replies,—“His hidden meaning lies in our endeavors; Our valors are our best gods.”</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 674
Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities, if you can thereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and already the evil begins to be repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to them who weep foolishly, and sit down and cry for company, instead of imparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks, putting them once more in communication with their own reason.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 677
The secret of fortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide: him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out to him and embraces him, because he did not need it. We solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him, because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him. “To the persevering mortal,” said Zoroaster, “the blessed Immortals are swift.”</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 681
As men’s prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect. They say with those foolish Israelites, “Let not God speak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, and we will obey.” Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my brother, because he has shut his own temple doors, and recites fables merely of his brother’s, or his brother’s brother’s God.</p></li></ul><hr><ul><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 683 ❗️
Every new mind is a new classification. If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a Hutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes its classification on other men, and lo! a new system.

But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty, and man’s relation to the Highest.

It will happen for a time, that the pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his masters mind. But in all unbalanced minds, the classification is idolized, passes for the end, and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built.

It is only as a man puts off all foreign support, and stands alone, that I see him to be strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every recruit to his banner. Is not a man better than a town?</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 766
Ask nothing of men, and in the endless mutation, thou only firm column must presently appear the upholder of all that surrounds thee. He who knows that power is inborn, that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so perceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly rights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs, works miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 769
So use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble with her, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. But do thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the chancellors of God. In the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained the wheel of Chance, and shalt sit hereafter out of fear from her rotations.</p></li><li><p>Highlight(pink) - Location 771
A political victory, a rise of rents, the recovery of your sick, or the return of your absent friend, or some other favorable event, raises your spirits, and you think good days are preparing for you.

Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.</p></li></ul><hr><a href=#notes><h3 id=notes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Notes</h3></a><p>Amount: 9</p><ul><li><a href=/Humanities-greatest-innovators-are-ones-who-defied-social-norms-and-followed-their-own-intuitions/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Humanities-greatest-innovators-are-ones-who-defied-social-norms-and-followed-their-own-intuitions/>Humanities greatest innovators are ones who defied social norms and followed their own intuitions</a></li><li><a href=/We-must-embrace-what-makes-us-unique-in-order-to-be-able-to-acquire-novel-insights/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/We-must-embrace-what-makes-us-unique-in-order-to-be-able-to-acquire-novel-insights/>We must embrace what makes us unique in order to be able to acquire novel insights</a></li><li><a href=/Children-babies-and-animals-act-independently-without-caring-what-others-will-think/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Children-babies-and-animals-act-independently-without-caring-what-others-will-think/>Children, babies, and animals act independently without caring what others will think</a></li><li><a href=/To-be-self-reliant-and-innovative-requires-not-conforming-to-social-norms/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/To-be-self-reliant-and-innovative-requires-not-conforming-to-social-norms/>To be self-reliant and innovative requires not conforming to social norms</a></li><li><a href=/You-should-follow-your-own-morality-even-if-it-means-the-disapproval-of-society/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/You-should-follow-your-own-morality-even-if-it-means-the-disapproval-of-society/>You should follow your own morality even if it means the disapproval of society</a></li><li><a href=/Identifying-with-a-group-obscures-your-true-character-and-makes-you-predictible/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Identifying-with-a-group-obscures-your-true-character-and-makes-you-predictible/>Identifying with a group obscures your true character and makes you predictible</a></li><li><a href=/A-self-reliant-person-should-not-be-afraid-to-contradict-themselves/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/A-self-reliant-person-should-not-be-afraid-to-contradict-themselves/>A self-reliant person should not be afraid to contradict themselves</a></li><li><a href=/Our-seemingly-contradictory-actions-justify-themselves-when-viewed-from-a-distance/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Our-seemingly-contradictory-actions-justify-themselves-when-viewed-from-a-distance/>Our seemingly contradictory actions justify themselves when viewed from a distance</a></li><li><a href=/People-commonly-revered-by-society-were-those-with-complete-trust-in-themselves/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/People-commonly-revered-by-society-were-those-with-complete-trust-in-themselves/>People commonly revered by society were those with complete trust in themselves</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#D0A4FF}</style><script src=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Bryce Mcalister using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://thecosmos.brycemcalister.com>Home</a></li><li><a href></a></li><li><a href></a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
